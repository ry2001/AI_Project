  It took six hours to set upI am a techy electronics engineer.  I have dozens of patents in electronics and have written thousands of lines of computer code, in three different programming languages.  But this watch is quite a challenge.When I tried to pair the watch to the phone, the phone said I must update the phone to OS 14.8.1.  Yet I have always had ""automatic updates"" ""on"" in the phone menu.So I spent a half-hour updating to OS 14.8.1.I tried to pair the watch to the phone again and the phone said my OS must be updated.  But I had just updated it.  So I called apple support.  They directed me to update my OS to 15.1.  Why was I previously directed to update to 14.8.1 when that was obsolete?  Updating to 15.1 took an hour!Next when I tried to pair the watch, the message on the phone says that I need to charge the watch.  I examined the watch charge cable and it must plug into a USB ""C"" charger which is not included with the watch.  Do you have such a charger?  I didn't even know such chargers existed.  I have ten chargers, including several made by apple, and they all only accept the original USB plug, called USB ""A"".I recall reading a few weeks ago that apple was no longer including chargers.  I thought, that's ok, we all have lots of chargers.  But nobody has USB ""C"" chargers, they are very new.So I ordered a USB ""C"" charger.The charger arrived I started the pairing process.  But the phone stuck for 30 minutes during the pairing process so I called support.  They couldn't get it to work by the standard way, which is to update the watch software, so they opted to install without updating the watch software.  That worked with lots of hand holding and took about 45 minutesAll together I spent about six hours getting the phone to work.Has apple lost their mind?

  The Apple Watch 7 is nice. Especially if you are upgrading from a version that is several years old.But beware, it only comes with a charger that is USB C. So if you don’t already have a usb power brick or old Watch charger, you have to buy that and won’t be able to charge your watch

  This is my first Apple Watch. I feel incredibly stupid for waiting this long to buy one! This thing is SO amazing! I decided to go with the Graphite Stainless case. It’s certainly more expensive than the aluminum models which are also super nice. The watch is very easy to setup and connects nearly instantly to your IPhone. The apps and available customizable watch faces are nearly limitless. The 45mm fits my wrist perfectly - it’s not too big. It looks amazing! Make sure to order a USB C charger when you order your watch. I’m not sure why it’s not included. Other than that it’s perfect!! Absolutely love it. Probably one of the best little things I’ve ever bought for me!

  So far. Got the watch. Turned it on. When it tried to link to my Iphone it said I needed to update my Iphone. So I updated my Iphone which took hours. By that time the watch had run out of the factory charge. Dead watch. They give you a magnetic charger which has a USB C male end which fits nothing I have. Seriously! I paid over $700 for this thing and they couldn't include a real charger?  So, at this point it sucks.

  I’m upgrading from a series 1, so it is a completely different watch. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Most of the heart monitoring functions only work with people older than 22 which is frustrating for me especially since I paid for the watch, so I should get access to all the features. Nonetheless, I really like the starlight Apple Watch and band. It’s very subtle and nice to look at. Hopefully braided solo loops get a sale soon bc I really would like one. It is a pain that they don't give power bricks, but this is the new age. I highly suggest you purchase many usb c power bricks and switch all cords from usb a to usb c. Anker has great ones and you can always find deals for them.

  Looking thru all the reviews and most of the negative ones are about battery life not satisfactory. I have tested my Apple Watch series 7 with not having the “always on” display and found that if I turn that setting off I only burn 25-30% battery in a full work day 10 hrs. I don’t know about you but if I’m not looking at my watch, why would I need the display on? When you turn “always on” display feature off watch display comes on only when you look at it immediately and that’s perfect for me. Just go to display and brightness on your phone in the Apple Watch app and turn off “always on” . Think about if your phone had a setting where it was always on……it would be dead in no time and everyone would be complaining the battery doesn’t last.

  I am 73 years old. The week after I purchased this watch I fell. This watch immediately alerted to ask if I needed emergency help. The emergency button was on screen available for me to press if I was injured or could not get up. It requested confirmation that I did not need help. I wish I had it earlier this year when I had broken my foot from a fall, rather than hobbling to a phone I could have just pressed the emergency button. Thank you, Apple Watch.

  Phone is awesome. However on day 2 I scratched the watch doing dishes. I thought the watch was indestructible. Come to find out it can crack and scratch.

Make sure you get apple care through carrier think it’s cheaper. Note stainless steel van still scratch but it is quite durable. Other than that this is my 1st Apple Watch and the ease of use is phenomenal as well as the merging of my cell phone with the watch. Mom gave it as a gift and I absolutely love the fact that I can get a real time pulse ox+ hr+ and ekg! Fall detection is great cause I am a diabetic!!!

  I love the watch and am sure once I get cell service added it will do exactly what I need it to do.  I got this solely for the “Fall alert” function. I find it a  MUCH cheaper alternative than life alert and those kinds of services.Many other features - as listed in detail on the watch description. BUT **IMPORTANT TO KNOW**The “charger” included is the cord only! It has the round disk type on one end of the cord and USB-C end on the other.  It ONLY plugs into a USB-C charging cube.  The cube is NOT included.  You can buy one here for relatively cheap.  But I recommend you buy one when you order the watch if you don’t already have one.  I have an old Galaxy 9S phone that has a C port, so I can charge it on that for now. But that is a short term solution.  My other option was to wait 5 days for Amazon before I can use my watch.Watch did come with 87% charge, but set up took battery down to 55%.  So you will need a charging cube when you get the watch.  Again- a cube with a C port… NOT a lightening or regular USB port.

  Cons: So if you’re switching from a fitbit for your first Apple Watch like myself you’ll miss your Fitbit it doesn’t track your calories all day like your Fitbit because it doesn’t automatically detect your work out/calorie burn.  It doesn’t track your sleep details the same either I almost want to buy a Fitbit..that’s just weird though wearing 2watches…last bad thing is the battery you have to charge it every day oh…and mine wasn’t charging I had to go to Best Buy and get another charger cable I got the one with usb port then it started charging…screw that other one it doesn’t work.Pros: it’s fun technology I like how my ring notifications come out on my watch and it shows the video. I like how I am washing my hands and it times it. It’s good to check your blood oxygen and heart rateBut that’s it pretty much I can still control my my music like on my fit bit I don’t really text people from my watch I guess that’s the other benefit but other than that nothing really amazing about it. I didn’t get cellular you don’t need it if you always have your phone near by. It connected to my  phone quick. I miss my Fitbit.though the only sad part

  None too pleased about a couple things: Made in China, and didn’t come with a USB-C charging block. I happen to be temporarily staying near my parents’ home in the middle of nowhere where I can’t just drive down the road to pick one up, which means I have to drive 30 miles and it’s continually snowing here with bad roads or order one and wait. When you’re from Atlanta and have everything at your fingertips, this sort of frustration should not be encountered, particularly when dealing with Apple. We Apple buyers have grown accustomed to the finer details and Apple cheaping out leaving us inconvenienced like this is extremely the wrong move by Apple. For me, it’s not about the cost to go buy a $10 USB-C block, it’s the inconvenience and hassle it poses me that I have to drive 30 miles one way in the stupid snow to do it. Geeze. Now my pretty new watch sits here dead.

  I ordered this on 11/26 and received it at 6am on the 27th (gotta love rush overnight shipping being a prime member).This was an upgrade for me coming from the Apple Watch 3 and then going to Whoop for a year and a half. Ultimately decided back on Apple for the smart watch features.Few things to note:1. The screen is a lot bigger if you’re used to a  41 or 42mm. Personally love the bigger screen but I also have a bigger wrist so it fits very well.2. The watch does NOT come with the “butt” part of the charger you plug into the wall. If you have a newer charger for your apple devices (Ie when I got my iPad earlier this year I had gotten a full charger that I can swap the wires out with this) you’re all set. If not, go buy a charger when you’re purchasing this3. The watch, for me at least, was closer to 90% charged so wouldn’t have been a huge deal if I had to Amazon prime or run to the store for a charger4. Features are advances compared to the 3 but still have a lot of similarities.5. Box comes with two band sizes. Small and then medium/large6. The packaging is very well done. I was impressed when I opened it upOverall I’m happy with this purchase (I knew I would be) as I spent probably 2 months comparing the new Apple Watch to the Garmin to find what would be best for me and my specific needs.

  Apple does a lot of stuff well.  Mac Books, iMac, iPad, and iPhone.  As a fitness tracker it is excellent and how it integrates so well with the iPhone, but as a watch is another matter altogether.  The short battery life, the rectangular watch face limiting details, and no seconds indication when in low-power-always-on-display mode are all big drawbacks.The Apple Watch will get you at around 26 hours on a full charge. This is completely unacceptable if you are frequent traveler or someone who falls asleep with their watch on.  It is one more thing to charge in such a short time.  Your phone you put down after some time, but a watch is used more frequently.Sometimes in 2022 or by 2024, Apple should introduce an Apple Watch which has greater than 36 hours in a round face.  Until then, save your money.

  It took me a while to decide to upgrade my apple watch. Hard to justify a smart watch over $300, in my opinion, however, my Series 3 was so slow, took forever to install an update, no space for apps/data storage, etc...I got a Fitbit Charge 5 as a temporary place holder, tried to convince myself I liked it more than an Apple Watch, ultimately I came back to Apple.  I opted for the 41mm Series 7 because I didn't need an extra 4mm for another $100.It moves so seamlessly, fast to charge (lightyears ahead of the series 3), lots of new watch face templates to choose from, beautiful edge to edge display. Of course you can choose to have ""Always on Display"" but that will quickly deplete your battery life.Ultimately, just get the upgrade that is within your budget and you won't regret it!

  I felt like my Fitbit had been old enough to start being less accurate. And given that I have fallen into all of the Apple products, it seemed like the Apple Watch was a no brainer. It has been nothing but frustrating. I can’t figure out how to turn specific things on or off, and it even vibrates at four in the morning to tell me if it needs to be recharged, or if there’s any other insignificant thing going on. I turned off notifications and can’t figure it out. Also, I really appreciate it looking at Fitbit and looking at my steps. Not having to click 1 million things to see my heartbeat or my steps for the day. I can’t figure it out how to answer the phone, it’s not working with half of my stuff, it acts like it sends an email and it doesn’t.  I am completely bummed about spending money on some thing that was supposed to be helpful. I should’ve stuck with the Fitbit.

  Initially, I never wanted a Smart Watch. Then, my husband got one & I thought his was pretty cool. SO I started looking at one similar to what he had (a Fossil), but was unable to find something I liked, or could even tolerate. Since I have (and love) my iPhone, I decided to look into the Apple watched, and found this one on Amazon. Although the price was rather off-putting, my husband & I decided that, with all of the health benefits the watch has, I should go ahead & order it. Well, since getting the watch. I've worn it all day, every day, and I simply think the watch is AMAZING! I can check my heart rate throughout the day (something I need to do), and keep an eye on my blood sugar levels (since I am a Type One Diabetic, and have the DexCom App on my iPhone, it also shows on my watch--how cool!). The watch encourages me to stand up a couple of times an hour, which is great, since I work from home & sit at a computer for eight hours/day. I love that I can make/receive phone calls from the watch, too. In the week that I've had my watch, I've found that I use my watch more than I use my iPhone. And to think that I was so.very.opposed to getting a Smart Watch... Now, I don't know how I ever got by without it.

  The item works fine. Lots of great features for sure. However there were a couple of issues that make this product over priced. The first disappointment was that it only comes with half a charger! Luckily my wife already had a charger. The next was that this thing really only has a days worth of battery life. I have to take it off so often and forget to put it back on. I bought this thing to monitor health, which it does very well, however i have to take it off to charge every single night which means heart health isn’t tracked at night. For 500 plus dollars, this product should come with a charger (come on!) and it should have a better battery. Going to return it if I can.

  Lots more info and options than the under $100 fitness watches. Really enjoying Fitness+ workout options. Doubt I will ever go back to a lesser model. Battery life isn’t what i had hoped/expected.

As far as accuracy, often doesn’t recognize that I am standing and have been for several hours simply because my arms aren’t moving enough while working at my standing desk. It does provide notice, though, so i can flap my arms and achieve my rings. Good motivation overall. It’s a lot of money compared to other fitness watches, but it’s worth it!

  This is about my 7th smart ""watch"". I've have a couple of Fitbits, a Jawbone, a Zenwatch 3 (prettiest of the bunch), a Samsung Galaxy, and an Amazfit Bip (good watch for the money). I've basically got a smart watch museum. I got the Apple Watch because, honestly, I'm getting older and I wanted the fall detection and health features. I've had it for a couple of weeks and here's what I think, from bad to good.1. Battery life sucks. It'll get through one day, but that's it. The Bip would last for 3 weeks on a charge.2. The screen isn't great in direct sun. It's better than some others, but doesn't hold a candle to the Bip, which was somehow reflective in bright light, sort of like a Kindle.3. The sleep tracking is ok, about what you'd expect from a movement detecter, but the app for it isn't very good. Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now.4. It has some very nice watch faces, with custom complications. Best of the bunch.5. Very comfortable to wear. The big stem doesn't get in the way at all.6. The health features work great. It accurately tracks you pulse, and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand. I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.It has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun. Lots of other things. The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it's unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were.

  I’ve always been a smart watch user, however, being that I recently converted to Apple after finding that I enjoy their products and software, I needed a new watch.This product is beautiful. The screen is high resolution, it’s fast, and you can seamlessly transfer between phone and watch. The screen is small, but it displays a lot more information at once than I really expected it to, so using it isn’t a headache.I love the utility. Everything you think a smart watch should do, this watch CAN do. From needing a calculator, to switching your songs, tracking your activity & workouts- basing the calories burned on your heart rate. I exercise a lot and appreciate the information smart watches can bring. You can text, call, read emails, make payments. Etc.The only issue I have with the watch is an issue I have with apple products in general- if you’re like me and this is your first apple watch- you’re probably going to have to watch a tutorial or two in order to know how to turn it on, and to know what this watch can really do for you. Apple does offer “helpful tips” but those tips aren’t really comprehensive as to how to use your watch. I probably still don’t know all I can do with it, which is cool, but frustrating.

  we were excited about the medical monitoring.  we are an apple family with an iphone, 2 ipads, and a imac, none of which are compatible with the apple watch!  no mention of strict requirements on the amazon website. our only option was to buy a new iphone or return the apple watch and investigate alternative medical monitoring options.  shame on apple's merchandising philosophy!

  This is my first Apple Watch, so far I’m loving the convenience of it. However….. after 4 hours last night and 3 hours on the phone this morning with Verizon technical support (3 different tiers of folks) - I still don’t have cellular functionality on the watch, which is the whole reason I purchased this one!

  First, I just want to say that it DOES NOT come with a charger block for the USB type C, so if you don’t already have one, buy it along side it as I had to take a trip to two different Walmarts and a target to find one.Next, I highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend you measure your wrist and go by the recommended wrist size that apple suggest for each watch. I’m fairly okay in terms of body weight sitting at 210 lbs and dropping with a height of 6’1.  My wrist size was measured to be 210mm so it was recommended that I go for the 45mm version but instead I decided to look at reviews on YouTube and I saw that majority of them recommended the 41mm version as the 45mm was “too bulky and was like wearing a TV screen on their wrist” so because of that I went for the 41mm. When I placed it on my wrist with the band, it felt like I was wearing the smallest watch ever, it felt as if I was trying to put on a watch made for children. Then I went to my friend’s who had a 45mm Apple Watch and tried his on and it fit perfectly, lesson learnt, listen to the manufacturer instead of random people in a video.

  Watch is fine overall, does all as expected. The band, however broke the second time I took it off (see picture). Highly recommend buying at least 1-2 more bands when you purchase the watch to avoid the down time. The cheaper bands appear to be higher quality than the one it comes with.

  This is apparently the best smart watch for iPhone owners and it is a great watch.  While it is disappointing that Apple doesn't include a power adapter for most devices, just plan on spending the extra money to get yourself a USB-C adapter when you buy any new Apple products.  The overall app integration and health features make this a great watch and daily companion.  If you want your daily step count to appear on the watch face, you need to download a pedometer app and then add the steps to your watch face setup, but once you do that it's a great feature.  It will probably take several months to learn 50% of the watch features, but so far it looks great.

  The watch 7 packaging consists of two standalone boxes for your selected watch and band, wrapped together. The watch performs great, and the extra screen space makes a difference. The keyboard functionality actually works even for my relatively big fingers. The bigger watch works perfectly with bands that marked for the 44mm ( even seem like a better fit to the wristcam camera bands). I believe the apps needs updating as most of them have some funky behavior with the new keyboard and voice functionality. Will probably change to 5 stars soon when that happens - but basically do not assume full screen or keyboard for older watch apps without an update.

  It's extremely irritating that Apple will send you a $400 watch with absolutely no way to charge it. It's so exhausting how they keep changing things like this to force you to buy new accessories. They didn't bother to include the required USB-C power adapter with the watch, something that almost no one actually has. So you need to shell out another $20 and hope your watch, with horrendous battery life, doesn't die before you can get one. Either give us a power cord you can plug into a standard USB driver or give us an adapter with a USB-C plug. This is really ridiculous.

  I’ve previously owned an Apple Watch (series 1). A lot has changed since then. The set up took me hours. I had to update my iPhone to the lasted iOS. Okay. Then the actual pairing the Watch to my iPhone was time consuming. It keep telling me it wouldn’t pair. It took me quite a while to get it to eventually pair. Now once it “paired” it was once again needing a Watch app update to fully connect.Another downside. No charging block included. So it costs me another $20 to get a charging block as my iPhone 11 Pro Max was still utilizing the traditional USB to Lightening charging cable and block when I bought it in 2019.Battery life. Much lower than my previous Apple Watch and even my Fitbit. Chargers fast but definitely needs charging every 24-36 hours. Which makes it hard to utilize the sleep tracking option.Once I got passed all this, I have really enjoyed the Watch. Next time I hope the process goes more smoothly. I don’t remember back in 2015/2016 it taking this long or difficult to set up. And if I remember correctly I also got a charging block AND cable.**Please excuse any typos

  The watch arrived with a. dead battery. After a three hour charge using a USB-C charger which I had also purchased, the watch remained charged for less than 15 minutes. It is charging now overnight but surely a brand new watch battery is supposed to be a little charged then recharge easily. After 4 days, It now recharges fine. The ECG app is extremely poor and Blood Oxgen is very slow compared to pulse oximeter. I bought for these features. Apple does say not for “medical “ purposes. I am not a fitness freak. I am learning to use features that require purchase of additional software that helps me. Pay attention to your purposes for buying this watch. I hated it but have learned to use certain additional software to my benefit and am having no more battery problems so I am now pleased.

  if you've never used apple watch before, please note that it's in general a one-day watch. If that's a dealbreaker, you should look somewhere else.This watch is absolutely beautiful. The screen is bright and texts are crisp. It's blazingly fast compared to my apple watch 4. Thanks to the bigger screen we can view more information on the watch face. I thoroughly enjoy all the smart features apple brings to this watch and its ecosystem. Think of this apple watch as a mini iphone but can track a lot of fitness features and health info. If you are interested in heart rate, The Quantified Scientist youtube channel did a thorough study and showed that this watch's hr is very accurate.I put the charger on my desk and when I work I leave it there for charging. It's charged super quick, like 15m or so and I never ran out of battery. For daily life of WFH, my watch's battery is always 90%. My usage is checking notification every now and then a roughly 1hr of workout (indoor so no gps).if you have an apple watch 4, the only main diff I'd say here is the spo2 sensor. If that's not important to you, I think it's not worth the upgrade though because the apple watch 4 is still very very fast.

  I had the Apple Watch series 6 and hated how short the battery would work. This one’s battery lasts way longer, a lot quicker to charge, item was as described, amazing resolution, I love everything about this watch honestly. Super simple to install and start using, I believe it took me 30 mins tops! I love how it is way more accurate on my sleep, heart rate, and all my movements and stats. My issue with series 6 is it wasn’t accurate as well, and wouldn’t track my sleep no matter how much troubleshooting I did. This one I have my sleep tracked on here, and way better application overall. I highly recommend this watch for people wanting something to have that does so much more than other watches and has a iPhone so they are connected all day long.

  After 7 iterations, I finally got my first Apple Watch. The reason why I held up so long was because of a simple question: WHY DO I NEED AN APPLE WATCH?For the most part, I am pretty simplistic and live by minimal means. The reason I FINALLY got an Apple Watch was because I wanted something truly waterproof, durable, and has great utility. The AP7 does it all. I'm also getting older, and I want to keep track of my health. I want to have access to as many metrics to analyze my health.The AP7 helps keep me focusing on the bigger picture. I'm able to handle my notifications without having the need to lift my phone which does, in some form, interrupt my productivity. The next biggest reason why I am happy with this particular variant is because of sleep tracking. To maximize my day-to-day productivity, I need the best quality of sleep. So apps like SleepWatch are a great tool to use to track sleep.It is really easy to connect to my iPhone 13 Pro, and the whole setup process took about 15 minutes including updates.However, my biggest drawback for the AP7 is its battery life. It doesn't bother me so much, but I have to charge it every night.It looks amazing, has professional and luxury vibes, and is pretty customizable. There are non-OEM bands on here that are relatively inexpensive and affordable especially for those on a budget to personalize the AP7 to their liking.Overall, I am pretty happy with it! Cheers.

  After spending $800 for this thing, I had to spend another $20 to get a USB-C charger cube. I must have 20 USB-A cubes, but this is not compatible. Of all the zillion devices I have, none need a USB-C female charging outlet. I understand why USB-C is needed, but not to include a charger cube?With the battery arriving DOA, I had to charge it from my laptop which was not very convenient since my laptop USB-C port is used for several other purposes.They must have saved $2. Oh ... add it right to the bottom line.There are also no instructions included whatsoever.What a bad first impression.Setup took over two hours with required updates, downloads, authorizations, pairings, log-ins, etc. I suppose a lengthy setup is understandable ... but did I mention no charger and no instructions? I'm not likely to get over that. Really ... how cheap can you get Apple?It is interesting to note that I got a 31 page printed manual along with my Apple branded USB-C charger cube I had to order, but absolutely nothing along with my watch!!How cheap can you get Apple? How cheap can you get?It's an amazing device, but products that don't present themselves well when opening the box are doomed to failure in the market. I am both upset with and shocked at Apple for this.3 stars is all you get. All the incredible engineering that went into this was lost on me immediately by the decisions made by some idiot product/marketing manager.I am soooo done with Apple products.

  I would have chosen another color, but this was available.  The sports band feels like skin and is extremely comfortable.I got the watch to track my health readings  during sleep.  My CPAP was under FDA recall not to use.  So I was monitoring my O2 level sleeping without CPAP.  O2 levels were dangerously low so I got another CPAP and they came up to normal levels.  The watch clearly showed this.The watch has so many more features that I may sometime use.  I recommend the series 7 watch.

  I got the Series 7.. I was really worried that the 41 mm watch face was going to be too small but getting anything bigger would’ve looked crazy on my wrist. Beware you absolutely need to buy a USB/C charger base it is kind of silly that it doesn’t give you everything that you need to properly charge it. I feel the least Apple could do after spending $400 on a watch is to give you a base to charge it with I saw some reviews that said people wish they would not have bought the product just because of that and I think that’s rather silly. It works great it was easy to set up it took only a few minutes compared to  buying a new iPhone and having to set that up and it taking hours. I’m absolutely satisfied with the product it works great and even though it’s only the GPS version (doesn’t have its own separate phone line….

  It's far more beautiful in person than shown here. I bought a $15 black chain and it's beautiful: perfect for me. I've always been fascinated by watches but never owned one I enjoyed so much. Also, my watch tells me, accurately, my Oxygen level. Some folks have claimed it's inaccurate, but it's correct the way I use it, which I will explain here. Please note: I've compared it to my oximeter which is absolutely accurate compared to one of the world's largest hospitals oxygen reporting machines, and it's inline with both.At sleep my oxygen goes down, so it's accuracy is imperative to me. I wear it on my left wrist slightly further away from my hands. I use my hands a lot playing guitar, doing dishes, typing.The ECC is fascinating, but I'm blessed to not have need of it, at this point.I like the awards and motivational achievement things.I love how it finds my phone, my daughter's phone and wife's phone.The display is fantastic. Beautiful. The faces are wonderful.The price dropped dramatically and I nearly sent it back. I didn't because I love the watch. The original band it came with really is awful.I love the way it charges with a magnetic no plug charger. It charges very fast. I have to charge it once a day.The speaker and mic are okay. They work, although I feel funny talking into my watch. Futuristic in a retro way.The band it comes with did not work for me at all. It has two sizes, but it appears flimsy and keeps falling off. On the plus side it fell many times, and I nearly returned it for that, but it did not break, so I did not. Watch bands are plentiful and all are better than the OEM.Does not take blood pressure, as far as I can tell. That's about all it doesn't do.I'm not yet certain about subscribing to the apple watch thing. I have a 3 month trial period before I will decide. So far I haven't needed that aspect of it. I suppose if I were to work out on my own it would be very good.Great watch -- beautiful, appears to be water proof. Strong. Great display. So long as it lasts I'm very happy. Replace the OEM band immediately. It's been my experience that my Apple products last a long time.My daughter and wife both want one.

  This is my very 1st apple watch and so I got the GPS version because I did not know if I would like it or not or really use it and now, I'm happy I ordered This!I find myself using this for everything now and almost never take my phone out of my pocket when I am out on the go I can read all my Facebook messages and my text messages form the watch! although one thing I don't like is that when I get the message it pops up the message on the watch as soon as I get it so others can read it if you don't look right away and read or clear it from notifications think it may be a setting or something that could be fixed with an update but have not really looked at all the settings on the watch yet just used it as is after setting up.

  Got this to check my O2 levels and my aFib. And so my son knows when I fall since my balance is like a one year old’s. Like that it connects with my phone and I can bluetooth music without exposing the phone to my cleaning or planting.Don’t like that the apps are geared towards young athletic types. We need the activity meter to have a “rehab” calibration and one for senior seniors (over 70).  Completely different needs and abilities.The huge boomer population is getting on, and the medical aspects of this watch are helpful, but there needs to be a bit more development geared towards differently abled. Half the icons are so small I can’t tell what they are. the list layout is heaven sent. Wish I could design my own icons because even the ones I can see are not intuitive.I like the starlight color and the bigger size. The warm brushed beige is flattering to aging complexions. Need a couple pastels or soft hues to balance the harsh dark primary colors. Cornflower, cocoa, turquoise, and such.Still learning how to navigate the watch with my big arthritic fingers. Apple should design a fingertip stylus that attaches securely to the band, waiting to be slipped on.

  I love the feature of the screen staying on without wrist movement. Watch charges fast and the battery life is better than the older Series 3 I had. I previously had the 42mm and debated on the 41mm vs the 45mm. Went with the 41mm because I have small wrists and it's hard to get bands to fit. I do not miss the 1mm difference from my old watch. There is increased screen size on the Series 7 which makes up for the size difference. I also love the new features. Definitely a winner.

  New to the Apple watch and am very satisfied with switching over from Fitbit. Love the screen response, always on feature, and the size/weight. The water proof feature, heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 monitoring are great features as well. I was also concerned about the battery life but am surprised not only how long it has been lasting, but also how quickly it charges. My only complaints (coming from a former Fitbit user) are that the work out tracking detection is about 20-30 seconds delayed, the sleep tracking is not as detailed as Fitbit (if that matters to you), and the App could offer a few more customization options. Overall, very satisfied and would definitely purchase again.

  I like it. I've wanted one for years and bit the bullet. Works well for tracking workout activity, receiving notifications/messages, changing/selecting music without needing to pull out my phone. Battery lasts around a day and a half. You should plan on having to charge it every day, I would say.Problem: You literally cannot charge your watch out of the box if you do not have a usbc charging block. I own no devices that utilize this. I had to shell out more money after spending $350 on this watch. This is unacceptable. I would understand if there was no charging block for a normal usb plug in, everyone has one laying around.

  I like the watch very much. At the current price it’s a pretty good deal for Apple users.However I  would prefer a single app that consolidates all the data in a single, drill down type dashboard. As it is, it takes me a while to figure out which app’s settings drives what data on the watch. Such as resetting the stand goal. Still looking for that….Also would love to know more detail on how many exercise minutes in cardio or  fat burning or REM vs restful sleep.Still, it connects quicker to my Ring app than iPhone, makes answering calls much simpler than trying to find the phone, and has the essential stats anyone needs to track fitness.Just think all the supporting apps are battery intensive and kinda confusing.

  Kinda small compare to 44mmThe main issue is it limit too much:I can’t change or design the watch face freely, or those simple design need some third party app.The notification also too limited, when I using  my phone, I can not get vibrate from the watch anymore, that lead a problem is1. when turn on “do not disturb”, all silenced like no watch;2. when I planned get notification from watch shake and accidentally open my phone, loud noise from my phone come out - due to some app’s bad design I can’t use silence mode if I want to hear something.??????????????I know Apple like to make decisions for customers, but not this one.Maybe blame bad app developers who silence their app when phone at silence mode &when there is a positive media volume.

  This is only day 2 of my apple smart watch. So far the capacity of the series 7 far out weighs the fitbit versa 2 accept it doesn't seem to collect as much sleep data as the fitbit did. I have insomnia and liked seeing when I got a good nights sleep but overall this watch has a lot more to offer. I am new to it so I will most likely come back to modify this review. As usual the setup was pretty intuitive. Remember if you are looking for data collected to look in the Apple Health App that comes with your iphone. I love tekky stuff so this watch will keep me busy for a while. I paid almost 3 times as much for the Apple watch as I did my versa 2 so I am expecting a lot more. I may adjust the star ratings as I become more aquanted with the watch. I was a little disappointed in the charging cable not including the power adaptor. It has a magnetic end that attaches to the watch, which is nice because if you use a screen protector you won't have to  remove it to charge the watch. The other end however is a type-C and I had  no power adaptors with a type-C. I was able to  charge it with my tablet and I also have a couple of portable power supplies that have type-C so I am good until my new power adaptor arrives. I was reading in a forum and another person complained about the same thing and someone pointed out that it is our responsibilty to find out what's in the box. That's true but for that price I still think you should get one with the watch. Apple claims it's to help the enviornment. Power adaptors sometimes get legs and walk away on there own so I think it best to provide one.

  After years of using Pebble and Amazfit watches I decided to go Apple Watch because of the heart monitoring features and solid support for my iOS devices (phone, tablet). The watch works great. Getting it setup with my iPhone 12 Pro was just a non-event. It worked instantly.The display is amazing. Just gorgeous. The reaction time with using the screen, crown, or button is instant. No lag at all.The only issue I have is the battery. I never went to Apple Watch before Series 7 because 24 or less hours of battery life and having to carry a custom charging base everywhere I got is just untenable.Series 7 docs state even with always on display the average is a goal of 18 hours. HA. I'm lucky to get 10 or 12 and it doesn't even do much during the day. I've tested others like several Android watches over the years too and none were this consumptive of battery.The sleep tracking works fine, but it's not comfortable to wear in bed all night. I don't think any ""band"" is.Overall, I like it. I'll use it. It works super well with my iPhone and the apps are great. But honestly, if I had known the battery life was this short with average usage, I would have probably gone with another Amazfit or the Pebble based FitBit Versa 3.

  First time Apple Watch user and still learning the ropes and abilities of the watch. I don’t know why it would take some people forever to set their watch up as it personally took me less than 30 minutes. As long as you have ios15, it shouldn’t take you that long. So just make sure your phone is running the latest software version before doing watch set up.Keep in mind, you MUST order a separate charging block as they do not include one for you but this should not prevent you from setting up the watch. My watch came 70% charged so I was able to do everything I needed to set up.I got the Starlight 41mm delivered yesterday and it is beautiful. I’m still playing around with the watch but it’s fun. I’ve used the ECG and Blood Oxygen apps and those were neat. I’ve never had an AW before so I can’t compre the battery life to previous modes but it’s definitely holding it’s charge very well.

  Having only owned the device for approximately one month, I can only say a couple things. Set up was very easy. I really enjoy the flexibility of being able to leave my home without my phone and have access to basic applications. However the third-party world of apps has not caught up to this device. There are so many developers for so many companies that have not prioritized building more useful and GUI friendly apps that it is my biggest frustration. A lot of common names that you would expect to have rocksolid apps for this device have definitely D prioritized it or neglected it completely. Perfect example, sorry Amazon, but Audible is without question the worst app I’ve tried to use on this device. However there are others that are  not as bad but pretty close.  I’m also not used to a device that has 24 hours of run time. This means when I need to travel with this and hope to use the majority of the features, I have to bring this stupid charging puck everywhere I go. So I’m not sure how that’s gonna impact my opinion in the long term.

  I upgraded from the series 3 to the 7 because my 3 wasn’t picking up my heart rate during exercise as well as it used to- otherwise the watch was fine- so now I have the 7 and it also doesn’t pick up my heart rate consistently through exercise. It’s very frustrating because if it’s not accurate then the calories burned aren’t accurate either. It’s the main reason I wear this thing so I’d like it to actually work. I’m very much considering going back the the Fitbit, that one had a much more accurate exercise tracker. Otherwise I do like it but I find that it’s very similar to my older series 3 and I’m not quite sure what the upgrade is actually good for- could have saved a lot of money to tell the truth. I also really can’t stand the Apple gives a charger that is not universal and they don’t include a wall piece. This also happened with my phone, the adapters that are available do not have 2 ports so you need a new adapter for each charger, it’s just inconvenient. USB ports are standard all over the place but you can’t use them for newer apple products.

  It's a great watch. I used fitbit, samsung, and some cheaper watches, but all were a waste compared to this watch. Love how it integrates with my phone and reminds me to get off my butt all day long. As a heart patient, it monitors many things I need to keep an eye on, like heart rate, blood oxygen lever, and so much more through the health app. Glad I finally bit the bullet and made this purchase. A little disappointed in battery life compared to other products. Can't use the sleep monitoring benefits as I have to charge it every night.

  Charger didn’t work. Apple needed to back erase the contents from the watch to be able to send me a new charger and it took several conversations with Amazon to get it resolved. Each time was a different answer. One told me they could do nothing unless I wanted to return the entire purchase for a replacement. I was finally offered a credit to be able to purchase a new charger. I would have been better of going to my mobile provider to get the watch and the support that took a week to resolve here.

  I purchased two of these watches from Amazon.  The first one did not have more than a couple hours of battery life, would get really hot while on the charger, and sometimes would take over a day to charge if it would even charge at all.  I exchanged the first watch for a second one that was the exact same model in the exact same color.  After spending over 11 hours and 3 trips to the VERIZON store, it was discovered that the second watch was not compatible with VERIZON cellular service. VERIZON was not able to get the watch to connect to their service and the store manager deemed the watch defective.  I returned watch to Amazon within 30 day purchase period and was charged an $88 restocking fee!  BUYER BEWARE on this watch and of the HIDDEN RESTOCKING FEE...

  I got the watch because it has a feature where, if you fall and are nonresponsive, it calls 911 and gives your GPS location.  You don't need to activate it to call.  If you are awake after the fall, and don't want to call 911, you tell the watch not to do so. Since I am 70 years old and live alone on a remote farm, that seemed worth the price.  But, it also tracks my activities, brings up text messages, and I can answer the phone when someone calls, without having to drag my phone out of my pocket or backpack.  Wonderful.  Also takes rhythm strip (""EKG""), gives you blood oxygen saturation, and other things that allow a quick checkup if you are feeling puny.  This watch is indispensable.  Oh, and by the way, it is actually pretty.  People have seen it and complimented me on my beautiful watch.  And then I tell them.....

  I wish I was able to use my new Apple Watch but I have no way of charging it because this terrible company sells this watch with an inaccessible charging cable. If you don't have a brand new high end computer with usb-c then you are out of luck. Want to plug your charger into the wall? Too bad, not with this watch. It is completely and utterly unacceptable to sell a product that only the elite few are able to charge. Yes I now see after the fact that it lists it as having usb c but even so, it is ridiculous they provide no way to adapt this into a regular usb or other device that you can plug into the wall.

  I just upgraded from a S3, and to be honest I have a hard time finding the improvements. The screen, because of the rolled edges and the way text kind of rolls off the side, looks strange and gives the impression your using a 3rd party app that wasn’t designed for your system. But you’re not, it’s Apple. The ECG system is honestly the only reason I bought the watch and love that feature. If you don’t need the ECG, stay with the SE or S6 as that one does not utilize the rolled edges.

  The watch has been an interesting investment.  I bought it for several reasons.  I liked the ECG function since I do have a genetic heart valve problem.  The ability to get my heart rate by locking into the gym's treadmill is a great feature.  The one feature that I wanted that the watch does not have is sleep monitoring.  I wanted to know how long I actually slept and how deeply.  The watch either does not have that feature or I have not found it yet.  Not using that feature does allow me to charge the watch overnight.  And, what the heck is it with Apple that they sell you an overpriced watch and then are too cheap to supply a charger.  Get real!

  My 14yr old got his first iPhone for Christmas. I wanted to get him an older Apple Watch (I had the series 4 & was just going to get him that) but they are still so expensive! Spent two days looking online and couldn’t justify it. Came across this one on Amazon and noticed the green one was 338 bucks; sixty bucks cheaper than all the other ones. So I snatched it up for myself and gave my son my series 4 with this green band on it. So far I’m not really noticing much of a difference, and I can’t seem to get the same watch face complication that I had before; that bums me out. The battery life seems to be a slight improvement from my series 4, but there’s still no way to wear it all day and track your sleep too. I charge it overnight. I’m still not sure it was with the upgrade at this point, but I love all the functionality of it. I get Ring doorbell notifications pushed to my watch, Life360, and I love being able to answer calls without pulling out my phone. I’ll be an Apple Watch wearer for life (this my third one).

  Alright, I won’t say the Apple Watch is the best watch in the world because I know not everyone will agree with me but gosh is it really useful. Although this stainless steel version is on the pricier side, it sure is durable with the sapphire glass that’s resistant to scratches and the stainless steel chassis case, more durable than the aluminum version at least. If you’re like me and try to take advantage of all the Apple Watch features, it’s a great buy. If you’re someone who uses smart watches more casually such as for time, messages, notifications, etc. then I would reconsider and maybe think about getting a different smart watch unless you’re willing to learn all the features that are available on it.

The response was immediate, was able to talk on the watch, I explained what happened, operator ask my telephone provider I assume to to verify I was lucid. PERFECT.At first blush this seems to be a nice device full of nice features.The documentation is non existent, you will spend hours researching. There is no connectivity to an iPad only an iPhone.

Not only did the seller have this to me quickly, the shipping packaging was great and the watch came in the original, and unopened packaging. The watch is beautiful and works as expected. I highly recommend this product and seller if you are thinking about getting an iWatch. I bought the Artic Blue in 45mm.

  I liked the watch however Amazon dropped the price $42 less than 5 days after I got it from them. Amazon refused to refund the price difference so I returned it.Battery life was awful even when I removed numerous apps from it and turned off numerous notifications.The watch itself? I also decided I didn’t need that big of an electronic nanny measuring how long I washed my hands, when I needed to take deep breaths, etc so I decided to not buy it at all.Simply not for me.

  The box came with no watch face. My son who is an autistic adult bought this with his hard earned money and was really upset. I returned the item to Amazon the same day on 12/27 and still waiting for a status on his refund.Box came without watch only band and charger for over $400.This will get resolved and going forward I’ll just keep going to Costco or Best Buy for purchases like this.

  We had dinner with a doctor friend and his wife. I saw his Apple watch and asked him about it. He explained the features and I was sold. I was just diagnosed with a-fib and this does heart rate, blood-oxygen levels and an ECG. Amazon had a good price AND all of the accessories that made it easy to wear and use. I bought a velcro band, protective cover, 3 cables, battery backup, etc. It even has a walkie talkie. Who knew? Don't let my wife know, but I am going to buy one for her.

  First, I am a long time user of Mac products but this is my first Apple Watch so I cannot offer comparisons to previous versions. As I am both active and getting older, the emergency fall function seemed practical. It is but, in terms of health monitoring, it offers much more. From ECGs and other heart parameters  to sleep records, fitness records and more, it gives one a definitive record of activity/inactivity, momentum vs inertia. As the AW mirrors much of your iPhone, there is too much to describe.41 vs 45? That is a matter of personal choice. Readability is a frequent question. While I am male, 6 foot and 175lbs, I chose the 41 because it was available and I prefer a smaller piece on my wrist. The screen display is very customizable, it works for me (I attached a photo for reference). The standard sports band is fine but there are many alternatives available.The cellular function? It seemed essential in case I was out of range of my iPhone. After fielding many calls using the AW only, the quality is indistinguishable from my iPhone. Next step is figuring out wireless earbuds 😎. Not to mention little things like haptic alarms, subtle but effective. Battery life could be better but, with high use, it lasts a full day. I charge it when I awaken in the morning and haven’t dipped below 20%.Bottom line? I can’t believe I spent this much on this watch but I’m glad I did. Yes, there are alternative, less pricey choices, I looked at many. I am pleased with the AW7.

  I have had my watch for a week now and can't really say anything bad about it. The battery life is excellent on it, it was very easy to pair with my phone (not sure why others were having such a time doing that). All the features work just as they would on your apple watch. The only thing I keep forgetting is the feature of the ear pods when I answer a call (everyone can hear your phone conversation if you answer with your watch with no pods in). I recommend you get another band if you have any allergies to silicone (that is the type of band that comes with the watch). The more things you add to the watch the more space and battery life that the watch will eat up. Enjoy it.

  I have to admit: this watch has been encouraging me to exercise more and it is fun keeping track of my workouts and walks.  I like the ECG feature, though I have no reason to believe I have a heart problem.But one bummer:  I already have a scratch on the face of the watch.  One of the Apple Watch Series 7 selling points was a more scratch resistant screen.  It seems now like just a marketing ploy.  And I wish the battery was as strong as other smart watches... I find myself recharging before I go to bed so I can track my sleep and use the watch when I wake up and work out.Overall I'm satisfied with the watch, especially since it was on sale!

  The actual watch is good so far aside from not including a charger adapter and having a bit of a learning curve to set up and learn the features, but the pricing on Amazon keeps fluctuating and they will not guarantee the pricing. Even if it changes within a day or two (or sometimes within hours) they'd rather you return the product and likely they will lose money having you ship it back and then having to resell it as used and then have you re-order rather than just reimburse you a few bucks. Kind of takes the excitement out of it. I'll probably just keep mine to avoid the hassle, but beware if the pricing is important to you. Took an exciting experience and just made me sad I bought it.Watch came half charged and died by the time I went to bed, but will see how it goes fully charged.If this is your first Apple Watch you'll probably need to look up a few tutorials, it's somewhat intuitive, but not completely.Just wish I bought it elsewhere.

  I only use some of the features, but the ones I’ve grown used to are fantastic!  Being able to make quick replies to texts is wonderful, and the voice to text works well when I need to go into detail.Some things like the “how long you have been standing” are horribly inaccurate.  Other things like your heart rate are pretty spot on.  My buddy has one and it told him his heart was having issues, he went into the ER and found the watch was right (bad news for him, but at least it was discovered).Checking weather or other functions are convenient, but it’s really a matter of how much you want to load onto your watch.My only real complaint is that the bands are on the small side.  Mine is in the second to last spot, and in hot weather it will be on the last hole.  Apple might want to remember that more than women and children have interest in these.Lastly, this is not a watch I would trust for everyday general wear unless the hardest thing you do is sit at a desk.  Sports, outdoor chores and similar activities would probably kill this thing pretty quick.

  Totally worth it at the 380 discounted price. My last apple watch was a Series 0, -- the first one -- and now we have a bigger screen, great battery life and a bunch of new sensors (EKG, Oxigen, Heartbeat) that make it a non-brainer to buy.Don't get me wrong, I still sport an Omega Speedmaster or a Brietling for high-stakes meetings, however I use the apple watch as my daily driver for everything else.

  I'm no tech nerd, but it literally took me 10 mins to set up. I already have a USB C plug, if you have the latest iPhone or iPad, then you should already have this. If you have the latest phone, then it should already be updated, but if you don't, make sure to update your phone before you get the watch. I had the series 3 which I dropped and cracked after 5 reliable years unfortunately, it will cost me almost as much to fix so I decided to get a new one. Other than a longer battery life and comes on without having to touch it, I don't see much difference in the series 7.

  The best thing about this is the ECG & oxygen saturation which is temperamental and only works some of the time fyi. It’s a lot of money for the convenience of having your phone on your wrist which is pretty much what it is. Friends have the cellular version (mine is only gps) and they think it’s “life changing”. I can still talk on mine as long as my phone is around (across the room & upstairs it still works.) I haven’t been able to figure out the sleep tracking. Upgraded from Fitbit and gotta say their sleep tracking is superior in ease of use and results & only cost $69.( That also had heart rate tracking. ) if you work where you can’t use a phone I can see the work around of still having your phone but not. It’s a lot of money to skirt around the No phone rule. Maybe I’m just old school & am used to not looking at my phone every second of every day. My review is “meh”. I won’t return it but I can see living with out it. Maybe that will change with time.

  As a long-time Apple Watch user, I initially thought that the Series 7 was not worth upgrading to. After all, my trusty Series 4 had many of the same features (delivering notifications silently on my wrist, sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, and an EKG party-trick ability that I rarely use but is cool to have I guess) and was more than adequate enough for my use case. However, my Series 4's battery life was waning, and I was itching to move on from a rose gold watch, so when I saw that the price of this particular Series 7 variation dropped to $379, I knew I could afford to pull the trigger. Compared to my Series 4, this watch has many iterative improvements, including an always-on display, slightly larger screen, and a blood oxygen sensor, that when taken as a whole, make me a happy customer. The midnight color is definitely better-looking in person as well! If you're an existing Apple Watch user and have an older model, then this is an upgrade worth considering. If you're looking to get into the smartwatch world and have an iPhone, then this could be a good starter smartwatch for you.

  The Apple Watch itself is great and as advertised. But I would order from another site. I tried using Amazon's 12 month equal pay option, but they ended up still charging the full amount without notifying me of any changes. Despite using an Amazon card, it took 2 emails, 10 minutes of online chat, and then 20 minutes on the phone to get the billing rectified. Customers shouldn't have to spend an hour of their time to resolve a billing issue on the seller's side, much less when it's the seller's credit card being used. Not the best look for such an established company. The month delay in shipping due to the supply chain issues is understandable, the effort on resolving issues that are in Amazon's control, is not.

  I absolutely hated that this did not come with a charger. Now I am stuck home with Covid for Christmas and I have a useless Apple Watch that I cannot charge. To add insult to injury the correctApple chargers Cost a minimum of $30 and are not available on Amazon for over two weeks. So now I have a Watch that I cannot use and I cannot go out and get a charger. Apple sucks to package their watch in an unusable state. At the very least a small adapter should come in the original package. Gave battery life accuracy and mobile app all bad reviews because they cannot be used without a charge.

  There's no secret, as new smartwatches keep joining the battle, it's still Apple who keeps winning the race. Workout tracking, steps, heart rate, ECG, blood oxigen, unlocking your iPhone and Mac without Face ID or passcode, Apple Pay, notifications for all apps on your wrist, etc. It's a very cool gadget to have, very useful and very functional.To me, the only down side is still the battery. There are other smartwatches that beat the Apple Watch big time on battery, so it makes you wonder what does Apple need to create a watch with a battery that lasts as least a couple of days.Aside from the battery, which to me only represents the hastle of putting the watch on the charger for about an hour (The charging is super fast now), there's nothing else to complain about.

  I love everything about this watch! It charges quickly and the battery life is good. Like other rechargeable devices the more you do with it the faster it goes down. Since it charges so quickly that’s no big deal. I didn’t like the band because it’s too sweaty in in the summer. I think I should have gotten the one with cellular because this one has to be near my phone to do some things. Another piece of advice I have for others is to get an adapter when you get your watch so you can charge it. I couldn’t set mine up until the adapter came.

  I have loved my Apple Watch 3 for the past 3 years but love my new 7 even more. More screen area makes my pictures on the watch face bigger and clearer.  Choosing numbers and Apps is much easier with this size advantage. As someone conscious of COVID hazards, I find having the oximeter App built in has me checking my blood O2 every day vs a few times a week. I also like the built in EKG.

  Sleeker, better connected, more efficiently charged, faster, more intuitively organized and managed than ever before. The single greatest advance among my repertoire of uses is its connectivity with messaging—I just don't miss messages anymore; of course, I can put them off or ignore them whenever that's best but even that is more easily handled. And next is the music I can now store on it, which is easily accomplished and saves me taking my phone to the gym where I was forever misplacing it. And next is the improvement in ease and accuracy of the ECG recording of heart rhythm; I'm nearly 80, so knowing I am or am not in atrial fibrillation is important to me on occasion, which does not come up for me everyday, but when it does I want the watch to work, to do its thing; and now it does. I am grateful. I could go on (and on), but I won't. If you have need, and means, buy it.

  Purchased the device for the purposes 1) to track sleep and 2) to avoid missing notifications when the phone is away.Good:- looks nice- charges fast (you go to shower, get back - fully charged, but you need to use only the original charger)- notifications are delivered effectively, with images- Apple Pay works- like other Apple products, has ""find me"" featureBad:- heavy, especially if you plan to sleep with it on- have to recharge every 24 hours;- sleep tracking is weak because you must pre-configure sleep time range (i.e. 9pm-6am) in the app; otherwise feature does not work; if you take a nap during the day, it will not be counted; if you have an unstable sleeping schedule and need to rely on the device with tracking your sleep - better use Fitbit- backward communication from the watch to iPhone, say, when you confirm a request in Authenticator app, works unstablySummary:A very stylish gadget with convenient one-way access to notifications and simple built-in functions.

  This is my first Apple Watch and I’m loving it! I bought it for the fall detector because I’m epileptic and live alone, so it gives me some relief. Hopefully I never have to find out the hard way that it doesn’t work. My only problems so far is just the talk to text. There’s no way to SEND a message, or put punctuation completely hands free. Plus the send/back buttons on the top are a bit finicky. If you have the watch in a frame forget about it. Also, I know it says it’s waterproof, but it clearly states soaps and such might deteriorate the seals over time. So I can’t wear it in the shower, where I as an epileptic need to wear it most.

  I upgraded from a second-generation model to this one. I dislike that you have to pay so much more to get one with the Milanese loop band and have to get a cellular model to get the dark color.

  I now own the Apple Watch 7stainless steel, you’ll get a much harder casing material and display. Sapphire crystal is one of the hardest opaque materials in the world. It has been used in high-end conventional watches for decades and can only be scratched by a diamond or an object with similar hardness. In practice, with a sapphire crystal display, your Apple Watch Series 7 will most likely remain scratch-free until it’s time for a new one, and even after that.

  I considered buying a used apple watch a couple years ago, because the current watch at the time didn't seem to do much more than the older watches. Then the 7 was going to come out with always on feature, and larger screen, which for me was the thing I wanted. I'm so far loving it. The ability to switch between always on faces means it can go from looking like an elegent watch (plain, artistic face) to utilitarian with a swipe. The added health features are a bonus. Although I don't really need them, I could see those features being very handy for an older user that's trying to monitor changes to heart rate, O2 saturation, etc.

  Bought the green series 7. You can barely tell that it’s green if you change the strap. You have to know it’s green or be looking for it in the right light. Could easily pass for a black or dark charcoal. The image quality is great for such a small screen. The swipe keyboard is useable, but voice to text still reigns supreme for convenience. Not sure I would have upgraded from an older version like the SE or 6. Very glad to get the 7 since coming from a Fitbit.

  We have been Android users for 15+ years and decided to give Apple a try with the new 13 Pro Max release.  We both have those phones now and decided we should give the watch a try.  Amazing integration.  My wife loves the Walkie Talkie function, and she is able to keep up on her Teams notifications.  I myself use a watch more for a watch and really like the customization options available.  Seems to be well built, well thought out, and comfortable to wear.

  I really wanted one of these watches since all of my clients had them and loved them. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and the whole reason I mainly bought it- fitness tracking is constantly inaccurate. Anytime I do a work out with my peloton 50% or more of the data is missing. I’ve tried to troubleshoot the app several times as recommended by removing and redownloading and reconfiguring and nothing works. Also when I go to record a walk outside it just stops abruptly after about two minutes every single time. Doesn’t matter if my wrist is up down to the side it just does not register the work out. I wish I would’ve saved this box I would’ve completely returned it. Super disappointed.

  I have had multiple fitbits in the past.  I finally broke down and purchased the new series 7 Apple Watch.  I love the look and all the features.  It did take a little time to get setup.  I had to install a new update in my iPhone before I could setup the Watch.  It works great and has some really nice features.  The only flaw I found so far is with charging.  I was disappointed to find that the Watch came with a USB-c charger cord only with no plug for the wall outlet.  I had to plug the cord into my computer to charge.

  This is my third Apple Watch. I guess I'm a sucker for Apple stuff. The watch works great. They added some heat apps that interested me. I use it everyday to track my sleep, my exercise, & heart rate.

  Fast set up, had to upgrade my phone but that was no problem. Took about 40 minutes, bought the USB C charger after reading the reviews but luckily my iMac at work had the connection so I charged it on that until I received the charger. With Verizon I connected the cellular in about 10 minutes through the app. $30 activation fee and $10 a month. The watch is in great condition, I also ordered a case to keep it protected. I’m really happy with my order! I also Afterpay’d this and I’m onto my 2nd payment. 5 star experience fast shipping and battery life last long when you turn off the “always on” option.

  My wife had the older generation Watch and works for her but once I saw that the ECG and blood oxygen features with this series I knew I wanted this to monitor my health better for this year. I mainly use it for keeping a routine to go for daily walks, exercise and be more active and keep closer tabs on my heart rate. Islts water proof and pair these features with the fitness app to share your activity with your friends or family and that gives me the motivation to keep pushing it. I love it so far

  I have a series 4 and have never felt the need to upgrade, as my battery life still lasts me nearly two days. It hasn't been slowed down by any software updates, and still works fine. I finally decided to upgrade to the series 7 for the larger, always-on screen and blood oxygen sensor. It is definitely not worth it. I don't know if it's due to the always-on screen or what, but the battery life of this new series 7 is far worse than on my 3+ year-old series 4 watch. When I take the watch off, it only has ~35% battery left at the end of the day, and that is with barely any use (whereas my series 4 can still end the day with over 50% battery left). I imagine if I had any workouts or used many apps on the watch during the couple of weeks of owning the watch, it would have died before the end of the day. Also, the blood oxygen only seems to work about half the time, and the readings are all over the place. Again, I upgraded to have the always-on display, but that's pointless if I have to disable it to get decent battery life.

  There are several glitches in the watch.  First i don’t know why you would monitor you sleep unless you want to take the watch off in the morning to charge it. Batter life is only a 30hours. So it does half way through the day. The heath monitoring is constantly glitches.  It doesn’t count your workouts towards your daily goal unless you recalibrate regularly.  You only get to monitor you cardiac fitness once.  Even with recalibration. To get rid of the unnecessary apple apps on the watch you have to delete them off the iPhone. Recommend waiting for another generation or two.

  The older I get the more I rely on my Apple Watch to track all my health issues so when I go to the Doctor I have a good report of my body to present to him. I can pull my activity counts, average heartrate, run an EKG and more. It even tells him how much I am hydrating. If I take a fall the watch detects and asks if it should call for help, it tells me when I have been watching my televised story programs too long and need to stand up and move, and also tracks how well I am sleeping. The bigger screen on this model is also helpful to my failing eyes.

The plastic seal is nonexistent and the box is opened on one side.Now I’m expected to go without the watch I paid for, by returning my first one along with the replacement one, then wait for a refund, then purchase another one, then pray that it’s actually new still wrapped in Apple’s plastic seal, then wait for that to arrive still.

  The watch is very nice.  Alert: you MUST have your iPhone at iOS 15.1 in order to pair the series 7 watch.  Also the charger must have the USB-C version, which you must buy separately in order to charge the watch.  It does not come with the watch, order separately because the watch must be full charge for an update. It comes without the most recent update.  I spent 2 hours trying to pair, then talked to Apple Support, that could not help.  Then I read another review to find out it needed iOS 15.1 on the phone.

  I previously had a Fitbit and loved it. Decided to upgrade to an Apple Watch. Was very upset to open the box and not find a charging cube.

For the cost of the series 7, Apple should include the cubes or at least an adapter. Battery life is terrible. Only 18-24 hrs. Hard to track sleeping when you have to charge so often.

  It’s a great little gadget and I bet I will get even more use out of it as I become more active. I love the Astronomy watch face of the Earth. I do wish the default wristband was better attached though. I had to buy myself an after market band because the one it came with didn’t attach very securely and there were times where I unclipped it from my wrist and it fell to the floor. Luckily no damage. But for ~ ~$400 Watch you’d think it would be more secure.

  I'm not here to review the actual watch yet, as this is a graduation gift for my daughter who graduates from college in May, but I was concerned by the way the outside packaging looked (like it had been opened), so I had to immediately open it myself to check to see if everything was present.Luckily everything on the inside was actually sealed. Hopefully, it will all work out great for her once she receives it.

  Love the Series 7 Apple Watch's functions.  Everything is top notch as expected.  The one caveat I have is that if you cannot read close up without reading glasses, it will be inconvenient to constantly take off and put on readers to see the screen.  That stated, the GPS, email, messaging, calendar, fitness tracking, speaker, and other features are a great benefit to have on your wrist without having to pull out the iPhone.

  Every feature of this watch is spot on!  Purchased for emergency SOS, and for GPS location should I fall or otherwise need help.  I love the gold stainless case and the ability to have a cellular connectivity as well as pair with my iPhone.  I have had another apple watch (aluminum case) and liked it very much, but wanted a gold stainless case, thus the reason for buying this one.  Re: SOS feature...  I fell recently and the watch was faster at responding than my fall alert button for which I pay a monthly fee.The reason I gave the watch a 4 star review is because I thought I was purchasing a NEW watch, but in fact when it came and I placed it on the charger, it became very hot and I realized the battery must be bad.  So, I investigated further and found out it was a refurbished watch (good condition).  Am giving a 4 star review only because I am returning the watch due to battery heating up when on charge.  I will purchase another apple watch... NEW this time.

  This is my first piece of wearable tech. I chose the Apple Watch because I'm an iPhone user and have faith in Apple products due to their simplicity, aesthetics, cutting edge technology, durability, product support, and overall value. So far this watch has lived up to all my expectations.In terms of feature benefits, my main interest are the heart health functions including the Mindfulness/Breath app. The fall detection also seems like good insurance; it will automatically contact 911 in the event of a hard fall.Beyond that, the watch itself is beautiful as a watch, and very convenient from a communication perspective.Amazon's pricing and delivery were great.

  It’s an Apple Watch, you know what you’re getting. The midnight color in person looks much darker than the photos or marketing materials. It looks matte black in basically every situation other than direct sunlight hitting it at just the right angle, then you can see this faint tinge of dark metallic blue.

  I love this watch when I am working out, I can track my heart rate, blood oxygen, ECG, time spend on each exercise, etc. I am getting more use out of it in my day-to-day than I ever thought I would. The only real downside is the battery life. When using all the features you need to charge it once a day minimally and it takes an hour and a half or so to charge which isn't horrible but I wish I had a little more time between charges.

  The apples watch has a great set of features, integration with apps, and level of control on notifications which is something I noticed missing on other watches I had tried. Ability to unlock your iPhone which is great if you are wearing a mask these days. Also the apple pay is nice bonus. Best Smartwatch I have tried to date.Biggest draw backs: Short battery life (plan to charge it daily) and No Temperature sensor

  My watch is fine. Works as it’s designed. It was Xmas gift to myself.  I had a cheaper watch before that I charged every 3 days. I have to realize this does more so I have to charge it about every 20-30 hrs. What I’m grateful for was reading the reviews that told me I needed a usb-c charging block so I ordered that with the watch.

  Watch is an actual Apple watch (I did not know I could purchase Apple products on Amazon!). Works great, as with many newer Apple products does not include much instruction on watch use ; need the app ( or you tube videos or a 22 year old ) to figure out most functions. Unhappy that it came with charging cord but no wall adapter; needs a Usb-c adapter. Overall happy with purchase

  The watch is sleek, beautiful, very responsive and works wonders when filled with juice - but that's the thing, Battery barely lasts 24 hours. Ex - I charged yesterday at 7 PM, didn't use for anything else but to watch the time, my sleep track if actually off so it is not like the watch is working extra during the night. RN is Noon and I have 46% Battery and still have 7 hours to go for the full 24 hrs. So yeah, very disappointed with the Battery Life. My coworker have a Series 5 and he told me it lasts 2 days, no problem.  So I am really bummed on this regard.

  I thought watches were outdated until I bought a fit bit for fitness tracking in less than a year my desire grew for more fitness data and I added swimming to my routine. I bought an Apple Watch  series 3 exactly 3 years ago. Loved it, passed it onto my daughter and upgraded to the 7 series. I absolutely love these watches. The 7 is easier to use, if that’s even possible and the battery life is much much better than my 3. If you’re a first time buyer or looking to upgrade I highly suggest this one!

  All I can say it's really disappointing to buy and item like this and you can't use it because there is no way to charge it. Now imagine getting it as a gift and having to wait to use it until you buy another item (the power block) to charge it. That's like buying a TV without a power cord, or a new car that doesn't come with the FOB or key. I never liked Apple products because of the hassle, this just solidifies my belief that APPLE SUCKS.

  I paid a lot of money for this watch. It was packaged very nicely but it does not come with a charging cube to insert into the outlet. I have an Apple watch and cubes and none would work.

My son-in-law came over and thought it could be charged on my computer but it could not. So, he has now ordered me another type of cube from Best Buy and hope this works.

  Bought this for my mom for Christmas. After having it for 3 weeks it stopped fully charging, would only go up to 60% tops. Went to the order on Amazon and followed the recommendations. Now won’t go over 30%. Have bought a new charger and charging block and still nothing. Was not damaged in anyway, not taken under water NOTHING just stopped working. Oh and the Amazon return window is closed so I totally got screwed over on this expensive gift that is now basically useless. DO NOT BUY FROM HERE

  I have no idea if I will like it or not. My first Apple watch and I live in a small town with not many places to shop and you don't include a $10.00 charging plug when I pay $800 for an apple watch. The end won't fit in any of my charges. You really should disclose when I ordered or send me a free one. One would assume for that kind of money I would be able to charge it without having to search to find a plug.

  Along with the watch itself they give you the charging cable, but no adapter to plug it into. So. You’re given the watch and no way to charge it. And it’s not a USB plug, it’s something completely specific to the series 7. Maybe this is something you need to include, instead of forcing me to buy something separately to keep the damn thing functioning. Now I have to wait for the adapter, so if it dies until then, oh well. That’s completely ridiculous.

  Not even close to performance of a FitBit. Battery doesn’t last a full day even with always on turned off. (Mine may be defective) Sleep tracking gives a total, but no detail. Mode has to be manually changed for an outdoor walk. Apps on the whole work really well with the iPhone, but in my case, the FitBit does just as well for a lot less money and it holds a charge for 4-5 days.

  Haven’t even had it’s month and the battery is already going extremely quick. I thought it was going rather quick from the beginning and I guess I was right because now it won’t even last a day. It is also starting to freeze up on certain screens and if it’s already starting to do that, there’s more and worse to come. I will be retuning it.

  It took half a day to set up.  I had to leave it with my iPhone within range of WiFi and connected to chargers while I downloaded a long series of updates and performed a long series of restarts.The battery life is about 18 hours so I need to take it off to charge while I sleep.  This makes it difficult to use as a sleep monitor and use it as a watch all day.The watch isn’t very useful without being always linked to my iPhone.  Now I have to have  Bluetooth on my iPhone always on which sucks battery life. Also, the watch/iPhone combo made the decision for me that my iPhone alerts are now silent and the watch will tap my wrist for alerts.  After missing a couple appointments I had to disconnect the watch by turning off Bluetooth.  I searched through the hundreds of settings and couldn’t find the one where I gave permission to make decisions about iPhone settings without my consents.Apple doesn’t include power supplies anymore and they switched all there power cords to a new connector so I can’t use the 10 old power supplies I have sitting in a drawer.  Seems like a cash grab.  I guess they are out of ideas for new useful products that would increase sales.

  Everyone that is complaining about the ""surprise"" usb-c charging cable, you need to actually read before you buy. It clearly states in the item description what type of charging cable it comes with. Dont give the 1 star reviews over your own neglect of reading what you are getting. Those that had a hard time setting up the watch also  need to do the same. Do some research, and find out if your current firmware is what is needed to run the watch you are purchasing. So many people just leave negative comments when the item is great, but their lack of doing any reading, or research is their own fault. This is a GREAT WATCH PERIOD!

  Okay, I've been an Android fan since, well, since the very beginning...I still am if I'm being honest. I have also spent a ridiculously large amount of $$ on smart watches over the years starting with the original Moto 360 (anyone remember that flat tire?). It LOOKED cool, especially that round face, but performance-wise, well, it was kinda terrible. The battery life was insultingly horrible (it would lose 7% in the ten minute drive to work while just sitting on my wrist doing nothing). But the potential was there. In finally switched to Samsung's Tizen at the introduction of the Gear S2. What a great watch that was. I went on to the Gear S3, the Gear Sport, the Galaxy Watch, the GW3 and then I heard the news: Samsung was going back to Wear OS. This disappointed me greatly. Over the years I have owned well over a dozen watches utilizing Wear OS (or Android Wear before that) and while I loved a lot about many of them, they ALL suffered from the stuttering and glitching that plagues essentially ALL Wear OS devices. Some have managed to work around that to produce the best version they possibly can (TicWatch Pro 3 and the Oppo Watch are just 2 examples) but each had at least something that just didn't work properly - and I don't blame either manufacturer for this. It's an ongoing problem with Wear OS itself. Slowly, I began to warm to the idea that maybe, just MAYBE Samsung will make it work the way it was always supposed to work. So, I bought the Galaxy Watch 4.Did Samsung fix Wear OS? In a word: NO. It still suffers from glitches, hiccups and stuttering and apps not opening properly and/or timely. At times it works just great (which is more often than not, but still...), I have a fairly expensive watch that ruins what otherwise ought to be a smoother experience than what I'm getting. My Galaxy Watch 3 runs fantastic (it runs on TIzen software and not Wear OS) and honestly, I have had zero issues with it since I got it over a year ago, nor any with my previous Tizen watches including the Gear S2, S3, Gear Sport and original Galaxy Watch. I have had intermittent issues with the GW4 since the day I brought it home. To be fair, I have heard many people who claim that their Watch 4's have run flawlessly since they bought theirs...but I cannot speak to their experience, only the one I've had - but I brought it up to be fair.I have done a LOT of research regarding all different kinds of smart watches, and you know what you almost never hear from the majority of apple watch owners? You don't hear about not getting a notification, or stuttering and glitches here and there. Sure, I'm sure they exist, but the overwhelming majority generally say the same thing: the watch JUST WORKS. Honestly, that is all I really care about. Does it do what it claims and does it do it consistently? From an Android Fanboy, I can say this without reservation: the apple watch works and does so CONSISTENTLY. I simply cannot say that about my GW4 or any other Wear OS device I have used over the last 6-8 years.Okay, now why did I switch? Well, when I heard that the apple watch could be used without an iPhone, it really caught my attention. Seriously, an apple watch that can be set up so the user does not need an iPhone?? Well that's just what I wanted to hear. The truth is, once the watch is set up with ""Family Setup"" as long as it's an LTE model watch, you do not need to have it paired with an iPhone AT ALL...however (and this is a biggie) - you STILL need an iPhone to set it up initially. That sucked. But - I have enough friends with iPhone's that I took the plunge anyway.The watch looks phenomenal BTW. I got the blue model and that new watch face that takes advantage of the larger screen is fantastic. Since this is my very first apple watch, I can't speak to how well it compares to earlier models, so I'm sorry about that. Honestly however, having not used a previous model before, I just don't see that there is a difference that is noticeable when compared to my friends who have earlier model apple watches. The major thing I like is exactly what I wanted most: a watch that is reliable. It took a bit of getting used to because I have been so familiar with Wear OS and Tizen watches for so long, but it isn't difficult, just takes a little time, that's all. I haven't always liked the apple rectangular shape...but slowly, it grew on me. It was always made really well, of that there has never been any doubt, but the series 7 is just great to look at.The one thing keeping my review from 5 to only 4 stars was the pretty HUGE omission of the charging block. As you've no doubt gathered by now, I'm a android guy and always have been. My last 4 phones have all used USB-C chargers...but none of them came with blocks that the USB-C cord went into, they all had the USB-C port on only ONE end, not both. It's fair to assume the majority of apple users do not own one of these, either. Meaning, it's an unnecessary EXTRA expense you absolutely MUST make in order to even be able to use your watch - unless you have a charger from a previous apple watch which you can still use, but you won't be able to take advantage of the faster charging time. For what apple is charging for this watch, leaving this out is nothing shy of a ginormous cash grab on their part, and it's rather blatant and disappointing. Seriously guys, this is simple greed...and if anyone at their HQ bothers to read any of these reviews will note that there are quite a few upset genuine apple fanatics who really are quite upset by this same situation, so I am definitely NOT alone here. Wise up apple or you'll force longtime fans into the arms of Wear OS simply to make a statement.With that said, the watch operates extraordinarily well. I have seen zero hiccups that I see each time I turned on my Galaxy Watch 4 (seriously, EVERY time I turn it on, I get a notification that tells me I have voice mail, but when I check, there is nothing there - literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I turn the watch on. After 3 months...it got old...and now it simply makes me mad). I've always heard of the great haptics on apple devices and now I know what they mean. Samsung does a pretty good job as well on their watches, don't get me wrong, but these are just, well, better. It's hard to describe unless you've actually worn one to feel the difference. My TicWatch Pro 3 is actually a pretty good Wear OS watch, it really is...however, the haptics are so friggin' anemic I miss 90% of my notification vibrations due to the poor haptic engine it has. (this is an issue with hundreds of thousands of other TicWatch Pro 3 owners...it's on many online threads if you're curious) That isn't the case here with the series 7. I get ALL my notifications and in a timely manner and that on-screen keyboard with swipe-like ability is fantastic. It's not as good as the Google keyboard, but it isn't far behind...and for quick text input, especially if you're in a loud environment where you cannot use voice dictation, or you're in a quiet place or you simply don't want people around you to hear what you're replying, this is a wonderful tool and it works pretty great. Kudos to apple for adding it. I want to mention the haptic engine again...it's actually quite impressive. It vibrates in a totally different manner than ALL other smart watches I've ever owned. It works beautifully and it is hard to miss a notification due to it's efficiency. I swear, if my TicWatch had a decent haptic engine and better music-transfer capability, I may never have even considered getting the apple watch at all.This the only smartwatch besides Samsung to make transferring music to your watch pretty seamless. OR SO I THOUGHT. I tried almost a dozen different programs supposedly designed to help convert my mp3's to easily transfer to my phone and then onto my watch. Almost every one would cap you at transferring 10 songs per day ONLY - unless you paid money. Even iTunes was a problem saying that I had to change this setting on my phone in order to transfer music...yet no matter how often I changed the setting, it still said I needed to do the same thing again. I deleted iTunes and re-downloaded it and tried again. Nope. Same issue. I finally discovered a program called, ""SynciOS"" which allowed me to transfer music in a pretty intuitive manner and do it ridiculously quick. Not sure why it took so long to be able to do something so simple, but sheesh, this was essentially the only thing that really frustrated me regarding my series 7 watch. Samsung makes this process STUPID EASY to do and sorry apple fans, is FAR SUPERIOR to how apple does it. All other Wear OS watches are no better at making this an easy process and in fact, can make it even more difficult.I love how on my hikes, while listening to music on my watch, I'll get updates every mile I've reached. This is another great feature...but its one that is done better with the Galaxy Watches. The Original GW and the GW3 and GW4 all give you this same information but goes a few steps further. Samsung tells you when you've reached that mile, but also tells you how many steps you've taken to get there AND your heart rate. It only takes 3-4 extra seconds and it works great. The difference between Tizen and Wear OS however is that with TIzen the music would halt while the watch reads out that info thru the bluetooth earbuds, while Wear OS it just slightly lowers the volume of music and tells you the information. Apple lowers the music volume much lower which makes hearing your metrics much easier, but still, the more information the better as far as I'm concerned. Yesterday I wore both my GW3 and the apple watch and they each marked every mile within probably 4-5 seconds of one another - or roughly 15-20 feet difference, which says they both were pretty spot-on for how they measured distance. They both were within about 7 steps of each other as well and heart rate were off by 1 or 2 beats per minute. That tells me either they are both accurate, or both are off by roughly the same amount. There may be a few workout routines that apple doesn't cover which Samsung does and vice versa, but they do all the one's I personally use regularly and that's what counts as far as I'm concerned. Great implementation, too.All in all, you've made this Android user a convert. Though, I still prefer using my Samsung phone. Sorry guys.***UPDATE***Battery life compared to my GW4 is simply astonishing - especially considering how much people whine about it online. Case in point: yesterday I braved the snow and 15 degree temps and walked the 5 miles home from work for my exercise. I wore both my Galaxy Watch 4 and apple watch 7. Keep in mind before I left, I topped off my GW4 til it was at 100%, something I could not do with my apple watch since I do not have a spare charger at work like I do with my Samsung watches, which seem to need it more often. I will stipulate that after a few weeks using my GW4 the battery life improved significantly as it ""learned"" my habits and adjusted accordingly. I used GPS on both to keep track of my walk, and listened to music downloaded to both watches and switched from one to the other exactly at the half-way point to make it fair. By the time I reached home, my GW4 was down to 61%. Now keep in mind I had been using my apple watch since 5am that morning and wasn't able to charge it before leaving for home. When I hit home my apple watch 7 was still at 79%. That is astonishing to me...and an enormously HUGE difference. I have suspected the battery life was better, but not by THAT much. I just looked it up, and the 45mm apple Watch 7 has a battery size of 309 mAh, while the GW4 has a battery size of 361 mAh. Sorry, but this is a GINORMOUS apple win here. It seems every other review I read about the newest apple watch, one of the chief complaints is battery life, but when compared to the GW4, I cannot help but be happy with it's performance so far. After having used the apple watch for over a week, using the GW4 reminded me (again) that Wear OS just isn't quite there yet. The crazy glitches that plague this system, the incessant notification of voicemail that is NEVER there 100% of the time whenever I turn the watch off and turn it back on again, the notification that my watch is playing media that isn't there, or that it's paired with a kindle that I have never paired it with, the slowness of opening apps and closing them again, the problem of pulling down the settings menu and how it works about half the time I try to pull it down, or scroll up working only part of the time, or how I close all apps only to discover some still open - apps I've never tried to open since the day I bought my watch...the list goes on and on. You know what glitches I've had with the apple watch? NONE. Seriously. I haven't had one single hiccup since I turned this device on. I truly wished this were not the case with my Samsung. The honest truth is I wouldn't even have an apple watch were it not for my sour experience with the newest Galaxy Watch. I still hope that a future update will correct most of these problems, and if so, I will be thrilled to see them implemented and will gladly state so. Problem is, I don't think this is Samsung's problem, it's an issue with Wear OS and Samsung can only do so much to correct it. I DO find it interesting that my older TicWatch Pro 3 has shown far fewer issues and glitches than the GW4 in pretty much every situation...so maybe its a combination of Wear OS and Samsung's version of Wear OS 3.0. Either way, I've been very disappointed in my experience and wish that they had never switched from Tizen in the first place. Oh well. Time will tell if Wear OS can correct these issues or not.The body composition feature is cool on the GW4. I really thought it would be more useful, though. I suppose it can be, but - for me at least - it simply hasn't been something that I've been able to get any kind of genuine use out of. Reportedly it can actually measure your blood pressure...but on a watch? I honestly cannot see how accurate that could be using any kind of method the way the watch is set up. Every reputable medical site I have looked at says the tech is far too new and simply isn't capable - yet anyway - of accurately being able to measure blood pressure monitoring. Kudos to Samsung for initiating it, but at this point, I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock on accuracy.Charging...so, since this is my first apple watch, I can't compare it's supposedly 33% faster charging over previous models...but I WILL say it's faster than the Galaxy Watch 4, 3, Original Galaxy Watch etc. and my TicWatch Pro 3...however, I have an Oppo Watch (which was clearly a ripoff of the apple watch design, but in their defense, they did a STELLAR job with it), now that watch charges FAST. Exactly how much faster, I cannot say for certain, but let's just say all of those other models I mentioned pale in comparison. I just find it absurd that apple did not include a charging block. An utterly imbecilic decision.

  Unpacking is a bit difficult, but not too bad. This is typical for Apple's super fancy packaging. Attaching the watch band is very easy and obvious. Next comes the pairing with your iPhone. This is not so easy or obvious but works quite well as long as you know your iPhone passcode and put the watch on top of your iPhone face down as suggested by the pairing software. Once synced with your iPhone you will be prompted to set a passcode for the watch. Do set it, but not until you have finished the total setup. Your watch now contains a lot of personal information that you should protect. When you take your watch off your wrist, the passcode request comes on very quickly, so if you want to work on your watch with it off your wrist, temporarily turn the passcode off from the settings icon. There are a couple of things you should do immediately in the settings mode. First, is to put all the icons in a list instead of the cute scattering of icons in the default mode. Second, is to swipe up from the bottom and put the watch in theater mode. This makes the watch silent except for haptic vibrations and turns the screen off (hugely increasing battery life, in my case, more than doubling the stated 18 hours). Two taps on the screen turns the screen back on for a short period. You can use your nose to turn on the screen if your other hand is occupied (your chin will not work). I am now sure you can receive and make phone calls in this mode. Holding down the side button will activate Alexa and allow voice commands such as ""Call John Smith"". After these two, use the U-Tube videos or the online watch manuals to further customize the watch.There are lots of entertainment features built into the watch and into your iPhone and plenty of apps to download if you feel the need.The biggest built-in is health monitoring if you feel the need to know your vitals (heart rate, oxygen levels etc.). Under health monitoring is fall detection. This could save your life and is one of the best reasons to own an Apple watch series 7 whether you are young or old.Why 4-stars instead of 5? It is all about the passcode when the watch is off your wrist. There needs to be a timer on the passcode so that it can be delayed for a few minutes or longer while you work on the watch's settings. As it is right now, you have to manually turn the passcode off while it is on your wrist and then remember to turn it back on in order to work on the settings off of your wrist.I highly recommend purchasing a screen protector, since this fairly large watch can bump into things and scratch the screen. It is much easier to replace a $2 screen protector (clear plastic covering) than it is to repair the screen.There is an interesting small battery-operated recharger for the watch that could be useful if you use the watch a lot while away from home or away from A/C power (in a car or plane) . Lopnord Wireless Charger for Apple Watch. It is so small that it fits in your pocket or purse and can recharge the watch at least one to one and a half times. I've got one and will review it separately and come back to this review when I am confident that it works well. It works very well and can be used by itself or when plugged into a USB port for recharging.

  As already posted in previous reviews, this watch doesn’t come with the usb c brick that you need to charge it, so buy yourself one when you order your new watch. I already had one because I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro. That and the shorter battery life of this watch are the only drawbacks. You’re going to have to charge this watch every 24 hours. That being said, it’s a wonderful watch. It came in sealed, Apple packaging. The watch box was sealed on both ends. I mention this because of a few other reviews that complain of unsealed packaging and missing items. It has many features and I love that the health app integrates with the watch and you can view all of the data collected by the watch there. I ordered and received the 41mm. I’m a woman and I find that an adequate size for my wrist and I’m actually glad that I didn’t get the 45mm because it would have been too big and I’m not a dainty female with a small wrist. It has a lot of apps available and I took about a third of them off and that made the ones I wanted easier to view. It has a lot of watch faces to choose from and there are watch face apps available as well. I would have preferred a different color but with all of the watch bands available to choose from and different colors of hard screen protectors out there, it really didn’t matter and it’s a great price. I did purchase the offered insurance for $79 as well. All in all, it’s a great watch. The last comment I’d make is that something as basic as a wall charger that’s required to charge the product that you’ve just spent several hundred $$ on, should include it. Are you listening Apple? Probably not, oh well.

  Hello. I’ve been eying the Series 7 for awhile as I had a Series 5 for a year and a half so I finally upgraded. I enjoy the slightly bigger screen, and brighter dispay along with better charging speeds and being able to use my old case and bands is a big plus in my book. To me it’s not much of an upgrade but you’re coming from a Series 3 and below then the upgrades will be major. People that complain about not having a charging brick in the box need to read the description as the description clearly says it doesn’t come with one so why complain about something that you should’ve known from the get go? They should do better research on what they buy next time and plus if you bought a new smart phone or even tablet within the last few years you should have a spare USB C charging brick laying around if not just suck it up and buy one Apple doesn’t include one so it can save on waste and declutters their packaging. The USB C Apple Watch cable allows the Series 7 to charge faster so I rather have a cable that allows me to charge my watch faster just in case if I forget to charge my watch or if I’m having a jam packed day ahead of me and need to charge it as much as I can so I can either get my day started or continue my day.

  This is my first Apple Watch. I bought it from Apple and I love it. Still learning all it has to offer. I am disappointed, however, in the display. This series is touted to be more rugged than previous series. I am not that rough and, after less than 2 months, I already have 2 large scratches (see picture). At first I had a plastic film on it, but once I got active, moisture accumulated underneath. There are/were no covers available, plus I didn’t want to add bulk to the already large display. Of course the warranty doesn’t cover this. Eventually I will use my AppleCare+ to replace it. :(

  I have given this a lower rating of 2 because of Apple's stupidity. The watch itself is fine and should be rated higher. However, on the 7-series and on the latest iPad's, Apple has changed the charging cord on both ends. Both the insert connector to the power source and the connector to the watch (iPad) are different from previous versions and are not compatible with previous chargers. The power source can no longer be a USB port as the connector doesn't fit. And old charging cords cannot be used as they don't fit the iWatch or the iPad. This means you have to have double sets of chargers around, including automobile charges It is very annoying and irritating. Why did Apple do this?In addition, I unplug the charger from my iPad at my own peril. When I reconnect it it doesn't always start charging. I have to fiddle with the connections on both ends, and even the AC adapter until it starts charging. This makes me leery about removing the charger to take the iPad elsewhere. It is not the cords or AC adapter as two sets do the same thing.Is it just me or do others feel that Apple has gone downhill since Steve Jobs is not longer there.

  So this is my first fitness tracker / smart watch. In fact its my first watch of any kind for a few years. I tried the cellular version and then returned it a few weeks ago for the GPS only version. Primary goal of the cellular was to free myself from carrying my phone whilst going running. too many subscription based apps, however, made this impractical, so the data plan wasn't really of much use. Plus it chews through more battery (more on that later). So yeah I think the tech ability  is finally here but Apple's ecosystem isn't very friendly to bundling your own playlists, so I continue to run with my phone AND watch AND bt headphones. Boo. Friggin. Who.I am guessing the white band of the Starlight model probably turns a lot of people off, but you should know that bands are really easy to change, and cheap on the after market. I love the look of the starlight watch frame with a colored band. it gives the watch both the ability to be uniquely fun but can also have a more conservative look with a gun metal grey band.The touch features are fantastic, as are the health features like vital signs. I've compared them to a real pulse oximeter and the o2 readouts are within 1% every time. Even the EKG sinus rhythm appears quite similar to a 12 lead. Remember, though, that this feature will not reliably detect (rule out) a heart attack.Usability is quite good, also. the mini keyboard is surprisingly easy to use. Sure its not your phone, but it gets the job done. Voice to text is great and I find myself using that more than the keyboard. After about a week it primarily becomes just a time piece on your wrist as the novelty wears off, but appreciable features include the ability to glance at texts without pulling out my phone, and the flashlight feature is very handy as well.there are a number of plastic/rubber covers on the market. I bought a two pack for use when i'll be out in the yard or an area where the watch may see more abuse. its more difficult to apply than changing the bands, which must come off to apply a protective cover. The screen naturally looses a small degree of touch sensitivity but is still quite usable. Mostly I go about my business without the cover. the 7 purportedly has a more durable screen and in a few months of use now I've yet to scratch it.My biggest complaint, other than the music options for going running, is the battery life. I find myself charging it two or three times a day. Not that it needs that many top offs, but I don't like seeing any battery dip below 50%. the nice thing is that the charge is quite quick and painless with the so-called hockey puck. I can't imagine how frustrated I'd be with previous generations that don't charge as quickly as the 7.if you have small wrists go for the 41mm. Medium and large will probably be happier with the 45mm.

  I do a lot of research before making large purchases and I surely did before deciding on the Apple Watch 7.  I was considering the Apple Watch SE mostly for price.  I was upgrading from a Series 3 so anything would be better.  After reading details and specs I landed on the Series 7 45mm with cellular.  I've worn it everyday for the past 2 weeks and I know I made the right decision.  The watch face is large and clear.  I can easily use apps and respond to text message.  I realized I actually use my phone less while out and about.I can highly recommend the Series 7 to anyone who has a older series watch or has never purchased one before.  If you have a 5 or 6, I would wait to see what the NEW Series 8 has to offer, unless you just want a bigger screen.I also recommend to read the information concerning your watch choice before buying.  Many people do not do their (homework) before buying, then complain about the product.  Apple no longer supplies the charging block with their iPhones, Watches or AirPods.  The 11pro, 12 series, 13 series iPhones have USB-C to Lightning cables.  The Watch Series 7 also uses this cable.  Meaning, if you don't have access to USB-C charging you will need to purchase a charging block.  I can recommend Apple or Anker products.  Also, the Apple Watch Series 7 requires your iPhone to be updated to the latest iOS version.  Interestedly enough, all this is noted on the outside of the box your watch comes in, as well as on the documentation in the box.I hope this helps you in making a decision concerning the Apple Watch Series 7.  So many of the reviews I read through were a joke, fake or just a idiot user.  Cheers

  I got this as a gift from my wife for my birthday and I love it!  I had an Apple Watch (series 2) that stopped working a bit over a year ago. My wife got me this to replace it.The jump from series 2 to 7 was dramatic!  I did research to find out exactly what was different and I was disappointed to find out that it still had an 18 hour battery life. However, through my experience it can last closer to 30 hours per charge. But I do only use it as a watch and occasionally a timer so I imagine that having an influence on battery life.It also was fully connected and updated within an hour and came with about 80 percent battery life.The only downside is that it doesn’t come with a charging brick however this is standard for Apple as they stopped including bricks years ago. You still get the cable though.All in all I love it and I love the deep red color that this watch is!

  I expected the latest watch to work seamlessly with the latest iPhone.  This is the latest watch.  I have the latest iPhone.I'm in recovery from two episodes of a dangerous heart arrhythmia and my exercise program consists of approximately 1 hour moderately intense walks each day.  At minimum, I wanted the watch to count steps, maybe measure distance as well, and measure and keep track of my heart rate.  I also expected to be able to access this information fairly easily and when I wanted to on my iPhone as well as on the watch.Apple buried the pedometer if it has one, and if it has one, you can't put it on the watch face I just spent a long time selecting as the one that I liked.  Apparently Apple restricts third parties from creating useful watch faces, so there aren't that many, and there isn't one I could put what I wanted on.I installed a pedometer app.  I bought the watch having been assured by the salesman that this watch had or this watch even was a pedometer.  What am I doing installing a pedometer app?  This seemed like buying an iPhone and having to install a phone app.  If you know the watch OS, I hope it wouldn't take you that long to set this up just the way you want it, but I didn't have the patience.  I think I got the number of steps to display but then there wasn't a place to put the heart rate.  I expected less hassle for this simple function.I opened the iPhone Watch app.  I'm sure there is a way to get it out of the Settings screen, but at this point, as I was about to refresh my perception of how this app wasn't that easy to use, I can't get it to do anything except alter various settings.  I can't back out of the Settings into the program itself.  I've only been using computers since 1982 or so, when I studied assembly language on a machine with 1K Ram and cassette tape instead of a hard drive, so it could be that I'm not capable of figuring out how to operate the easy to use Apple software interface.I even have an Apple Watch for Dummies book, the latest edition.  I ended up looking online for solutions to problems as they came up because for me the book was full of a lot of tips and info except no info on the particular problem, whatever it was, that I had.Apple doesn't even consider the type of exercise that I am doing at the moment, i.e. fairly gentle walking coming back from a serious heart issue, as exercise.  So they program their software out of the box to ignore the type of walking I do, so people say.  Maybe the watch can be tweaked or if I muttered the right incantation it might decide my walks are exercise,  but as I looked for info on how to make the watch display information about my proposed walks, the first warnings I ran into were that walks are not exercise in the Apple ecosystem unless they are of a certain intensity.  I don't know because I couldn't set up the watch well enough to even take it for a walk before I gave up and told my wife, who gave it to me as a present, that I was going to send it back.The screen is beautiful.  The 45mm watch seems too big and bulky for me and I am 6 foot 1 inch with big hands.  The aesthetically appealing watch faces are the least customizable.  I made sure to turn the alarm off but it went off at 6:30 am anyway, and it would not manually stop sounding off every few minutes after that.  Etc.  I'm sure I could have found some setting other than alarm OFF that would have made the alarm not be set to go off tomorrow morning, but...

  Save yourself time and money and purchase an earlier generation.  It's hard to justify this purchase price for marginal improvements from earlier iterations.  The Corporate Greed stinks, with their ruse of changing the prior iteration of charger to a USB system, so you need to purchase new stuff all around.  Yes, they include the cable with the USB-C, but the CHEAPOS don't include the plug.  Further, the one I received a couple weeks ago has been having non-stop charging issues and the battery life has been POOR.  Count on spending another $100 if you want the authentic plug and a second set.  Then again, maybe they're brilliant and they did all this nonsense to raise my heart rate to hit my fitness goals.

  I have been wanting an apple watch, and finally purchased one.  I was a little leary with the battery life only being 18 hours, but it actually lasts for more than 24 hours!  I fully charge my watch each day (because I wear it to bed), and it only gets down to about 40% by the time I charge it again.  The calling and texting from the watch is awesome!

  So I’m only writing to say I have no idea what’s with some of these reviews. Okay no IT doesn’t come with a 9.99 block to usb-c. Big deal. If you can spend $400 bucks on a watch I think we can get that piece. It DOES come with the magnetic charger super fast charge chord that is $30 bucks. Also this watch syncs perfectly fine. I’ve bought 3 so far. For people that claim to be tech savvy but took 6 hours? I’m pretty with it still but other than saying did I want to sync it to my phone AFTER updating the phone it was fine. You buy a tech wifi product and it’s going to need updates but other than it telling and showing you how to sync up your phone there’s literally nothing to this. I bought it for my 82 year old mother . Showed her in minutes how to take an ECG, and pulse ox. Send a message, make a call, talk to Siri, set an appointment , reminder, alarm, Use the calendar , Set and measure her activity and set her ICE so if she falls and doesn’t get up the phone will contact us. For what it is and all it’s features , ease of use, this thing is amazing. I bought it on the $349. Price which really is pretty remarkable for all of it’s features. Lot’s of complaining here for something that’s a pretty amazing and bonus with an emergency alert for her to get help. I’m not sure how much people feel is okay to pay for all of this but for me it’s one of my favorite things and seeing my moms face light up and marvel over this thing makes me say it’s money well spent. Apple is a business, so is Verizon, Cable companies , service providers any many other monthly expenses that overcharge and don’t include all the accessories you need either. Apps are also money makers but some of them make our lives convenient. Go on you tube and look up how to set up your phones/watches. It shouldn’t take anyone 6 hours. From the time my mom opened it, while on a FaceTime call with my brother in Germany within literally 5 minutes it was syncing to her phone. Nothing difficult about it.

  The iOS is horrible, frustrating, and counter intuitive. Want a stopwatch? Not on this device! Oh it has a stopwatch that is useless garbage. After one minute, the only thing it displays is 1:—:—. What genius thought of this? It’s not saving battery, the display is still on! You can raise your wrist and the numbers appear, but if I have a heavy dumbbell in my hand or I’m stabilizing it in my lap, I can’t move my wrist. Just have the flipping numbers on screen!! FFS. Do you want to know what minute you’re on after 70 seconds? Tough sh**, the screen switches to the time. So now you’re forced to bring up your wrist. And yes, I’ve looked up and changed every setting possible. Nothing I do prevents this. Well, why don’t you download a third part app? Hey, let’s try that. That was a massive headache itself and after I finally did download a third party stopwatch app that showed all of the numbers, the amazing, intuitive Apple iOS darkens and reverts to the time. Un-flipping-believable. Want to turn that setting off? Tough sh**, Mr. Customer, you can only look at the app for 70 seconds, so screw your three minute timer, peasant. “What you need to do is toggle the hide sensitive complications options on or off.” Guess what, that doesn’t work. Not after 70 seconds. While I’m talking about the display, sometimes an app view screen shows up randomly and I literally can’t do anything to get out of it. The only option I have is to turn it off and back on again. That’s extremely frustrating. Also, they need to figure out which direction the scroll when is used for. One screen the scroll wheel moves the screen in the direction you push the wheel (up is up and down is down), but when you go to move the cursor to edit text, down on the wheel moves the cursor up. Why? Why would they do this? Well we’re on the subject of text, the talk to text on this watch is atrocious. I can say the exact same thing on my iPhone and it works great. The watch simply does a turd job at understanding talk to text. When I do scroll down to go up and select a word to change it to something that I actually said instead of what it wrote, the options simply aren’t there. Ever. Also, when I’m on the workout app tracking my heart rate and I switch to a Stopwatch app to track my time in between sets, I looked down at my watch to check the time and it switched back to the workout app! That’s so extremely frustrating. When I switch to another app I want to look at that flipping app. I don’t want you to change to the time, I don’t want you to change apps regardless of what you think I want to see. It’s little stuff like this that makes me want to ask, will it blend? Sometimes I think putting it down the garbage disposal or in a Vitamix would make me much happier due to the frustration I have with the iOS. What stops me from doing that? The hardware. The hardware is really amazing. I love the way it feels in my wrist, I love the heart rate monitor which never drops my heart rate (unlike every Fitbit or Mio watch I’ve had). The screen is fantastic, the haptics are really nice and not overbearing. For the amount that this thing cost the fact that the software is so crippling there’s no way I can recommend someone purchase this until they get the iOS fixed.

  I don't understand why people - even real techies are complaining about the charging situation of the watch.  Can't you read?  Need to do your due diligence before buying.  It says what's in the box.  You can buy an Apple 20W charging block for $20.00.  I guarantee you'll need it for the future.  You can also buy adapters.  If you just read what's in the box, you could have avoided lots of stress.  Everything would have arrived together.  As to the updates, from what I understand the updates need go in sequence.  If you don't have the latest, you need to update.  If you don't have one or 2 previous updates you need to add those updates first.  I am an old dog who hates to learn new tricks, Apple make things easier and I'm happier for it.  Thanks Apple

  This watch comes with no means of connecting it to electricity to charge it.  It has as C connection and they want another $19 for a plug that allows you to connect to the electricity to get a charge.  I went elsewhere and bought the charger, I refused to give them extra money.  It was not the $19 it was the fact that they would sell a product that could not be used out of the box.

  I speak for many in the track and field world who have tried and tried to enjoy Apple Watch as a fitness device. Problem is the lack of a physical start/stop button makes timing short races impossible. Whether you are timing yourself on repeat 400s or timing other athletes on 100s, 200s, 800s or miles. Fact is we sweat a lot on the track especially during summer workouts. We need a start and stop button!! Apple clearly hasn’t asked a track athlete’s opinion on this. The Watch is a great device for daily life. However it shouldn’t advertise as a fitness device. If stoping the clock during a summer workout is not possible this it is not a fitness device.

  I’m sure the product is fine, I can’t check because it’s a Xmas gift and I don’t want to mess up the setup process for my wife. However, the watch came already opened. This obviously did not come from the factory, nor did they even attempt to present it that way and it’s very apparent that somebody has gone through the box it comes in for who knows what reason. Just takes away from the presenting aspect. My wife now has to open a $400 Apple Watch on Xmas that looks like it came in a used box. Very disappointing.

  I had the series 3 for three years, and never scratched the screen — I use the watch daily and have a very active lifestyle. The series 7, within two weeks, I noticed a huge scratch on it and did not have any incidents where I would have scratched it like this. I googled this problem and discovered many people are experiencing the same thing. Apparently while it's more shatter resistant, it's less scratch resistant. Wish I knew. Definitely get a screen protector, I'm extremely disappointed to have such a gouge in a VERY expensive watch.

  Amazing - I received this watch as a gift.  Turns out the charging cable is faulty.  Chatted with them online, they told me to go to an apple store who confirmed the cable was faulty after a long examination.  They didn't have any of the new usb-c charging cables and at first said they couldn't send one to me, that I had to come back to the store.  After pressing them, I was told that apple care would call me that night which they did.  They would send one to me as long as I sent the faulty cable back.  9 days later, it hasn't shipped and support continues to fumble around for a response.  They could send me an older model cable...they could send me a new dual mag cable...but no, they continue without a clue.  So much for a premium product and excellent support.  I'm sure the cable costs them <$1.  What's my time and frustration worth?  What's a bad review worth??

  The watch face had a very visible scratch right out of the box. When I contacted Amazon support they directed me to Apple support and said I would have to send the  BRAND NEW watch in to be replaced. I think that is kind of ridiculous that I spent this kind of money on a watch that was damaged before I got it, and now I have to send it to someone else for repair. The Apple support sight is no help what so ever unless you have a software problem. I can't even just send the watch back to Amazon for a refund without going through Amazon support. At this point I just want to send it back for a refund, but Amazon and Apple are making that difficult!

  My Apple Watch series 7 was a great investment because I use it multiple times every day: day of the month for writing checks, set timer for cooking, outside temperature, outside weather, battery charge, DJIA, tracking sleep. The quarter hour chimes keep my on track throughout the day and serve as a good antidote to procrastination.  The Infographics watch face allows instant monitoring of up to 7 functions (""complications"") simultaneously.  For me, one device on my wrist is more convenient than multiple devices in various locations:  in my pocket, on my wall, and on my desk.

  Ordering and receiving went fine. I am disappointed with the watch though I just switched from Fitbit to the Apple Watch 7 and had an expectation that I would be able to configure my watch face how I wanted. I want to have my step count on the face and I want to see my current heart rate not what it was 7 minutes ago. Those two things make me think my purchase was wrong and I should have stayed with Fitbit. My two other major disappointments are with the battery life ( my Fitbit had a 5-7 day battery life) and not coming with the brick. I had already upgraded my phone so I knew there wouldn’t be a charging brick and cable but still very disappointed. I have only had my watch for 3 days but am not sure if I made the right decision or if I will go back to Fitbit. So disappointed

  I switched from a Fitbit to an Apple watch and I am in love! I love that my phone and apps seamlessly pair with the watch and I can get notifications even when I'm not attached at the hip to my phone. I'm still not completely sold on the phone, but the watch has sold me on itself. It didn't come with a charging block, just the cord, but it seems like that's standard. I had one on hand so I was not worried. It also did take time to get it connected, but I had to update the phone's operating system first.

  I received this watch yesterday. I may rewrite or add to this review later. Day one didn’t go well. The first problem encountered was software update. That took over 30 minutes and then I had to put the watch on the charger to finish updating. An hour later, I began setting up the watch. Each click screen (Accept - do later), the watch froze up. Two hours after starting, the watch finally works, almost. The cellular phone feature didn’t work until 24 hours later. I placed the watch on charge again at 8:00 pm that night. I put the watch back on at 10:30 pm to go to bed with 100% charge. I use the watch as an alarm clock. I was awakened at 7:30 am. The watch showed 79 % charged. So far I have had to charge the watch twice a day. The watch comes with two small bands and no charger.

  Love this watch! Was unsure whether to get the 6 or the 7. I have a smaller wrist and the 41mm 7 fits PERFECT. The screen in the Apple Watch 6 40mm was just too small and the 44mm was too chunky for me. Remember to change your settings to get the most battery life. I can go about 20-30 hours without charging. Even so, charging only takes 30 minutes with the usb-c.

  This was a great Christmas present. My significant other really enjoys to wear the watch, the original band that comes with it is also small enough for people with very slim spindly antenna like wrists to wear comfortably. It has many nice features including weirdly enough a strange ability to read how much oxygen is in your blood that has something to do with lights and colors and sounds and the feeling of being on a giant rock that is moving through space at incredible speeds, you are alive. Look up, look up, I see you now. You look nice, take care of yourself. Enjoy this product by Apple, goodbye!

  As far as the sleep cycle and what not I really can’t say. However I immediately bought the 45mm and I absolutely LOVE it 😍 I’ve had an off brand sheet watch that would monitor my bp (frightfully accurate I should add) for 3 years and though I loved it and the corresponding ap i couldn’t help myself and bought the Apple Watch series 7. I could NOT be more pleased with this product! It IS worth the $$

  I suppose it's been a long time coming. I was an early adopter of smart watches having purchased the original Moto 360 (the flat tire, anyone remember that?) along with a string of other Android Wear watches (now Wear OS) from LG, Fossil, Skagen, Mobvoi and eventually going with Samsung's Tizen watches for one simple reason: the OS just worked reliably, especially compared with Android/Wear OS. I got the Gear S2, the S3, Gear Sport, Galaxy Watch and the follow-up, Galaxy Watch 3 (they skipped 2). Then I heard that Samsung was abandoning Tizen and going back to Wear OS - but only after stepping in and helping Google with a software face lift (which it desperately needed) giving us Wear OS 3.0. My first reaction was one of anger and disappointment. I've invested SO MUCH into Tizen and here they go abandoning it?? Slowly, I began to become hopeful that maybe, just MAYBE this was the iteration of Wear OS that fixes the lagging, glitching and stuttering issues that had plagued every single Wear OS device I had ever owned. I WILL say that I have experienced almost no issues with my TicWatch Pro 3 (aside from the utterly abysmal haptic vibration). It is as close to running flawlessly as I have ever experienced with Wear OS. I only assumed that since the Galaxy Watch 4 was about a year NEWER, that it simply HAD to be better, right?It wasn't. The GW4 was as bad as any previous Wear OS watch I had ever used, and in several cases, considerably worse. I was just crestfallen...not to mention, out several hundred dollars having purchased one shortly after release. At first maybe I thought I just had a bad model, but nope. Look online and you'll see my experience isn't isolated in the slightest. It's fairly typical...meaning it's a software issue that Google and Samsung either can't, or won't fix. I preferred my previous Tizen smart watches. A LOT.During all this time however, I had secretly always liked the apple watches. It took a bit to warm up to the square-ish design however, but I finally did. But, that's a far cry from actually wanting to BUY one. Shortly after the release of the Series 7 watch, I discovered something that took me by surprise. Apple now will allow you to use one of their watches WITHOUT needing to have it tethered to an iPhone. This caught my attention BIG TIME. Initially I wanted to set one up without an iPhone altogether because no matter how fast or efficient iOS is, I will never like it as much as I do the customization you get with Android that apple simply CANNOT touch no matter how hard they try.The truth is, you MUST have an iPhone to set up your watch initially...THEN you can operate it without needing an iPhone. Thankfully I was able to get both thru my job. I now have an iPhone 12 and a blue, 45mm Apple Watch 7 LTE. I prefer my watch. Like, A LOT. Am I ready to say it's altogether better than my Galaxy Watch 4? Oh, absolutely without question. There are a few things I preferred with my GW4 though, such as the ease of adding music to the watch for listening to while working out. Seriously, NOBODY makes adding music to their smart watch easier. I initially thought it was going to be a breeze, but boy was I mistaken. It took 3 days before I found a program that would allow me to transfer my music (in bulk, several other programs let you do it, but unless you paid a fee, they would only allow you to do 10 songs per day - and let's face it, I don't have the patience to download 300 songs over the course of 30 days. I finally discovered a program that made the transfer relatively simple, but honestly, apple shouldn't make you work THAT hard to do this one thing IMO. HUGE pain in my behind in order to get this done, but now that I have......I love my Series 7 watch. It looks great, like really. That screen is fantastic. Not any better than my Samsung watches, but easily as good. I DO think it can get a wee bit brighter, though. I've read a few people saying setting up their Series 7 took forever while claiming to be tech-oriented...but that wasn't my experience at all. Seriously, coming to iOS BRAND NEW, and barely understanding how an iPhone works compared with Android, I was able to set up my watch and had it on my wrist within 15-20 minutes or so. Easy peasy. Yes, I consider myself fairly good at operating new tech, but some of these other experiences I've read about simply seems foreign to me after the smooth experience I had. I will say this however, since my watch was ordered online and shipped to me, I didn't really inspect whether or not the cellular function was actually working until I had been using the watch for a good 2 weeks or so. It wasn't set up, and in fact, took a bit to finally hammer out how to do it, and I finally figured it out, but if I'm honest, I was on the last step of what I was going to try before bringing it into a store to have the experienced folks at T-Mobile do it for me. Yes, it was unnecessarily complicated and shouldn't be. Oh well, I thought I'd include that anyway.So overall, what do I think about my Apple Watch 7? It runs as flawlessly as I had hoped - and not just a little better than the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4...it can runs CIRCLES around that watch. I would say my older Galaxy Watch 3 runs as smooth as the Series 7 does though. It may not be quite as fast overall, but I have never had an issue with my Tizen watches glitching or stuttering, at least so far anyway. The watch sync's up with my iPhone 12 seamlessly - which really IS one of the hallmarks of apple products being able to link together so well and kudos to Cupertino for doing that job so well. My Tizen and Wear OS watches will have issues connecting with my phones about 30% of the time which is annoying. This was a bigger issue with my Tizen watches than any of the Wear OS devices, so I'm not sure what the issue is, but it was definitely one I spotted right away.Honestly, the truth of the matter is this: I just want my watch to work reliably when I need it to. I just cannot say that about pretty much every Wear OS watch I've owned. When I turn my watch on, I almost forget about it because I don't have to worry about it not connecting to my phone, or sending me notifications, it just WORKS.Haptics are just better on apple than any other smart watch made - at least any that I am currently familiar with. It's hard to describe the difference. The watch vibrates differently than every other I've ever owned and it's very, VERY hard to miss. Great job, apple.I don't think there are as many watch faces that are truly as good as the variety I had with TIzen, but I like a lot of them, and for that I'm happy.I really like the digital crown for navigating the watch, especially when I don't want to touch the screen. Very cool. I still think Samsung's circular bezel is hands-down the best way to navigate without touching the face, but this is as close as you can get I believe and it works great.I love the health benefits of using the watch, too. Keeping track of my workouts is great. I have worn my GW3 and my apple watch a couple times and noticed they were virtually identical in readings, so I'd say they both record workouts fairly well (I did the same with my GW4 as well and found it on par, too). There are some things I prefer with one OS over the other, like after I've ran a mile, I preferred the way Tizen stops the music entirely to tell you that you've reached 1 mile, how long it took you, how many steps and your current heart rate and then re-starts the music. Wear OS 3.0 is slightly different. It doesn't stop the music, just lowers the volume while it tells you much the same info but slightly different. The apple watch just tells you that you've completed a mile and how long it took while the music audio lowers in volume. I'm not sure if you can have it read back more info or not, but if there is, I haven't found it. All things considered, I prefer the Galaxy Watch 3 way of telling you info to the rest...but this is purely subjective. The active rings though...? I'm not sure I care about them to be honest, but for those who do, they can be helpful.I love the ability to answer texts using that keyboard instead of having to use the Siri/microphone (which is WAY better than Bixby, let's be clear on that). It works surprisingly well with the swype feature enabled. I'm very happy about that. You can also use scribble if you'd rather write it out letter by letter with your finger. I don't usually use this, but always nice to have as an option.So...how is battery life? Well, after doing a lot of research on the apple watches over the years and especially leading up to my getting one, I have been absolutely floored by how good it has been. Seriously, I expected it to suck right out of the box. But - it didn't. The best battery life I've ever experienced still goes to the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 (and yes, I realize the battery it has is much bigger, but still) followed by my original Galaxy Watch. The GW3 and 4 have each gotten steadily worse battery life than those other 2...and this is another gripe I have with Wear OS (despite the fact the TicWatch runs that same OS)...most manufacturers either forego giving us a bigger battery, or just have us deal with crappy battery life and rarely do we get much in the way of anything in the middle...unless you're comparing those with the apple watch. I was VERY surprised at how good it's been. To compare, twice I have walked 5 miles home from work, wearing both my Galaxy Watch 3 and the apple watch, and the GW4 and the apple watch. I used GPS and bluetooth for music listening and when I got home, the apple watch had more juice...by as much as 15-20% more. For those who are familiar with smart watches, if you kick in the GPS its going to adversely affect your battery life significantly. Same with listening to music. I never use the always on display, so that isn't a factor at all for me. The GW3 has had better battery life than the 4 from the very beginning (and the original GW had even better battery life), but the apple watch routinely still has 70-80% full battery when I get home, depending on how far I've walked and how much I've used it to check on incoming texts, emails etc. With the GW3 I'm usually have 60% or so and the GW4 is below 50%, sometimes down to almost 40% by the same point in my hiking and after the same amount of time being on my wrist since I woke up. I don't really bother with sleep tracking or trying to squeeze another day out of the battery life, so that doesn't intrigue me. I tend to put the watch on the charger at the end of every day no matter where its at and shut it off once it's been topped off. But based on what I have at the end of each day, I'm fairly confident I could get 2 days use, and especially if I didn't use it for GPS and bluetooth listening...but I haven't actually tried to do that, so I'm not 100% certain of this. All I know is for MY practical experience, I've been very happy with the battery life. Don't get me wrong, I'd love twice the battery life I'm already getting, but I think you get the idea.I love the customization of the watch bands...but in this day, if you release a watch that cannot support being able to swap out different watch bands, you deserve to fail. I have the blue 45mm variant watch and I think it looks fantastic. That screen is 20% larger than the Series 6 they say, and while I've not used an apple watch before, the watch itself doesn't really look bigger and the more screen you can use isn't super obvious unless you have an older model literally right next to it to compare it with. For those who are using an even older watch, you probably will notice the difference, especially if you've been using the Series 3.I recommend watching some YouTube videos that teach you the best way to utilize your watch, get the most out of it, best apps to download and how to maximize battery life if you truly want to squeeze every drop of power from your watch you can. They are very helpful.If only they would allow you to use an apple watch with an android, WOW I may never go back to a Wear OS device ever again...and as long as I'm admitting things, as it stands right now, I doubt I will be buying any other brand of smart watch in the future now that I've used the Series 7 and have seen what a truly capable smart watch can do regularly that doesn't include glitches, stuttering and whatnot. Just keepin' it real, y'all. In short, I love my watch. Kudos to apple for producing a watch that truly does earn the title of best smart watch available. I just wish Samsung would go back to Tizen. But oh well. So many believe it was a smart move to go back to Wear OS, but I'm sorry folks, I'm not one of them. At least not with the current way their watches perform. HUGE let down IMO.***UPDATE***I have to say something about Siri and it's ability to write text for you. It is ridiculously fast. Easily on par with Google Assistant, and a bit faster than any Wear OS device I have personally ever used. It is remarkably accurate, too. SUPER Kudos for that. Also, the included keyboard is pretty sweet. It isn't quite as easy to use as the GBoard for Wear OS, but it is definitely better than all the other included keyboards I've seen for smart watches (again, other than GBoard). Another mark in apple's favor IMO.I wish I knew why apple chose to turn on the watches WiFi every single time you enter a building and your phone attempts to hook up to it. I wish there was a way to disable this automatic feature and so far, haven't been able to figure it out...I don't think I can at this point.I love the complications you can add to your screen. VERY customizable. Better implemented than Wear OS or Tizen watches I have to say. Most faces can add a lot - but not all apps as complications if you choose to. Some limit you to only a couple, but hey, at least there's the option, right? I prefer one for each corner of the screen. Some faces allow for even more than that. Again, very well done and very convenient!***UPDATE #2***I want to say I really appreciate how fast the charging is. I also want to say that by now, apple really is behind the ball when it comes to reverse wireless charging of their watches. C'mon guys, are you just lazy? Same with Samsung not including at least fastER charging by this point. Seriously, both have screwed the public when it comes to this one area. My series 7 charges quite a bit faster than my GW4, but I can also top off my GW4 using my Galaxy S21 Ultra anywhere I'm at...both have good and bad points here folks. It's up to you to decide which is best for your own personal uses though. I'm just pointing them out is all.***UPDATE #3***I discovered a couple things. The main reason why the battery is so good when I'm on my hikes while it's using GPS and bluetooth to play music is because it's actually using the GPS thru my phone. When I went on a walk the other day and left my iPhone at home, I came back and noticed an astonishingly big discrepancy of battery usage from when my phone is with me. From 92% after a 5 mile hike to 63% for the same walk without my phone. Hmmm. Interesting. Also, adding music STILL SUCKS. I've added songs I don't know HOW many times that still don't show up on my watch. So friggin' frustrating. This is one area Samsung not only wins, but literally decimates apple in simplicity and ease of use. Trust me, that's a feat considering how buggy my Galaxy Watch 4 is.

  Like a lot of Apple products, this product is also exclusive in the hacked watch market. Lots of companies that offer watches, albeit at better prices but without a good price, which is not the case. This watch is a bit expensive but very affordable for those who have an iPhone. It just completes the little holes that the iPhone does not cover for us. For those who have a pacemaker it is recommended to consult a doctor

  My daughter and son-in-law bought this watch for me for Christmas.  Overall, I'm impressed.  The battery life is about 36 hours, but will charge fully in less than one hour with the included Apple charging cable and a real good (Anker) USB-C 20 watt charger.  I was banging on the counter top the other night (after grinding coffee beans) and the watch wanted to know if I had taken a hard fall.  The phone portion of the watch sounds great on both ends and the step count is fairly accurate.  I'm still way behind on just what this watch can do, but so far, it's been really amazing.  Highly recommended!!

  Pro’s.  Got the 45 , nice large face. I’m 6’4 and 215.  / easy set up just scan the face and follow prompts ( I have the iPhone 11) / heart app including ecg works great ( why I bought it) /decent price.  Cons  no wall wart for charger cable / strap is garbage, I replaced with a snap flex metal look type /I also bought a set of three screen protectors. / made in China unfortunately/. As it stands now, after a week, (unless they make a health watch with equal gizmos in the USA ) I’d buy it again. If something changes and the watch boinks out , I’ll change my review. Oh and watch the price, it seems to fluctuate every few days. Now it’s 371. I paid 379 and yesterday it was 419. And I did put the watch in a kinda sleep mode ( come on with wrist movement or tap the screen) and it surely helps battery life a lot.  Still needs charging at some point every day. I especially need it at night.

  What made me buy this is a review from a purchaser that said it saved her life because of the heart monitor.  So far so good I love it I even purchased the model that said GPS only but I can talk and make calls on it, adding cellular I think is a ploy for phone carriers to make more money.  You can just get the GPS only and still make and receive calls on your watch using your phone number NOT a phone number the phone company gives you that is separate from your phone and then charge you for it.  I bought it used but it still has warranty on it.

  The charger makes this purchase worth it.After all the gimmicks that apple can sell you, the charger is where it is at. You can charge this thing very fast and hence you are basically able to wear it all the time. it maybe takes 30 mins to charge it. The EKG is okay, it only gives you lead 2 (from my testing). It is somewhat accurate but the read-out AI read EKG will always give you sinus rhythm.  O2 sats are accurate and everything else is similar to that of the previous model.

  Had this watch for maybe three weeks now? So far it works great, I love the sleep tracking and the ecg apps. I’m a telemetry tech so I find it neat to see my own rhythm and not have to put on the hospitals box to see it 😂The battery lasts roughly 24 hours depending how much I’m on it (which is a lot because I’m still toying will all it has to offer). Love that I can locate my phone with my watch and vice versa (yes, I lose my phone a lot in my own home). I didn’t realize I could actually take calls on the watch, that was pretty cool the first time I answered, and it was clear. Love that instead of looking down at my phone while using gps, it’s right on my wrist where to turn. Overall my switch from android in general has been pretty successful so far. Just wished I didn’t have to charge the watch every day while my phone lasts 2-3 (sometimes 4) days. I just charge it while I’m folding laundry and it takes roughly an hour to reach 100%, so I will take that fast charge any day!

  Shame on you Apple.  They charge $400 for a watch and do not include a way to charge it, WTF.  The charging cable is included but no way to plug it into a wall outlet or a computer, unless you already have a Type C adaptor block. I would suggest that Apple stop with the ridiculous packaging and include the $10 adaptor, which probably only costs them $2 to make.  I have never purchased an electronic product that does not come with a way to charge it. I now have to a buy a Type C adaptor before I can use the watch, which is beyond frustrating.

  It's my first apple watch. An awesome feature like monitoring the heart rate, blood oxygen & ECG on demand. It's very comfortable to wear. many daily reminders activity alerts. very smooth. fabulous touch.The series 7 45mm is the best and most high-resolution screen. it has some wonderful nice watch faces along with custom faces features.it's a great product from Apple. battery life is too good. it's the best smartwatch for iPhone owners.

  This is my second purchase of an Apple Watch! I previously had series 4! Mistakenly run over it with a lawnmower! I love all the features and convenience of the cellular series! Never really used the sleep tracking because I dislike sleeping with a watch on. Sort of expensive however it’s worth the price for me . Excellent buy! Thanks!

  I really like the new Apple Watch 7 series. The screen (though only 1 mm bigger"" seems much larger and clearer. I have not yet tried the sleep tracking function as the one time I slept with the watch on the ""protective case"" I bought for it cracked (see my other review on that). The watch offers several notable upgrades from the 5 series and the clarity and readability of the screen alone are worth it when it is time to upgrade or your old watch gives out.

This watch is not as bulky as the 3, is much faster, has more features and is priced right.

  I upgraded for the Apple Watch 3 to this, and find myself using it even more than before. This is great for workouts as the larger screen makes it much easier to make little adjustments to music or check your distance while running. It is also great for work when you are in meetings, you can send response to callers. The battery is also significantly better. While I usually charge each night, it is fully capable of going two days on one charge. Highly recommend!

  I really like the Apple Watch Series 7 45mm size. It’s not too big at all. Upgraded from Series 4, 40mm and I couldn’t justify going to the 41mm size.

Using the Health App is easy and tracks many important activities. Absolutely No regrets with this purchase. Highly recommend. Thank you Amazon.

   Wow that was fast. 24 hours after purchase had Apple Watch series 7 on my wrist. Upon unboxing the watch face displayed, “low battery“ I put it on the charger and it was 3/4 charged in less than 15 minutesI had to download and install the latest updates, this process took a little longer than I had expected.After watching other reviews that questioned The authenticity of their purchase product of course I was a little nervous going into such a large purchase. However, this is absolutely Apple. You can feel it and see it in the packaging before you even get to the good stuff. I think that it’s important to mention that I did purchase the Apple care package for $79. Perhaps that ensures the authenticity of what you were purchasing. Just a thought. I can’t wait to start closing those exercise rings and earning those spinning medallions. Happy Apple Girl! 👍🍎Correction. In the last clip of the video I said 40 MM obviously it’s 45 MM.

  I just got this yesterday and charged it and set it up today.  So far I really like it even though I’m still figuring it out.  I decided to get this after my Fitbit Ionic was recalled (I had worn that for four years).  I’m glad that I went with the larger size after struggling trying to decide which one to get.  I have very small wrists and didn’t know how it would look but it looks fine (it looks bigger in the pictures than it does in person).  Love the way it looks and the band is very comfortable too.  At first it felt a little heavy on my wrist but now I don’t even notice that I have it on and I’ve only worn it for a few hours.  It was packaged well too.

  Really, there are no features worth your time unless you get the cellular version. Mostly you’ll want to listen to music while you run or record workouts seemlessly. This does one of those okay. The other poorly. 6 days of trying to delete and redownload songs have me listing this on Craigslist cause like it worked for one round of songs and now refuses to download anything, even factory reset. When people recommend others? Go with others. Sleep tracking is so bad you have to download external apps btw. The rest of the apps are trash. Might as well get an old school Casio watch bro

   o produto veio em estado impecável e chegou 2 semanas antes do previsto. sobre o relógio em si, ele é muito prático e me ajuda muito a controlar questões de saúde, como por exemplo, os ""anéis"" diários, em que você estabelece uma meta de horas em pé, exercício e queima de caloria, e quando você completa essas 3 metas, você recebe alguns prêmios e isso me motiva bastante. ele também acompanha 3 meses gratuitos do fitness+, aplicativo de exercícios da própria apple. as telas iniciais do apple watch 7, em minha opinião, são maravilhosas também. a bateria não dura tanto, geralmente dura 1 dia e meio pra mim, mas a recarga é absurdamente rápida - você consegue ir de 5% à 90% em 30 minutos. um lado negativo é que vem sem a fonte do carregador, que é diferente da fonte normal, mas não é muito difícil encontrar na internet. no geral, o produto vale muito a pena pela funcionalidade e praticidade, além da integração do sistema apple que é simplesmente maravilhosa!

  Eu tinha o geração 1, que comprei logo quando lançou e fazia um tempo que queria atualizar ele, não por não gostar ou qualquer coisa assim, mas porque queria algumas das novas funcionalidades, como ECG e medição de oxigênio no sangue. Para fazer exercícios e muito bom, da para suar os aplicativos como Strava e já carrega tudo sozinho. A tela e outro ponto positivo, mesmo sendo menor que o meu anterior, ele e maior no seu campo de visão. O único ponto negativo que dou e por conta da compatibilidade das pulseiras, que nesta serie não são compatíveis com as que tinha e assim vou ter de comprar novas, o que não e muito barato. Mancada da Apple na minha opinião.

  O relógio é perfeito! A tela de 41mm é do tamanho ideal para visualizar as msgs e tudo que você está fazendo. O espaço interno de 32Gb ajuda bastante, na hora de você baixar suas músicas no Spotify é escutar enquanto está fazendo atividade física, sem o iPhone próximo. A bateria dura o dia todo, mas mesmo assim precisa carregar toda noite. O relógio é sensacional e maravilhoso. Vale a pena o investimento.

  Usei apple watch series 2 por quase 5 anos, troquei pelo 7 pois queria utilizar o ECG e medidor de O2 . A única expectativa não atendida foi a bateria, que pensei que poderia durar um pouco mais. Mas o mostrador e a precisão do toque na tela, coroa digital estão bem mais aprimorados no series 7.

  O relógio é incrível, tenho que admitir. E é lindo! Pago conta por aproximação (veja se seu banco é compatível), ele é bastante voltado às questões de saúde, monitora batimentos cardíacos, oxigenação…em fim, é um aparelho de muita qualidade. Porém, pense duas vezes antes de comprar pq é muito caro, veja se realmente vale a pena pra você.

  O produto é original Apple, caso hajam dúvidas, pelo menos foi assim que veio para mim.Atenção para aqueles que não conhecem os produtos da maça, nos últimos anos eles não costumam mais colocar o plug de tomada/transformador, e sim, apenas o cabo de energia/dados, o famoso usb. Por isso venho alertar àqueles que esperam pelo o que é dado como básico (cabo, plug), pois o último não está incluso na caixa, apenas o Watch, manuais, cabo de energia com base magnética e a pulseira esportiva com dois tamanhos.
