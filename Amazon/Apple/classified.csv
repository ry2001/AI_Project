5,love my apple watch,screen
6,I love reliable seller arrived with original sealed box as previous comments within the delivery period the only negative point is that I found that the battery lasts a maximum of 2 days at least for me my remaining use everything is great,battery
7,i have been wanting an apple watch for a while i finally found one on here and it has been amazing,screen
8,love everything about this watch,screen
9,great battery life 24 hours i use it to track my runs cycling weight lifting walks much more also not too big just right,battery
10,not even close to performance of a fitbit battery does not last a full day even with always on turned off mine may be defective sleep tracking gives a total but no detail mode has to be manually changed for an outdoor walk apps on the whole work really well with the iphone but in my case the fitbit does just as well for a lot less money and it holds a charge for 4 5 days,battery
11,thanks amazon for the fast shipping love my new series 7 red apple watch,screen
12,very awesome watch,screen
13,if my wife was not so enamored with apple i would never spend another dime with them they been pulling this kind of thing for years and their customers apparently have no problems with this,others
14,the watch is wonderful and those who know it know what I'm talking about perfect in all the functions promised the exceptional delivery very fast came very well packaged and I'm super satisfied,others
15,i love the bigger screen and new features,screen
16,it is a great watch and thanks to amazon i received it a month earlier 10 22 than ordering from apple or verizon and waiting to be delivered on late november or early december,screen
17,this new watch is so much easier to read i really love it,screen
18,i absolutely love my new apple watch i upgraded to the 7 because i had a 2 and my battery was not holding a charge all day the 7 is amazing and was the best price i could find in this model,battery
19,i was hoping this was not a scam because every store was out of this watch i am pleased to say it is perfect,screen
20,excellent all features and upgrades are worth the price battery takes at least 24 hours to be charged again,battery
21,I'm changing models despite the reviews it's worth the upgrade the screen is very beautiful wide the new colors and materials are very cool and the features such as oximetry and heart monitoring and the shock sensor are very important and useful even more in the pandemic,screen
22,i had to call t mobile and give them the serial number to get the cellphone data going and i am 41 i can not see those tiny number but thank god for the zoom in feature before calling them it was taking too long to sync after i called them it was smooth sailing i can use my watch to text and voice my messages all while the kids play on my iphone,screen
23,watch is beautiful everything runs smoothly the health app is tolerable but there are other options in the app store finish of the watch is great the battery is more or less but it charges really fast and very expensive but it works as it should work apple has to polish this watch because it has competitors for half the price that delivers much more,others
24,bought it as a christmas gift for the wifey she loves it it is an upgrade from her last one she loves how she can answer phone calls and talk through it,screen
25,i liked the watch however amazon dropped the price dollar42 less than 5 days after i got it from them amazon refused to refund the price difference so i returned it battery life was awful even when i removed numerous apps from it and turned off numerous notifications the watch itself i also decided i did not need that big of an electronic nanny measuring how long i washed my hands when i needed to take deep breaths etc so i decided to not buy it at all simply not for me,battery
26,satisfied with the screen much more clear for me love this present wifey here,screen
27,the watch is nice the battery life does not last more than a day specially if you use the workout activity app,battery
28,love the screen improvement,screen
29,apps that were included were excellent,others
30,used as a watch and a fitness and health tracker disappointed that the mobile apps are overpriced and require a monthly subscription also requires the the wireless apple headphones and additional monthly data subscription added to phone bill to make full use of the product capabilities,screen
31,i got this specifically for the advertisement that if you fall hard it will call authorities the peace of mind makes it worth every penny,screen
32,it's cool even but it's not worth the price charged to pay 3 thousand on a watch that doesn't identify when I'm sleeping it's ridiculous my previous one of 700 reais did that,others
33,i love my new watch put it really stinks that they do not provide you with a charging block especially since it does not use the same little block as all the others do and you do not see it in the description it is an extra dollar20 to dollar30 for one,others
34,thank you very much,screen
35,great little watch enjoy it a lot and fits my small wrist perfect,others
36,i was worried the watch was not going to work based on some of these reviews but it came in perfect condition it did take a while to charge up but then it was good to go buy it the battery has lasted me all day,battery
37,use everyday good quality and good product,others
38,got this watch as a christmas gift for my husband he loves it it was easy to setup and pair with his iphone he has worn it every day and i am very happy with the quality and the great price,others
39,christmas present made wifes day uses it constantly who knew i am just getting around to relying on my cell for time instead of wristwatch and now i find out everyone is back to their wrist and talking into it next will be molar speaker implants and direct to retinal nerve video gotta love it,others
40,the apples watch has a great set of features integration with apps and level of control on notifications which is something i noticed missing on other watches i had tried ability to unlock your iphone which is great if you are wearing a mask these days also the apple pay is nice bonus best smartwatch i have tried to date biggest draw backs short battery life plan to charge it daily and no temperature sensor,battery
41,great size and great programs to use,screen
42,Excellent product as apple standard however I expected more from the battery,battery
43,i dislike the battery life if you havevto charge it every night so if you have to charge it every night then what good is the sleep function charging cord does not have the usb connection so you also have to go and buy another cord or abother plug to use it,battery
44,i was concerned that it might have been a refurbished product but it was not it is the real deal and everything came in so quickly i am quite happy with my new watch,others
45,it took me a while to decide to upgrade my apple watch hard to justify a smart watch over dollar300 in my opinion however my series 3 was so slow took forever to install an update no space for apps data storage etc i got a fitbit charge 5 as a temporary place holder tried to convince myself i liked it more than an apple watch ultimately i came back to apple i opted for the 41mm series 7 because i did not need an extra 4mm for another dollar100 it moves so seamlessly fast to charge lightyears ahead of the series 3 lots of new watch face templates to choose from beautiful edge to edge display of course you can choose to have always on display but that will quickly deplete your battery life ultimately just get the upgrade that is within your budget and you will not regret it,battery
46,this watch comes with no means of connecting it to electricity to charge it it has as c connection and they want another dollar19 for a plug that allows you to connect to the electricity to get a charge i went elsewhere and bought the charger i refused to give them extra money it was not the dollar19 it was the fact that they would sell a product that could not be used out of the box,others
47,i have owned an apple watch since the 2 i had the 4 and loved it the 7 is equally as great and is faster bigger with always on and blood oxygen detection the stainless steel feels more substantial and looks better but the aluminum is great too i have not owned a titanium or ceramic version all my bands work with this bigger size,strap
48,came in original packaging and was exactly as described was easy to setup and got it connected with my verizon account and it looks good and works as intended,screen
49,very frustrating to get this set up been trying for 2 weeks i just can not get this to set up,others
50,my first watch and its really good it does impossible things but might be little bit expensive though,screen
51,i gave my to my sis and ordered a new serires 7 love at first sight,screen
52,really there are no features worth your time unless you get the cellular version mostly you will want to listen to music while you run or record workouts seemlessly this does one of those okay the other poorly 6 days of trying to delete and redownload songs have me listing this on craigslist cause like it worked for one round of songs and now refuses to download anything even factory reset when people recommend others go with others sleep tracking is so bad you have to download external apps btw the rest of the apps are trash might as well get an old school casio watch bro,others
53,the watch is perfect as always the apple battery leaves something to be desired the rest super met my expectations,battery
54,kinda small compare to 44mmthe main issue is it limit too much i can not change or design the watch face freely or those simple design need some third party app the notification also too limited when i using my phone i can not get vibrate from the watch anymore that lead a problem is1 when turn on do not disturb all silenced like no watch 2 when i planned get notification from watch shake and accidentally open my phone loud noise from my phone come out due to some app is bad design i can not use silence mode if i want to hear something   i know apple like to make decisions for customers but not this one maybe blame bad app developers who silence their app when phone at silence mode when there is a positive media volume,screen
55,my daughter love it i will buy for my two sons,others
56,great product am very happy with purchase took me awhile to figure out getting notifications to work do not know if i messed up the settings so i reset watch and now works great only thing i do not like is needing to charge daily i had a cheap smart watch and it would take 2 3 weeks until it needed to be charged although the cheap smart watch could not be used to answer phone or reply to messages all in all i am very happy with product,battery
57,this is my first ever apple watch i love it actually forgot to put it on today and boy do i miss counting my steps and tracking my activity very happy,screen
58,had the original apple watch ungraded to the 7 works well like being able to make screen print larger good connection with iphone can answer phone with a double clench worth the money,screen
59,i was notified that apple watch package had arrived a short while ago after opening package i realized the watch itself was not in package only the watch band and cord were in box,strap
60,excellent delivery on time product same as advertised totally original apple watch all items advertised came as stated in the ad,screen
61,great watch with many features same crappy battery life my fitbit lasts 10 14 days between recharges,battery
62,love it of course battery life is not compared to fitbit luxe you have to compare apples to apples fitbit is a tracker iwatch is a tiny ipad no comparison the sleep tech could really use some tech update but the added fall program with all the balance monitoring the heart health monitoring hearing monitoring plus so much more is above and beyond anything i have tried fitbit sense not even close in performance but very close in dollardollardollardollar,battery
63,the sleep tracking and mobile apps r great,screen
64,i have no idea it would be there because this is in front or mai gate and 100s of people coming and going we will check tomorrow as soon as we reached there,others
65,i have a small wrist so the adjustable band on this apple watch is perfect for me,strap
66,i like the quality of the watch so nice to use price ok however can be more less expensive,others
67,this brand getting more and more complicated in simple things my messages not working on watch brand new just bought it spend half a day with apple support and it looks like they do not know what to do samsung never failed me and easy to set up all messages and notifications flawlessly working this garbage going back to apple for dollar460 lol what a crap,others
68,love the watch but it does not come with a usb converter or ac dc adapter to charge it pretty chincy choice of packaging for apple who is known for quality and user friendly products,others
69,i bought this for husband and i have series 3 with me when we compare both you have to charging for series is 3 just for 15 mins but to series 7 it takes like 22 mins and still need to keep one more time in a day so a part form battery every this is good quality and all,battery
70,the watch is simply amazing it has ticked all the boxes a smart watch should have amazing battery life and accuracy in health reading is awesome cheers,battery
71,i have had a samsung phone and watch forever just purchased a iphone 13 and this watch absolutely amazing,screen
72,i love my apple watch with my whole heart,screen
73,i have a series 4 and have never felt the need to upgrade as my battery life still lasts me nearly two days it has not been slowed down by any software updates and still works fine i finally decided to upgrade to the series 7 for the larger always on screen and blood oxygen sensor it is definitely not worth it i do not know if it is due to the always on screen or what but the battery life of this new series 7 is far worse than on my 3 year old series 4 watch when i take the watch off it only has 35percent battery left at the end of the day and that is with barely any use whereas my series 4 can still end the day with over 50percent battery left i imagine if i had any workouts or used many apps on the watch during the couple of weeks of owning the watch it would have died before the end of the day also the blood oxygen only seems to work about half the time and the readings are all over the place again i upgraded to have the always on display but that is pointless if i have to disable it to get decent battery life,battery
74,it is my first apple watch an awesome feature like monitoring the heart rate blood oxygen ecg on demand it is very comfortable to wear many daily reminders activity alerts very smooth fabulous touch the series 7 45mm is the best and most high resolution screen it has some wonderful nice watch faces along with custom faces features it is a great product from apple battery life is too good it is the best smartwatch for iphone owners,screen
75,by far the best smartwatch to be used with the apple ecosystem the integration is amazing and you can do practically everything with it including going for a walk with the headphones connected directly to it with music downloaded from spotify really amazing,screen
76,love the gold finish it is not too overwhelming the size is amazing loop is durable and high quality worth it,strap
77,very functional for those who use the apple ecosystem I need heart rate measurements etc. many options for apps and bracelets I find it interesting for those who want to use it in physical activities who only look for cell phone notifications I think the cost x benefit is low for these cases a smartband of 200 reais watch out good,strap
78,not a good battery at all will not get another one,battery
79,my watch ran out of power in less than 2 days,battery
80,my husband went to open up his birthday gift of this apple watch and there was the charger the band but there was no apple watch in the box this is the second time i have ordered an apple watch off amazon and received no apple watch,strap
81,the watch is good nothing to complain mainly because it is much cheaper than the one sold by apple everything came right in the packaging only the invoice was missing that did not come with the product and that I asked the seller but I have not received a return since then,others
82,it is a great watch,screen
83,great watch and great features but the battery does not last long it has to be charged every night,battery
84,excellent arrived before the delivery date new original and sealed product,others
85,cons so if you are switching from a fitbit for your first apple watch like myself you will miss your fitbit it does not track your calories all day like your fitbit because it does not automatically detect your work out calorie burn it does not track your sleep details the same either i almost want to buy a fitbit that is just weird though wearing 2watcheslast bad thing is the battery you have to charge it every day ohand mine was not charging i had to go to best buy and get another charger cable i got the one with usb port then it started chargingscrew that other one it does not work pros it is fun technology i like how my ring notifications come out on my watch and it shows the video i like how i am washing my hands and it times it it is good to check your blood oxygen and heart ratebut that is it pretty much i can still control my my music like on my fit bit i do not really text people from my watch i guess that is the other benefit but other than that nothing really amazing about it i did not get cellular you do not need it if you always have your phone near by it connected to my phone quick i miss my fitbit though the only sad part,battery
86,i would not give this watch up for anything i have afib and i am able to check when i have episodes tonight i took a hard fall and i was greatjul to be able to stop the alarm i was just barely ok,screen
87,i was in need of an updated watch my old one was a series 2 and just was not working well anymore so happy i got the 7 i absolutely love it 100percent recommend getting,screen
88,my watch charges at night so i can not take advantage of the sleep tracking,screen
89,this is my first apple watch i bought it for the health apps to track heart rate and rhythm on the second day wearing it i had a major cardiac event that included svts and afib my pulse was accurately tracked compared to the medical equipment at the hospital the afib detection worked accurately but only when my heart rate was around 100 bpm or lower see the second picture when my heart rate was 101 it did not detect the afib even though the machine in the hospital did,screen
90,battery life lasts less than 1 day without using many functions ons,battery
91,product was as described delivered a day late would recommend but the shipping needs to tighten up,others
92,first i love the color i had another brand fitness watch that i really liked but this one is awesome and i love it it has all the amenities and syncs to my iphone perfectly there is only one thing i think needs improvement the battery life i have found myself recharging the watch more often than desired,battery
93,amazing watch i bought it from amazon warehouse works great pristine condition i was able to purchase apple care too i got the stainless steel with dark cherry band looks so pretty,strap
94,it is extremely irritating that apple will send you a dollar400 watch with absolutely no way to charge it it is so exhausting how they keep changing things like this to force you to buy new accessories they did not bother to include the required usb c power adapter with the watch something that almost no one actually has so you need to shell out another dollar20 and hope your watch with horrendous battery life does not die before you can get one either give us a power cord you can plug into a standard usb driver or give us an adapter with a usb c plug this is really ridiculous,battery
95,watch is very versatile and looks great easy to use and an abundance of info be careful our first box was missing the actual watch and one band seems like the seals were broken amazon replaced immediately,strap
96,i am upgrading from a series 1 so it is a completely different watch i am very satisfied with this purchase most of the heart monitoring functions only work with people older than 22 which is frustrating for me especially since i paid for the watch so i should get access to all the features nonetheless i really like the starlight apple watch and band it is very subtle and nice to look at hopefully braided solo loops get a sale soon bc i really would like one it is a pain that they do not give power bricks but this is the new age i highly suggest you purchase many usb c power bricks and switch all cords from usb a to usb c anker has great ones and you can always find deals for them,strap
97,love my new apple watch somehow makes me be less busy with my phone,screen
98,i am a first time apple anything owner this watch pairs very well with my 13 pro it has a ton of features,others
99,i orderd new apples series 7 but when received the package i could not turn it on and it is could not received charging power what i should do,others
100,she loves it we are not a tech family and she had it figured out in no time we got the gps and the distance it works from the phone is very impressive,others
101,i liked that there are more choices for backgrounds and i really like the meditation reminders too i use those everyday the new health add ons are what i was looking for the most,others
102,its like having most of the features of an iphone on your wrist so it is convenient you can receive calls answer texts too hate the battery if turn you on always on it lasts barely a day i can stretch it out to 2 days with only the necessary features apps still worth it once you get used to the daily charging,battery
103,awesome watch charges faster than previous versions more or display area,screen
104,love apple watches as soon as i saw the larger face on the series 7 i had to upgrade tons of watch face options as well definitely recommend and can not beat with dollar50 off,screen
105,love the product 100percent you know what you getting already i just like the fact there is options like these used ones but really it is just small damage on the box,others
106,i love this watch when i am working out i can track my heart rate blood oxygen ecg time spend on each exercise etc i am getting more use out of it in my day to day than i ever thought i would the only real downside is the battery life when using all the features you need to charge it once a day minimally and it takes an hour and a half or so to charge which is not horrible but i wish i had a little more time between charges i am giving it 5 stars anyway because it is so useful in every other way,battery
107,wonderful watch easy to use and setups,screen
108,i thought watches were outdated until i bought a fit bit for fitness tracking in less than a year my desire grew for more fitness data and i added swimming to my routine i bought an apple watch series 3 exactly 3 years ago loved it passed it onto my daughter and upgraded to the 7 series i absolutely love these watches the 7 is easier to use if that is even possible and the battery life is much much better than my 3 if you are a first time buyer or looking to upgrade i highly suggest this one,battery
109,"the watch is incredible I have to admit and it is beautiful, I pay the bill by approximation see if your bank is compatible it is very focused on health issues it monitors heart rate oxygenation in the end it is a very quality device but think twice before buying because it is very expensive see if it's really worth it for you",others
110,It connects easily to your iPhone. What I love most about this watch is that it helps me with my low blood pressure. It tells me every time I'm in my anxieties and tells me how much my heart rate is.,others
111,the watch battery dies in 10 minutes i had apple watch before and this is not the norm i left it charging overnight and still low battery even when i got a new charger,battery
112,the recipient loved the watch he is happy i am happy too,others
113,love the watch battery dies fast so i have to charge it and then i forget to put it back on,battery
114,when i bought this apple watch series 7 was out of stock almost everywhere but amazon had it in stock with free overnight delivery and it was dollar30 off retail price it arrived well packed in its original unopened box and in perfect condition i have been very happy with the watch and the graphite milanese loop band,strap
115,resisted buying one for couple of years at 79 i decided to give in i did add cellular services exercise walking without having to carry iphone is great all the health features are too numerous to mention but i use them daily charges in 45 minutes highly recommended,screen
116,i just upgraded from a s3 and to be honest i have a hard time finding the improvements the screen because of the rolled edges and the way text kind of rolls off the side looks strange and gives the impression your using a 3rd party app that was not designed for your system but you are not it is apple the ecg system is honestly the only reason i bought the watch and love that feature if you do not need the ecg stay with the se or s6 as that one does not utilize the rolled edges,screen
117,i liked the watch overall and use it to avoid using my cell at some times during the day like work etc,screen
118,the battery of my apple watch drains very fast did adjustment did not help may be watch is deflective thinking to return back to amazon,battery
119,love it note this watch keeps me up to date it's stylish with a leather strap and you'll look great with any outfit,strap
120,"the watch is very beautiful and has several functions for health monitoring as a whole, it must be charged daily but the recharge is very fast",others
121,love the color choices battery lasts a lot longer have not used the sleep tracking feature but really like the blood monitoring feature,battery
122,only the battery could last longer,battery
123,best watch ever king if kings no issues so far,screen
124,this watch has literally everything you can imagine setup was easy except the ecg which i have not done yet will need to google it i do not understand the griping about missing block really you have an apple watch with an a but not a c if you do not have the block just purchase a couple of converters for dollar7 and plug into c,screen
125,can not believe i waited this long to get an i watch,screen
126,this is my very 1st apple watch and so i got the gps version because i did not know if i would like it or not or really use it and now i am happy i ordered this i find myself using this for everything now and almost never take my phone out of my pocket when i am out on the go i can read all my facebook messages and my text messages form the watch although one thing i do not like is that when i get the message it pops up the message on the watch as soon as i get it so others can read it if you do not look right away and read or clear it from notifications think it may be a setting or something that could be fixed with an update but have not really looked at all the settings on the watch yet just used it as is after setting up,others
127,it is a watch lol what more do you want alright let is see screen is great scratch resistant but not impervious which is fine great product you can talk to your watch for calls just like power rangers what more do you need lol the box that it comes in is worth it too love the box presentation love it one big flaw does not seem to want to work with amazon music guess apple company does not quite like its competitors but it will connect to pandora lol,screen
128,seems to be a great watch so far but really wish they would have included an ac adapter for the usb c wall plug,screen
129,this was a great christmas present my significan not other really enjoys to wear the watch the original band that comes with it is also small enough for people with very slim spindly antenna like wrists to wear comfortably it has many nice features including weirdly enough a strange ability to read how much oxygen is in your blood that has something to do with lights and colors and sounds and the feeling of being on a giant rock that is moving through space at incredible speeds you are alive look up look up i see you now you look nice take care of yourself enjoy this product by apple goodbye,strap
130,i really like the series 7 apple watch many improvements over the series 3 that was a good watch too the watch face choices seem to go on and on the 41mm size seems to fit me better than the 38mm the extra features are really nice you can read all about them when you go to apple website i got the blue watch matches my new blue iphone12 took 4 days to receive it guess this is a very busy time of year if you are a fan of apple watches then you will love the series 7,others
131,i upgraded from an apple watch 3 to this and it is much better i love the larger screen and the ecg and pulse ox functions,screen
132,battery could have been better,battery
133,after years of using pebble and amazfit watches i decided to go apple watch because of the heart monitoring features and solid support for my ios devices phone tablet the watch works great getting it setup with my iphone 12 pro was just a non event it worked instantly the display is amazing just gorgeous the reaction time with using the screen crown or button is instant no lag at all the only issue i have is the battery i never went to apple watch before series 7 because 24 or less hours of battery life and having to carry a custom charging base everywhere i got is just untenable series 7 docs state even with always on display the average is a goal of 18 hours ha i am lucky to get 10 or 12 and it does not even do much during the day i have tested others like several android watches over the years too and none were this consumptive of battery the sleep tracking works fine but it is not comfortable to wear in bed all night i do not think any band is overall i like it i will use it it works super well with my iphone and the apps are great but honestly if i had known the battery life was this short with average usage i would have probably gone with another amazfit or the pebble based fitbit versa 3,battery
134,great product and great battery life even though it stays on all the time wish mine did,battery
135,i received this watch yesterday today i needed to re charge the battery guess what the charging cable does not fit into any of my apple charging adapters i called amazon and was told that the adapter does not come with the apple watch the charging adapter must be bought separately are you kidding me what a rip off,battery
136,the screen is bigger and easier to read than series 5 I had a negative point the jadlog carrier made delivery a day late,screen
137,i gifted the watch to my girlfriend for her birthday this month and she is enjoying it already she is really into fitness and health aspect of the watch she is having fun exploring the other features as well call texting ect,others
138,love my new gold stainless watch delivery was extremely fast ordered on 10 21 and it was delivered in 10 24,others
139,i love my apple watch the things it can do i have afib and the ekg feature is priceless 5 stars for sure,screen
140,i had changed my apple watch series 6 series 7 has much longer life time and bigger screen which was crucial for me with my 45mm version recommend everyone to purchase if you are into tracking your sleep fitness and other activities,screen
141,this watch does everything you can imagine it is great,screen
142,i unfortunately am allergic to something in the watch i unfortunately had to stop wearing it after only three days due to an allergic reaction probably due to the nickel in the watch as for the battery for a watch that cost as much as it does it should last more than a day to a day and a half,battery
143,wonderful item battery very perfect drops after 24 hrs,battery
144,i like the size and it has help up pretty decent the battery life is not as good as competing products i,battery
145,had an apple watch to and thought i was going to notice a big difference going from my apple watch seven the screen scratches just like the older models apps run the same disappointed but life goes on save your money,screen
146,this is my second apple watch my first one was great so i decided to purchase a second one within a month of having the watch the wrist strap broke i reached out to apple and it seemed like i was going to get a new band free of charge that was not the case they billed me and have not reimbursed me i have had multiple conversations with apple without resolution i have been waiting since 2 22 for a reimbursement very disappointed with the service especially with crystal the supervisor i spoke with,strap
147,lots more info and options than the under dollar100 fitness watches really enjoying fitness workout options doubt i will ever go back to a lesser model battery life is not what i had hoped expected requires a daily charge fortunately it is a rapid recharge as far as accuracy often does not recognize that i am standing and have been for several hours simply because my arms are not moving enough while working at my standing desk it does provide notice though so i can flap my arms and achieve my rings good motivation overall it is a lot of money compared to other fitness watches but it is worth it,battery
148,the screen alone beats all else once somebody gets to see the screen of the watch the thirst is filled the biggest feature is the screen of the watch i picked it up frequently to look at it and then put it away,screen
149,it is a great watch i used fitbit samsung and some cheaper watches but all were a waste compared to this watch love how it integrates with my phone and reminds me to get off my butt all day long as a heart patient it monitors many things i need to keep an eye on like heart rate blood oxygen lever and so much more through the health app glad i finally bit the bullet and made this purchase a little disappointed in battery life compared to other products can not use the sleep monitoring benefits as i have to charge it every night love having mickey mouse on it so i can just tell people i got a mickey mouse watch,battery
150,just got watch the other day have been reading up on them for several months and decided to finally purchase one really like the health features i was going in for some test and told my doctor about the new watch and he said it would help with us staying in contact with vitals that he wants to track cool,others
151,phone although in new condition i have to question its longevity the charger cord that was sent for one is not and apple charger its a samsung charger you only receive part of charger you do not even get the c port just a useless cord actually made for another product this was dollar400 wasted not to mention my time   i honestly expected what i was paying for yes,others
152,the charger does not work at all it worked one time out of the box i just got this watch jan 31st so you would think the charger would work more than just one day i am really perturbed which is a nice way of saying i am so p o would i might send the whole thing back along with the ones i got for my husband and son except their chargers work,others
153,watch arrived on time as promised easy to use,screen
154,watch works as it should i have now track my sleep and have done better with getting sleep,screen
155,uuuh received my package and opened and both boxes the watch and band were completely empty be aware,strap
156,i love everything about this watch just brought an apple watch coming from samsung and by far apple is winning this watch here is a very good buy,others
157,this concept of my phone on my wrist is very cool opted for cellular model for physical safety might not always be real close to my phone,strap
158,what can you say it is an apple watch which is pretty much perfection nothing not to love about it,screen
159,battery does not last,battery
160,wife loves the blue color and size of her series 7 41mm it seems faster and better than my series 5,screen
161,the watch pleasantly surprised me the battery lasts all day and charges super fast really good,battery
162,i had the apple watch series 6 and hated how short the battery would work this one is battery lasts way longer a lot quicker to charge item was as described amazing resolution i love everything about this watch honestly super simple to install and start using i believe it took me 30 mins tops i love how it is way more accurate on my sleep heart rate and all my movements and stats my issue with series 6 is it was not accurate as well and would not track my sleep no matter how much troubleshooting i did this one i have my sleep tracked on here and way better application overall i highly recommend this watch for people wanting something to have that does so much more than other watches and has a iphone so they are connected all day long i am so happy to get this for christmas and will never look back,battery
163,i like the bigger screen it is easier for me to type to reply to messages i wish the battery life was improved to at least 5 days however there is not much upgrade to features compared to my friend is 6 but i love the shade of blue and the rounded corners if you have series 5 or older go for the upgrade,screen
164,it arrived without the original apple packaging,others
165,with all the iphone functions turned off this watch loses 20percent of its charge each day just sitting and doing nothing itself,battery
166,i previously had a fitbit and loved it decided to upgrade to an apple watch was very upset to open the box and not find a charging cube since the charger has a type c end on it you need a special plug cube i did not have any so was not able to use my watch until i purchased an adapter or charging station for the cost of the series 7 apple should include the cubes or at least an adapter battery life is terrible only 18 24 hrs hard to track sleeping when you have to charge so often,battery
167,the best watch ever,screen
168,love this watch only two detractors kept it from getting all 5 stars one had to wait to change the watch for several days since it did not come with a usb c plug in two was there were no directions on how to hook the band i have never had anything like the one that came with it and i put it on wrong and it kept falling off thank heavens i have a young niece to explain how to use it,strap
169,i liked that i can track my o2 level and sleep,screen
170,this is my first apple watch i bought it from apple and i love it still learning all it has to offer i am disappointed however in the display this series is touted to be more rugged than previous series i am not that rough and after less than 2 months i already have 2 large scratches see picture at first i had a plastic film on it but once i got active moisture accumulated underneath there are were no covers available plus i did not want to add bulk to the already large display of course the warranty does not cover this eventually i will use my applecare to replace it,screen
171,worst in it is battery length i think amazfit and fitbit are far far better than this,battery
172,only pain i had was the initial setup apple watch is simply superb strong battery life easy to use,battery
173,the battery should have been more durable,battery
174,glad i ordered this off amazon it works perfectly and i have zero complaints by the way it is my first apple watch,screen
175,the battery wears out too soon,battery
176,watch already well known expensive but does not disappoint for what it promises store sold right everything original and working well arrived faster than the maximum term much cheaper than in physical stores,others
177,i loved my new apple watch series 7 the green color is very nice and the big screen it is noticeable,screen
178,wifey loves it there is a learning curve though deal with it,others
179,the sleep tracking do not satisfied me at all and so do the battery life i have a mi band 6 and while it loses 7percent the apple watch loses 43percent i am not kidding this is insane,battery
180,the watch is amazing brand new just make sure that your phone is updated to the last update available so that the pairing process is quick easy,screen
181,i love this watch it is a good size and the stock band feels nice i am not on my phone as much since getting it i had an amazon gift card so i used it for this watch after having it i would not pay the price since i am just not a watch guy but i do like it and glad i got it if price is not an issue i would definitely would get it,strap
182,wife loves it super cool model and very advance crazy what these things can do and how in tune with yourself you become she works on her feet a lot so this watch has made so many things phonewise easier,others
183,"The product complies with the characteristics, the colors and brightness are great, the battery continues to be a must for Apple compared to other competitors, it lasts approx. 48 hours with its charge and regarding monitoring, it complies with the basics.",battery
184,i do not know how to use this watch it is smarter than i am,screen
185,love my new watch i ordered the extra wristbands and change them to match what i am wearing or just to match my mood,strap
186,i absolutely love my watch only bad is battery do not last but one day,battery
187,the older i get the more i rely on my apple watch to track all my health issues so when i go to the doctor i have a good report of my body to present to him i can pull my activity counts average heartrate run an ekg and more it even tells him how much i am hydrating if i take a fall the watch detects and asks if it should call for help it tells me when i have been watching my televised story programs too long and need to stand up and move and also tracks how well i am sleeping the bigger screen on this model is also helpful to my failing eyes,screen
188,perfect gift for our daughter green is a great color,others
189,"the apple watch works very well, fluid navigation and several applications to access the seller is mega attentive and responds quickly",screen
190,my mom loves it will use it to track heart rate and oxygen level,strap
191,i upgraded from a series 4 apple watch i like the always on display and the added blood oxygen measurement other than that it does not do much of anything that the older watch does not do but imo it is enough to justify the upgrade fwiw the slightly larger display is not at all obvious is it a little bigger yes but if i was not told beforehand i would never have noticed,screen
192,this was a brand new apple watch series 7 many people rated this item very low because it did not come with a usb c adapter but it was already mentioned in the description of the product that apple was not providing adapters anymore the low reviews made me nervous about the package coming in but i was very happy and satisfied with this watch ps this is my first one i have ever owned,others
193,this apple watch does not support kt cellular in the region apple watch can only be used with cellular plans that are certified by your carrier i live in south korea and as soon as i turn on this watch this is what i get what a disappointment,screen
194,went from a series 2 to a series 7 i love my new watch,screen
195,love the apple watch keeps track of exercise messages emails and everything you need,screen
196,ordering and receiving went fine i am disappointed with the watch though i just switched from fitbit to the apple watch 7 and had an expectation that i would be able to configure my watch face how i wanted i want to have my step count on the face and i want to see my current heart rate not what it was 7 minutes ago those two things make me think my purchase was wrong and i should have stayed with fitbit my two other major disappointments are with the battery life my fitbit had a 5 7 day battery life and not coming with the brick i had already upgraded my phone so i knew there would not be a charging brick and cable but still very disappointed i have only had my watch for 3 days but am not sure if i made the right decision or if i will go back to fitbit so disappointed,battery
197,the watch is great the battery should last a little longer the screen is very beautiful and the finish is impeccable I recommend it,screen
198,battery life is great i have a pretty active day 8 5 10 hours and use it for music i charge it maybe once in the afternoon and do not have to charge it again until midday the next day,battery
199,not brand new it is not an unopened box plastic wrapping is missing and microfractures on the screen the first package picture was not apple freshly wrapped the box was opened the plastic was ripped off of it and there are microfractures on the screen now the replacement package video has arrived and is also not apple freshly wrapped the plastic seal is nonexistent and the box is opened on one side now i am expected to go without the watch i paid for by returning my first one along with the replacement one then wait for a refund then purchase another one then pray that it is actually new still wrapped in apple is plastic seal then wait for that to arrive still all that equates to massive inconvenience multiplied by the loss of my prime time divided by every dime of mine stuck in limbo simplifies to being filled with hope that just maybe this time i will receive a brand new apple watch as advertised guess i will give the dice another roll maybe third times the charm so fingers crossed folks,screen
200,truly overhyped and started having issues with it not even 3 days into having it spotify stopped syncing and many of the features were not working tried to use it to track my boxing workout and it kept ending work out on its own so it did not measure anything save your money go with fitbit or something cheaper because this is not worth it,screen
201,very good performance and screen quality,screen
202,it is a very nice looking watch that is so easy to use going for a walk run or bike ride it is easy to start recording the event battery life is about the biggest downfall it definitely has to be charged every day,battery
203,absolutely no complaints got the watch it is been amazing can not imagine my routine without it after only about a week could not imagine not having it,screen
204,really easy to set up only issue i have is the battery drains fairly fast i love it so far,battery
205,great watch does everything i need it to do,screen
206,it is a great watch but i sent it back but on refund,screen
207,watch was a gift and she loved it,screen
208,provides the ability to respond to text msgs without taking out my phone,screen
209,the battery only lasts 1 day,battery
210,purchased larger screen for husband who does not see well he has no problem seeing the screen,screen
211,exactly as described,screen
212,i used my apple watch to monitor for heart arrhythmias and blood oxygen saturation levels it works great for this purpose it is just fun that i can check the weather text messages and so much more,screen
213,best watch yet love it,screen
214,i wear it all the time sleep tracker is amazing and the activity rings are accurate,strap
215,there are several glitches in the watch first i do not know why you would monitor you sleep unless you want to take the watch off in the morning to charge it batter life is only a 30hours so it does half way through the day the heath monitoring is constantly glitches it does not count your workouts towards your daily goal unless you recalibrate regularly you only get to monitor you cardiac fitness once even with recalibration to get rid of the unnecessary apple apps on the watch you have to delete them off the iphone recommend waiting for another generation or two,battery
216,i love the watch every thing works on it like it should the only complaint i have is the battery life but it is a fairly quick charge,battery
217,my watch wont charge after the latest update i am using third party chargers that all worked before the update i can not afford dollar30 for the oem chargers because i would need several of them,others
218,purchased this as used from amazon it is in perfect condition no scratches or anything great price for a basically new watch green band purchased separately,strap
219,the wall charger does not come complete,others
220,this is my second apple watch and this is 2 5 months old and three times it has gotten warm and then will not hold a charge for more than a couple of hours i am completely frustrated as it feels like i have no recourse,battery
221,for now i have to give this a 1 star not for the watch itself but because the package i received did not contain the watch it was pre opened and stolen when i received it when i get the replacement i will be be happy to leave a new review,others
222,go to a store it came broken dirty and the band did not even work please please do not buy off amazon they are amazing in other areas but not apple,others
223,i gave this to my son and he loved it it looks great with work attire as well as casual he loves all the features this gift was very well received,others
224,the watch is sleek beautiful very responsive and works wonders when filled with juice but that is the thing battery barely lasts 24 hours ex i charged yesterday at 7 pm did not use for anything else but to watch the time my sleep track if actually off so it is not like the watch is working extra during the night rn is noon and i have 46percent battery and still have 7 hours to go for the full 24 hrs so yeah very disappointed with the battery life my coworker have a series 5 and he told me it lasts 2 days no problem so i am really bummed on this regard,battery
225,good watch for fans of the brand,screen
226,love the neutral band looks dressy and more professional or appropriate for a wedding,others
227,this watch is amazing was a christmas gift from my husbandhe did really good excellent product,others
228,the packaging it was horrible as i opened the watch it fell out the box it was no secured in the box and no band what kind of advertising is that,strap
229,watch is great it replaced my series 5 this is the first time i bought an apple product with applecare on amazon and will probably be the last they never notified apple of my applecare purchase i had to contact apple on the phone and rectify it thankfully apple contacted amazon to resolve it apple rep this is not unusual with amazon amazon should not sell applecare if they can not do it correctly,others
230,the apple watch 7 is nice especially if you are upgrading from a version that is several years old but beware it only comes with a charger that is usb c so if you do not already have a usb power brick or old watch charger you have to buy that and will not be able to charge your watch,screen
231,this is my 2nd apple watch after a watch version 1 i love the larger size and oxygen monitor,screen
232,if the actual watch itself was in there i would have been thrilled but opening the box to see a band and a charger was extremely disappointing after i paid dollar400,strap
233,i love this watch,screen
234,i am so happy with this purchase my apple watch is excellent and i received it after 2 days of placing my order,screen
235,i like everything about this watch accept the battery life is poor,battery
236,it is the best smart watch you can buy although if you do not have an iphone i think you will not enjoy it as much as i do,others
237,for now everything grade 10 the product arrived as promised and in the picture seller grade 10 also the watch arrived before the delivery deadline I'm loving it I recommend everyone to buy,screen
238,too read data from my iphone and the pop up news head lines,screen
239,excellent same product as u buy it in the store or official website but way cheaper,others
240,there is no secret as new smartwatches keep joining the battle it is still apple who keeps winning the race workout tracking steps heart rate ecg blood oxigen unlocking your iphone and mac without face id or passcode apple pay notifications for all apps on your wrist etc it is a very cool gadget to have very useful and very functional to me the only down side is still the battery there are other smartwatches that beat the apple watch big time on battery so it makes you wonder what does apple need to create a watch with a battery that lasts as least a couple of days aside from the battery which to me only represents the hastle of putting the watch on the charger for about an hour the charging is super fast now there is nothing else to complain about i picked the aluminum red one with the standard silicone band and i absolutely love it,battery
241,i love this new apple watch it loses battery super quick though even when i turned off the always on screen at the end of the day it usually ends up on 30percent which isnt that bad but idk,battery
242,love this watchstylish and the new features are wonderful so happy i got it,others
243,does everything that it says and the display is even better than advertised i did not have any iphone watches before the series 7 but i know i can not live without this now i have a health condition and it allows me to give my doctor additional information to help me feel better,screen
244,first time owning a smart watch after reading all the reviews went with the 7 does everything that i wanted and then some have not tried the sleep tracking yet,screen
245,needed some form of contact since i am living alone so i linked my iwatch to my daughter is so she can make sure i am still moving around plus it has a help i have fallen feature all other products need you to push a button for help if you are passed out or dead that is kind of difficult to do,screen
246,wow that was fast 24 hours after purchase had apple watch series 7 on my wrist upon unboxing the watch face displayed low battery i put it on the charger and it was 3 4 charged in less than 15 minutesi had to download and install the latest updates this process took a little longer than i had expected after watching other reviews that questioned the authenticity of their purchase product of course i was a little nervous going into such a large purchase however this is absolutely apple you can feel it and see it in the packaging before you even get to the good stuff i think that it is important to mention that i did purchase the apple care package for dollar79 perhaps that ensures the authenticity of what you were purchasing just a thought i can not wait to start closing those exercise rings and earning those spinning medallions happy apple girl correction in the last clip of the video i said 40 mm obviously it is 45 mm,battery
247,love this thing had been wanting an apple watch for a while and finally made the purchase arrived super quick,screen
248,i have been wanting an apple watch and finally purchased one i was a little leary with the battery life only being 18 hours but it actually lasts for more than 24 hours i fully charge my watch each day because i wear it to bed and it only gets down to about 40percent by the time i charge it again the calling and texting from the watch is awesome if you have been on the fence about getting one then get off it and buy one,battery
249,i considered buying a used apple watch a couple years ago because the current watch at the time did not seem to do much more than the older watches then the 7 was going to come out with always on feature and larger screen which for me was the thing i wanted i am so far loving it the ability to switch between always on faces means it can go from looking like an elegent watch plain artistic face to utilitarian with a swipe the added health features are a bonus although i do not really need them i could see those features being very handy for an older user that is trying to monitor changes to heart rate o2 saturation etc,screen
250,i was super excited to receive the newer version of the apple watch as it was a huge upgrade from my apple 3 when i got it the thin card board box not the shipping box it came in was torn in a couple spots and it was also missing the band it was supposed to come with so i returned super disappointed,strap
251,apple watch series 7 is a great purchase easy to use and sync and has a wide variety of features,screen
252,i switched from a fitbit to an apple watch and i am in love i love that my phone and apps seamlessly pair with the watch and i can get notifications even when i am not attached at the hip to my phone i am still not completely sold on the phone but the watch has sold me on itself it did not come with a charging block just the cord but it seems like that is standard i had one on hand so i was not worried it also did take time to get it connected but i had to update the phone is operating system first overall very impressed so far in spite of the little issues at the start,others
253,it drains battery so easily can not even last a day maybe it is a defective product planning to return it,battery
254,reliable watch full of technology and looks good,screen
255,the quality is in every detail the battery lasts as promised if I use it well during the day I charge it overnight or the next morning very good for notifications and whatsapp calendar calendar until slack they all arrive for running or gym and top to the pool it was also possible to download spotify sounds on it and leave the phone at home,battery
256,i have been using this apple watch for a year and highly recommend it,screen
257,the band is not starlight like the picture shows it is an ugly beige no power adapter for the magnetic charger so i can not even charge it should come with the adapter,strap
258,"the watch arrived within the promised time with invoice and everything as indicated in the ad the product is very good it is very worth it the only negative point I have noticed so far is the battery that lasts a maximum of 2 days but use for exercises and with medication pulse rate, which consumes a lot of battery charge and is super fast so this is not a problem at all, just praise for the product",battery
259,i was disappointed in the color of the band i thought it looked like pearly white,strap
260,i am very happy with my beautiful apple watch easy to handle many functions,screen
261,i have had the other generation of apple watches i only got this one because my gen 5 screen cracked all the heck now i do not feel much difference in the 7 from my 5 beyond the larger screen the 7 feels about the same weight is not much different,screen
262,nice battery life is still short,battery
263,it is certainly bold the red i am going from green pink and now red i so happy i did this is just beautifully made feature rich and quality,others
264,i like all future of this apple watch,others
265,i ordered this watch at least 25 days ago finally got it today and made a surprise to my wife she definitely loves this watch it works very smoothly and also very cute design i am glad i picked right color the starlight color perfectly matched her,others
266,first of all it took me about six hours to get this apple watch to work and a sync with my phone that is number one then i had it maybe three days so i look back in history and i thought i was paying for a new one and i see information from january 2022 that is not right so i am sending it back and i am gonna go to the apple store and get mine,screen
267,the brightness of the screen is the same as series 5 or at least to my eyes the more disappointing feature is the milanese band quality is not same as the series 5 one i have the series 7 band kinks quite often my series 5 band is constructed much better with a smooth jewel like feel,screen
268,i like it i have wanted one for years and bit the bullet works well for tracking workout activity receiving notifications messages changing selecting music without needing to pull out my phone battery lasts around a day and a half you should plan on having to charge it every day i would say problem you literally cannot charge your watch out of the box if you do not have a usbc charging block i own no devices that utilize this i had to shell out more money after spending dollar350 on this watch this is unacceptable i would understand if there was no charging block for a normal usb plug in everyone has one laying around,battery
269,the watch does everything it promises to do the battery goes all day and still has life left when i go to bed even when the outdoor walk is used the heart monitor has come in handy on several occasions all in all it was well worth purchasing,battery
270,It has served me very well I can use many applications and the battery lasts a long time,battery
271,first of all it took forever to set up then i was trying to set up the heart monitor an hour later found out u have to be 22 to use it the band on this watch is useless slips easy this thing is going back and i will stick with my series 5 then i am going to by an android phone so i can be free of apple,strap
272,very dissapointed i took the watch out the box and set it up the battery died and when i put it to charge it never charged so either the battery or the charger not working after i spent so much money on it,battery
273,beautiful watch,screen
274,i almost had the same issue with verizon not supporting this watch the verizon store told me it was not compatible and that it was defective amazon gave me the runaround as well as apple i logged into the apple watch app and was able to activate it there on verizon,others
275,excellent smart watch with blood pressure measure sleek design and quickly sync with the phone i wish it had a longer battery life like they improved the battery of latest iphones however over all 10 10 for performance design and functionality,battery
276,i was debating between and 41 and 44mm watch i am very happy with the 41mm the notifications and awards for moving is incredibly motivating i love that you get to connect and compete with friends keeps you super accountable to get your daily movement and steps in highly recommend for anyone thinking about getting one of these gadgets really fun to play with,screen
277,"arrived with 3 working days from the moment I placed the order, it comes packing with all the accessories that match the description, I bought the 41mm because I looked at the comments before buying and I imagined that the 45mm would be big on my wrist and it fit super well battery lasts about 1 and a half days",battery
278,it took half a day to set up i had to leave it with my iphone within range of wifi and connected to chargers while i downloaded a long series of updates and performed a long series of restarts the battery life is about 18 hours so i need to take it off to charge while i sleep this makes it difficult to use as a sleep monitor and use it as a watch all day the watch is not very useful without being always linked to my iphone now i have to have bluetooth on my iphone always on which sucks battery life also the watch iphone combo made the decision for me that my iphone alerts are now silent and the watch will tap my wrist for alerts after missing a couple appointments i had to disconnect the watch by turning off bluetooth i searched through the hundreds of settings and could not find the one where i gave permission to make decisions about iphone settings without my consents apple does not include power supplies anymore and they switched all there power cords to a new connector so i can not use the 10 old power supplies i have sitting in a drawer seems like a cash grab i guess they are out of ideas for new useful products that would increase sales,battery
279,works great with everything i wanted wish the battery lasted longer worth the buy,battery
280,apple products are excellent the watch is great I was just disappointed with the oximeter that checks blood oxygen levels it practically doesn't work just the error I was disappointed with this functionality because I bought it for this differential,others
281,loud and clear on phone calls and i love the mindfulness and breathing app,screen
282,bought this as a gift for my wife she will not wear it with the existing strap everytime she hits an object with her wrist the strap pops open and she is afraid to use it,strap
283,love the health trackers on this watch,screen

289,the battery goes out quickly,battery
290,well it is good to have the watch for the ease to answer texts when phone is in pocket pretty much for what i use it for coming from a garmin 245 love the battery on that watch for sure battery on apple watch is very under performing compared to garmin,battery
291,the watch comes with two bands one is too small the other is too big i lost my watch the first time i wore it not happy,strap
292,a great watch good quality good battery heath 100percent but i think it is a bit expensive for what you can really do with it of course we are paying for the brand that is apple but i think the se would be a very good cheaper option and with practically the same functions,battery
293,my first apple watch,screen
294,this is excellent as watch but health features are great,screen
295,all of the above,others
296,nice one but the battery drains once it is not being charged whether it is worn or not thus it has to be continuously charged 24 7 not a good one,battery
297,this is a great smart watch it is very useful and keeps you updated even your not beside your phone it helps me maintain my daily exercise and health app this is the best smart watch and i recommend it its a bet expensive but it comes into clutch anywhere anytime,screen
298,got this watch at least 6 weeks before apple could ship it product is great,screen

303,nice watch in stainless steel only wish it came with the xl band i had to get at the apple store,strap
304,i had an older one almost 5 years old and so i knew i would love it with this one i got a bigger screen totally worth it everything about the new one is great if you are thinking about one trust me it is worth it i use it for the workout features and keeping me from sitting too much also to set timers and reminders leave your phone in the other room no problem text from your watch talk on the phone too it is like an 70s kid is now in the jetson is,screen
305,love it it looks great i am upgrading from a series 4 44 mm which i traded back to apple the pulse ox is a nice feature the screen is larger the usb c charges very fast the problem with apple watches is the battery life should last longer i have not tested how long it would last but i would guess 2 days with minimal usage 1 day with daily use,battery
306,100percent genuine apple watch this replaced my series 4 love the green case color highly recommend,screen
307,the watch is in like new condition but it is locked by another apple user and will take up to 30 days for apple to reset the password if possible i have tried contacting the company and can speak to no one there so i am returning it,others
308,i had a series 3 that i had for a few years now i decided to upgrade to the latest and greatest i was not sure which size but i decided i like bigger and hoped it would not look too big on my little wrist it does not i love this watch it works perfect i wish the battery lasted a bit longer but i guess with all its doing it is not bad i get about a day and half from the battery,battery
309,the watch was pretty much what i have come to expect with apple the only downside is the battery life my wife has to charge it daily and she is not running any of the apps,battery
310,disappointed in the battery life my samsung would last 4 days this one two at best,battery
311,spend dollar499 and you do not get a usb charging power block the manual is too small to read for old eyes and lacking complete setup directions,others
312,my old watch broke i upgraded from a series 3 to the 7 and dang the difference is incredible the screen is amazing and the new app selections are really cool it only took a few minutes to get it all set up so it was super simple,screen
313,not sure why there was no protective plastic film like apple normally uses looks like it was opened before and later resealed with stickers on the edges neatly nothing is wrong with my watch that i received thus far but it would be nice to have some clarification on why mines was not fully sealed also i did not realize that apple does not include the whole charger set for this watch i had to order one separately and it took two days through amazon to arrive so if you plan on using this right away i would get the charger first,others
314,very light resistant and with a great battery with fast charging the best smartwatch I know,battery
315,i bought new one and band is not fitting the watch,strap
316,watch is great it does take a little bit to learn but it does work as advertised watch does have a lower battery life but think that it has more to do with the charger then it does the watch,battery
317,i wish i could have bought it for me i purchased a series 6 apple watch for me earlier this year and this one i bought for my best friend it looks similar to series 6 but the added features are really great in series 7 larger full screen with a better battery life is really awesome and i got it in a pretty good deal the price is similar to that of series 6,screen
318,apple once again demonstrates their total disdain for the consumer after waiting for the watch to finally arrive surprise apple does not send the watch with a power block to allow you to charge the thing but wait you can purchase one from apple for additional cost and then wait for that item to arrive i am one customer waiting for the karma bus to roll all over apple,others
319,i had an old apple watch second gen i also had the amazfit smart watch finally decided to upgrade my apple watch to the 7 series the display is clear and has more options it is lighter than the older model and i love the multiple face options i can have one for work one for the gym,screen
320,my wife was a bit tepid on putting on her new iwatch 7 but now she loves it,screen
321,it is pure bs that you can spend almost dollar500 for a watch and it does not come with an accessory needed to charge it not even a heads up from amazon that you need to buy it i may send it back,others
322,really enjoying this watch it does everything i wanted and more,screen
323,this is my second purchase of an apple watch i previously had series 4 mistakenly run over it with a lawnmower i love all the features and convenience of the cellular series never really used the sleep tracking because i dislike sleeping with a watch on sort of expensive however it is worth the price for me excellent buy thanks,others
324,the item works fine lots of great features for sure however there were a couple of issues that make this product over priced the first disappointment was that it only comes with half a charger luckily my wife already had a charger the next was that this thing really only has a days worth of battery life i have to take it off so often and forget to put it back on i bought this thing to monitor health which it does very well however i have to take it off to charge every single night which means heart health is not tracked at night for 500 plus dollars this product should come with a charger come on and it should have a better battery going to return it if i can,battery
325,great watch thanks,screen
326,battery is not as should be my other one could last 2 days this one lasts 1 but ok i charge every night anyways sometimes it zooms them self or the touchscreen does not work but most of the time is fine,battery
327,my wife is in the healthcare business and holding her phone is a no no on the floor and therefore having an iwatch is perfect in her case she loves the quality functionality and me need i say more thanks apple for making me look good,screen
328,the ios is horrible frustrating and counter intuitive want a stopwatch not on this device oh it has a stopwatch that is useless garbage after one minute the only thing it displays is 1 what genius thought of this it is not saving battery the display is still on you can raise your wrist and the numbers appear but if i have a heavy dumbbell in my hand or i am stabilizing it in my lap i can not move my wrist just have the flipping numbers on screen ffs do you want to know what minute you are on after 70 seconds tough sh the screen switches to the time so now you are forced to bring up your wrist and yes i have looked up and changed every setting possible nothing i do prevents this well why do not you download a third part app hey let is try that that was a massive headache itself and after i finally did download a third party stopwatch app that showed all of the numbers the amazing intuitive apple ios darkens and reverts to the time un flipping believable want to turn that setting off tough sh mr customer you can only look at the app for 70 seconds so screw your three minute timer peasant what you need to do is toggle the hide sensitive complications options on or off guess what that does not work not after 70 seconds while i am talking about the display sometimes an app view screen shows up randomly and i literally can not do anything to get out of it the only option i have is to turn it off and back on again that is extremely frustrating also they need to figure out which direction the scroll when is used for one screen the scroll wheel moves the screen in the direction you push the wheel up is up and down is down but when you go to move the cursor to edit text down on the wheel moves the cursor up why why would they do this well we are on the subject of text the talk to text on this watch is atrocious i can say the exact same thing on my iphone and it works great the watch simply does a turd job at understanding talk to text when i do scroll down to go up and select a word to change it to something that i actually said instead of what it wrote the options simply are not there ever also when i am on the workout app tracking my heart rate and i switch to a stopwatch app to track my time in between sets i looked down at my watch to check the time and it switched back to the workout app that is so extremely frustrating when i switch to another app i want to look at that flipping app i do not want you to change to the time i do not want you to change apps regardless of what you think i want to see it is little stuff like this that makes me want to ask will it blend sometimes i think putting it down the garbage disposal or in a vitamix would make me much happier due to the frustration i have with the ios what stops me from doing that the hardware the hardware is really amazing i love the way it feels in my wrist i love the heart rate monitor which never drops my heart rate unlike every fitbit or mio watch i have had the screen is fantastic the haptics are really nice and not overbearing for the amount that this thing cost the fact that the software is so crippling there is no way i can recommend someone purchase this until they get the ios fixed,screen
329,good product but the battery ending fast,battery
330,got it for the wife fir xmas like most apple products it is way over priced for what it is,strap
331,this is a major upgrade coming from apple watch 3 great battery life super fast processor and excellent health monitoring,battery
332,graphite stainless steel case with graphite milan really nice looking i love it,others
333,I've been an apple watch user for a long time and I've never had any complaints about making an excellent product,screen
334,excellent arrived super fast and the product was new,others
335,battery last for about a day as opposed to the fitbit iconic which lasts for 3 days,battery
336,every feature of this watch is spot on purchased for emergency sos and for gps location should i fall or otherwise need help i love the gold stainless case and the ability to have a cellular connectivity as well as pair with my iphone i have had another apple watch aluminum case and liked it very much but wanted a gold stainless case thus the reason for buying this one re sos feature i fell recently and the watch was faster at responding than my fall alert button for which i pay a monthly fee the reason i gave the watch a 4 star review is because i thought i was purchasing a new watch but in fact when it came and i placed it on the charger it became very hot and i realized the battery must be bad so i investigated further and found out it was a refurbished watch good condition am giving a 4 star review only because i am returning the watch due to battery heating up when on charge i will purchase another apple watch new this time,battery
337,great battery life and charges fast,battery
338,best apple watch ever love it,screen
339,got this to check my o2 levels and my afib and so my son knows when i fall since my balance is like a one year old is like that it connects with my phone and i can bluetooth music without exposing the phone to my cleaning or planting do not like that the apps are geared towards young athletic types we need the activity meter to have a rehab calibration and one for senior seniors over 70 completely different needs and abilities the huge boomer population is getting on and the medical aspects of this watch are helpful but there needs to be a bit more development geared towards differently abled half the icons are so small i can not tell what they are the list layout is heaven sent wish i could design my own icons because even the ones i can see are not intuitive i like the starlight color and the bigger size the warm brushed beige is flattering to aging complexions need a couple pastels or soft hues to balance the harsh dark primary colors cornflower cocoa turquoise and such still learning how to navigate the watch with my big arthritic fingers apple should design a fingertip stylus that attaches securely to the band waiting to be slipped on,screen
340,because it's practically a cell phone on your arm I thought the battery lasts a lot I use it all day and I still sleep with it original came packaged with invoice arrived 4 days before the deadline and I'm in love,battery
341,along with the watch itself they give you the charging cable but no adapter to plug it into so you are given the watch and no way to charge it and it is not a usb plug it is something completely specific to the series 7 maybe this is something you need to include instead of forcing me to buy something separately to keep the damn thing functioning now i have to wait for the adapter so if it dies until then oh well that is completely ridiculous,others
342,I already had an applewatch and I decided to exchange it for this more current model for me the product is great I would like to congratulate the seller and his service we had a little unforeseen with the carrier however this was quickly resolved by the seller who was attentive and I felt safe with the purchase at all times the delivery was super fast I recommend and I will definitely buy from this store again,others
343,the main thing is band needs to be much smaller even the smallest size is too big,strap
344,items went missing and very disappointed with this,others
345,absolutely love this watch,screen
346,the watch is great the band keeps opening not a very good latch system for this price watch,strap
347,bought as a gift love it is features and style,others
348,the new series 7 allows bigger fonts to fit within the watch face makes everything easier to see,screen
349,battery only lasts for about 22hrs and unable to track sleep which my mickey mouse watch did,battery
350,the product is original comes with invoice and very well packed in addition the seller is super reliable and the delivery is fast and tracked the watch is beautiful the screen is bigger than the previous models I loved the new color and the battery lasts a long time as long as you disable the display mode always active it's worth remembering that the charger wire that charges much faster now is with the usb c so if you don't have the adapter provide one I'm satisfied with the purchase,screen
351,my first apple watch and i am loving it new updates new faces it is really cool the apple community is really strong it is not cheap but if you use klarna or something it is literally 100 every other week enjoy,screen
352,so let me get this straight i spend dollar1000 on two brand new apple watches as gifts to only get them in and find out we have zero way to charge them  big big fail apple unbelievable,others
353,went from series 3 to series 7 love everything about it,screen
354,watch holds battery for a day and a half with constant use and is easy to set up,battery
355,glitchy temperamental slow especially with audible appcan not imagine where all these positive reviews came fromthe store was full of folks with similar challengesavoid,others
356,the product arrived quicker than anticipated very easy to set up and the product quality lives up to the apple standards of excellence i am very please with this and feel it is a good investment in a watch,others
357,my nearest best buy did not have it in stock i would have to wait a week for it to arrive and amazon had it delivered within a day i am super impressed as for the watch it is a good upgrade from my series 5 i went with the bigger screen size as well and i am in love with it,screen
358,everything was perfect but apple man i forgot they never bring in power adapters with their products just a quick little reminder most if not all apple products including this will not bring a power adapter and you have to buy one yourself,others
359,your iphone needs to be updated to at least ios 15 in order to pair it up with the series 7 apple watch,screen
360,battery life is great and i love the cellular feature,battery
361,the watch arrived with a dead battery after a three hour charge using a usb c charger which i had also purchased the watch remained charged for less than 15 minutes it is charging now overnight but surely a brand new watch battery is supposed to be a little charged then recharge easily after 4 days it now recharges fine the ecg app is extremely poor and blood oxgen is very slow compared to pulse oximeter i bought for these features apple does say not for medical purposes i am not a fitness freak i am learning to use features that require purchase of additional software that helps me pay attention to your purposes for buying this watch i hated it but have learned to use certain additional software to my benefit and am having no more battery problems so i am now pleased,battery
362,everything it is good but the charger it is bad now i need to use the charger of my iwarch3 for my new i watch 7 i am disappointed,others
363,i would have chosen another color but this was available the sports band feels like skin and is extremely comfortable i got the watch to track my health readings during sleep my cpap was under fda recall not to use so i was monitoring my o2 level sleeping without cpap o2 levels were dangerously low so i got another cpap and they came up to normal levels the watch clearly showed this the watch has so many more features that i may sometime use i recommend the series 7 watch,strap
364,works great and i love all the features battery life could be better i still have to charge every day and it is also heavier than i would prefer,battery
365,i got this as a gift from my wife for my birthday and i love it i had an apple watch series 2 that stopped working a bit over a year ago my wife got me this to replace it the jump from series 2 to 7 was dramatic i did research to find out exactly what was different and i was disappointed to find out that it still had an 18 hour battery life however through my experience it can last closer to 30 hours per charge but i do only use it as a watch and occasionally a timer so i imagine that having an influence on battery life it also was fully connected and updated within an hour and came with about 80 percent battery life the only downside is that it does not come with a charging brick however this is standard for apple as they stopped including bricks years ago you still get the cable though all in all i love it and i love the deep red color that this watch is,battery
366,battery does not last a full 24 hours so this interrupts my day,battery
367,the product came in immaculate condition and arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected on the watch itself it is very practical and helps me a lot to control health issues such as the daily rings where you set a goal of hours standing exercise and burning of calories and when you complete these 3 goals you get some prizes and that motivates me a lot it also comes with 3 free months of the fitness apple exercise app the apple watch 7 home screens in my opinion are wonderful also the battery doesn't last so long usually lasts 1 and a half day for me but the recharge is absurdly fast you can go from 5percent to 90percent in 30 minutes a negative side is that it comes without the charger source which is different from the normal source but it is not very difficult to find on the internet at Overall the product is worth it for the functionality and practicality in addition to the apple system integration that is simply wonderful,battery
368,gave my daughter for christmas battery life is great and the watch is very accurate my daughter loves it,battery
369,liked the display and health apps,screen
370,100percent original product recommended,screen
371,nice watch works great with my iphone 12 pro abyss blue is deep blue great new color much larger display then my apple watch 3 too many features to list watch face looks much better then the uploaded photos,screen
372,not the color i ordered there is no charging block with watch the end is different it does not take regular charging block still have not found right block with a end to charge watch so i can not set it up to even see if i like,others
373,love the color and it is user friendly but you must down load manuel for better understanding of its operations if your a first time user it explains the operation in detail being 70 appreciate the fall feature heart rate and oxygen saturation rate app also has a ekg app to verify if you are in atrial fabulation,screen
374,looking thru all the reviews and most of the negative ones are about battery life not satisfactory i have tested my apple watch series 7 with not having the always on display and found that if i turn that setting off i only burn 25 30percent battery in a full work day 10 hrs i do not know about you but if i am not looking at my watch why would i need the display on when you turn always on display feature off watch display comes on only when you look at it immediately and that is perfect for me just go to display and brightness on your phone in the apple watch app and turn off always on think about if your phone had a setting where it was always onit would be dead in no time and everyone would be complaining the battery does not last,battery
375,i have upgraded from watch 4 to 7 so for me i see lot of changes and i really like it some one upgrading it from 6 to 7 i do not think it would be a great upgrade,screen
376,the apple watch series 7 is very fast functional and beautiful the purchase came on time with all items as described in the ad,screen
377,the battery life needs to be upgraded it does not last as long as the series 3 other than that it is a great watch,battery
378,the watch is great but i remember when you did not have to change a battery for months this watch needs to be charged every day,battery
379,my apple watch does everything i want it to and more sleek and stylish with lots of helpful apps,screen
380,i love it i have owned several other brands and apple blows them out of the water i will never go back remember you get what you pay for,others
381,this is my first piece of wearable tech i chose the apple watch because i am an iphone user and have faith in apple products due to their simplicity aesthetics cutting edge technology durability product support and overall value so far this watch has lived up to all my expectations in terms of feature benefits my main interest are the heart health functions including the mindfulness breath app the fall detection also seems like good insurance it will automatically contact 911 in the event of a hard fall beyond that the watch itself is beautiful as a watch and very convenient from a communication perspective amazon is pricing and delivery were great i am very satisfied,others
382,the best smart watch that exists the frames I loved they noticed and in color I recommend it also the shipment was super fast,others
383,my first apple watchit is perfect color fits good and it monitors my health,screen
384,okay if you like strapping a phone on your wrist,strap
385,this is my first apple watch and just love it the pairing to my iphone only took a few minutes the robust battery last a full 18 hours if you do not have a cellular plan for your new watch it can only be connected to wi fi apple only ship the charging cable the charger brick is not included and must purchase separately,battery
386,fast processor bog screen beautiful watch,screen
387,beautiful watch super easy set up brand new wish i would have purchased it sooner,screen
388,watch is perfect fast stylish and long battery life however it does not give u a charging brick so i have no way to charge it,battery
389,still need to buy additional equipment to function,others
390,I loved everything the color of it in person and even more beautiful perfect the battery lasts well for an apple watch in the exercises it works well I loved it everything came well packaged and just right,battery
391,very nice looking watch easy to pair and love all the apps,screen
392,great watch does everything,screen
393,just great meets my expectations good battery life,battery
394,chargeer is not working,battery
395,the battery life is unacceptable for the price of this watch,battery
396,all the features from the apple watch 6 with a bigger display battery life could be better in general work flawless without any problems,battery
397,i was looking forward for arriving of the watch it was not a problem pairing it with my iphone12 i really like great additional features like ekg  but i there was a bit problem the batteries did not last it was losing charge like crazy i was charging it every 16 hours on average i bought for an upcoming trip so batteries life is very important i will buy this watch again when they address and improve their batteries ps it is a great looking watch with wonderful functions i wish i could have given it more than 3 stars,battery
398,in love with my apple watch first one i have ever owned so i am really happy that i got the latest model,screen
399,only last about 10 hrs 11hrs before wanting to be charged which is frustrating and makes me not wanting to wear it why would anyone want to keep charging a watch apple must step up their game watches should last a few days especially if ur trying to use it for safety while out and about makes their recent commercials seems like bs,battery
400,great watch but battery life could be better,battery
401,full battery used only max one day,battery
402,this product is top of the line what do you expect it is apple watch,screen
403,overall this watch does everything i expected and does it all very well the biggest downside is the battery life it is mediocre at best especially if you are coming from a more traditional fitness tracker style watch,battery
404,latest feature packed,screen
405,original apple product came all right nf sent by email and tmb along with the product arrived extremely fast and very well packed I am very happy with the purchase,strap
406,product was suppose to be new but came with a used watch which had an activation lock on it it took me 2 weeks with multiple emails to apple to convinced them i am the legal owner of the watch,others
407,great watch wonderful but apple battery lasts little but it is an excellent device I love it I recommend,battery
408,upgraded to the series 7 after my son broke my series 5 and man this is thing is a beauty this is my first time buying a stainless steel one and the gold really pops it really does look like a dime piece more elegant,others
409,what sense does it make to send the watch and the power cable but not the connector for the cable to the outlet it was necessary for me to order the connector at additional expense and delay in using the watch one would think you guys are smarter than that and then to further require another charging item for my already over run charging cable drawer,others
410,item is opened and watching is not working,screen
411,i bought this watch because i am 67 years old totally disabled in a power chair and i fall a lot i also have heart problems which is why i bought it for that also unfortunately the batteries not even lasting 11 hours and it goes totally dead i have tried everything it is fully updated i disconnected it reconnected it shut things down and what good is it if i can not run the things that i need i always liked apple products but this watch it definitely needs a stronger battery or something else it is just not worth the money i paid for it if i could i would return it,battery
412,gave this to my husband for xmas and he loves it helps monitor heart rate and very nice looking when he wears it,strap
413,i love my apple watch,screen
414,i really like the series 7 i had the 6 so not much difference in overall functionality however the screen is noticeably larger more smoothed out and rounded i was a bit disappointed in what they are calling green while it is not black it is not black like navy blue is not black and yet is called blue the green is there but it is not even as green as the phones are but i would buy again regardless as i do really enjoy the larger size,screen
415,upgraded my apple watch 4 44mm to this 7 45mm and i am so glad i did bigger screen more flexibility love it,screen
416,love the watch i have wanted one for a while my fitbit versa held a charge for 2 1 2 days this apple watch has to be charged every night,battery
417,I had the 1 gen that I bought right when it launched and I've been wanting to update it for a while not because I don't like it or anything like that but because I wanted some of the new features like ecg and blood oxygen measurement to do exercises and it's really good to sweat applications like strava and already load everything by itself the screen is another positive point even though it is smaller than my previous one it is bigger in its field of vision the only negative point I give is because of the compatibility of the bracelets that in this series are not compatible with the ones I had and so I'll have to buy new ones which is not very cheap apple blunder in my opinion,screen
418,this is my first iwatch and gifted to me for my birthday main complaint is that the battery last less than a day probably only 12 hours i do minimal usage of the watch and do not find it useful after all that i have gone back to wearing my citizen solar watch for accurate team keeping the regular citizen watch is always there for what i need most time keeping i use iwatch in power save mode to show only time very disappointed with the purchase,battery
419,just bought two watches as gifts and can not use them or set them up because the phones needed updates and we did that but now the watches are dead and there is only a usb c cord but no block am i the only one who thinks it is insane to include a cord but no blocks well i guess i will just have to wait for the holidays to be over to have a chance to go buy a charging block and make my gifts useable again thanks apple,others
420,was excited to get my watch only to find out there is not a charging block to charge the watch so what good does it do if you can not charge it do not even know what to do now all this money spent ugh very disappointing,others
421,aside from monitoring heart rate which can be done much more simply and cheaply with other products this thing is utterly redundant every one of its functions is performed better by the phone you have in your pocket,others
422,best version of apple watch so far,screen
423,great as every apple product,others
424,have not even had it is month and the battery is already going extremely quick i thought it was going rather quick from the beginning and i guess i was right because now it will not even last a day it is also starting to freeze up on certain screens and if it is already starting to do that there is more and worse to come i will be retuning it,battery
425,i cannot give this a high enough rating it is fantastic the only down side is the 18 hour battery life between charging,battery
426,wear for my heart blood oxygen,strap
427,i think the watch is a little cumbersome but i purchased it for some safety features and i feel very confident of its use in this way good way to communicate with my contacts quickly and easily overall delighted with this product,others
428,show apple products are indisputable,screen
429,i like how big the screen is compared to my previous apple watch series 4 excellent battery life even with the always on display,screen
430,it was asking for the watch to be updated and would not pair with the phone,screen
431,i use this mainly to track my health walking sitting standing blood pressure and heart health it is perfect it helps to have an iphone in my opinion the set up is seamless this is not inexpensive by any any means but so worth the money,screen
432,received a defective watch whose display will not turn on even after 2hrs of charging it first amazon delivers it late second it does not turn on third the amazon app does not have a replacement option only return how will i get this watch back on thanksgiving deal that i purchased it on very bad experience with amazon,screen
433,had a series 4 for3 years supposedly charger magnet became dislodged by a possible power surge and unfixable battery on new phone lasts long and like the new features but should have a trade in at the least,battery
434,good watch working like it is suppose too i can not complain,screen
435,i upgraded from a series 3 and i love the watch wish the battery lasted a little longer but i love it,battery
436,great product need more battery life span,battery
437,the battery life i have to change it every night not very happy with this purchase,battery
438,they have two sizes for the bands inside the box medium large and small i liked this concept better because i could never find a band that would fit my wrist the screen is bigger than the previous generation and the keyboard is a nice touch when texting,screen
439,love the health app was easy to set up but a month in my battery just does not last a full day what is up with that,battery
440,good battery and it was just what I wanted for a long time,battery
441,watch is fine overall does all as expected the band however broke the second time i took it off see picture highly recommend buying at least 1 2 more bands when you purchase the watch to avoid the down time the cheaper bands appear to be higher quality than the one it comes with,strap
442,love my apple watch the apps great price too,screen
443,i returned with item because it was a duplicate send to me,screen
444,the sleep tracking is nice but not as detailed as i would like it the mobile app is very informative i love closing my rings the battery life lasts for about a day i changed my settings and turned off the always on because it was burning the battery really fast,battery
445,very good product good materials and finishes the stainless steel watch looks very elegant somewhat expensive but the sapphire screen is well worth it,screen
446,not to happy with the watch band that comes with it love the fact that i can keep in touch with my family and friends,strap
447,be aware that this watch comes with the charging chord but not the much needed charging block and it does not fit any normal iphone chargers very frustrating,others
448,apple watch would not work correctly since i have tattoos i like to watch it like the features i bought it mostly for the fitness tracking ability but since my tattoos are full sleeves on both arms it will not work correctly i could buy a an anklet but then you have to change the wrist band daily to much work,strap
449,display broken christmas day not even 24 hrs out of box,screen
450,great watch lasts long battery wise definitely helps to keep me on track bought the band separate,battery
451,first time i have purchased the apple watch and it indeed came in its original case shipped and sold from amazon exceeded expectation,screen
452,must beautiful watch apple ever made  wide screen less bezels and good battery can last for a complete day  valuable for money and surely it is the best smart watch in the market,screen
453,updated from a 2 to the 7 could not be happier,screen
454,enjoying my christmas gift great watch,screen
455,love it but i knew that i would there are a ton of great features to the watch the short band fit my wrist better and the additional accessories i bought fit nicely only downside was the late delivery,others
456,I used apple watch series 2 for almost 5 years I switched to 7 because I wanted to use the ecg and o2 meter the only unmet expectation was the battery which I thought could last a little longer but the display and touch accuracy on the digital crown screen are fine much more improved in series 7,battery
457,i went from a very old apple watch to this one so there was like fireworks and stuff going off in my head it is a great watch for the price all new fabulous features much longer battery life and it even does an ekg  no heart problems here according to my watch thank goodness,battery
458,have avoided the apple watch because of inaccurate heart rate readings from the wrist when exercising but the series 7 pairs with the polar h10 chest strap for very accurate readings connects through settings blue tooth health devices have not had any problems am very happy with this combination,strap
459,i was suspecious becuase this came in a amazon box then when i opened the box it came in the apple watch box but without the clear plastic packing over it but it did have the green pull tabs on it and it as not tampered with this is the real thing i love it so much,strap
460,i like the fact i can look at the face and see the time without having to touch it,screen
461,i am 73 years old the week after i purchased this watch i fell this watch immediately alerted to ask if i needed emergency help the emergency button was on screen available for me to press if i was injured or could not get up it requested confirmation that i did not need help i wish i had it earlier this year when i had broken my foot from a fall rather than hobbling to a phone i could have just pressed the emergency button thank you apple watch,screen
462,just got watch the other day have been reading up on them for several months and decided to finally purchase one really like the health features i was going in for some test and told my doctor about the new watch and he said it would help with us staying in contact with vitals that he wants to track cool,others
463,the battery should last longer,battery
464,paired to my iphone 7s plus effortlessly i get a little over a day on a charge with a good amount of use magnetic snap on charger so easy to use 45mm screen big enough to see and use touch entry comfy band quite user friendly after watching a video had it since christmas day and still love it,screen
465,battery life could be better,battery
466,husband wanted to track health and other mobile items this watch is fantastic for this it also looks cool and keeps great time,others
467,the best thing about this is the ecg oxygen saturation which is temperamental and only works some of the time fyi it is a lot of money for the convenience of having your phone on your wrist which is pretty much what it is friends have the cellular version mine is only gps and they think it is life changing i can still talk on mine as long as my phone is around across the room upstairs it still works i have not been able to figure out the sleep tracking upgraded from fitbit and gotta say their sleep tracking is superior in ease of use and results only cost dollar69 that also had heart rate tracking if you work where you can not use a phone i can see the work around of still having your phone but not it is a lot of money to skirt around the no phone rule maybe i am just old school am used to not looking at my phone every second of every day my review is meh i will not return it but i can see living with out it maybe that will change with time,strap
468,this apple watch is perfect it let is me know if my blood pressure is off and i can check my pulse ox especially with being in covid times,screen
469,this new iwatch 7 is great bpm gauge connectivity look make it outstanding i liked it,others
