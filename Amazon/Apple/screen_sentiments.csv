41,i just upgraded from a s3 and to be honest i have a hard time finding the improvements the screen because of the rolled edges and the way text kind of rolls off the side looks strange and gives the impression your using a 3rd party app that was not designed for your system but you are not it is apple the ecg system is honestly the only reason i bought the watch and love that feature if you do not need the ecg stay with the se or s6 as that one does not utilize the rolled edges,screen,positive

62,this is my first apple watch i bought it from apple and i love it still learning all it has to offer i am disappointed however in the display this series is touted to be more rugged than previous series i am not that rough and after less than 2 months i already have 2 large scratches see picture at first i had a plastic film on it but once i got active moisture accumulated underneath there are were no covers available plus i did not want to add bulk to the already large display of course the warranty does not cover this eventually i will use my applecare to replace it,screen,positive

68,"the apple watch works very well, fluid navigation and several applications to access the seller is mega attentive and responds quickly",screen,positive
69,i upgraded from a series 4 apple watch i like the always on display and the added blood oxygen measurement other than that it does not do much of anything that the older watch does not do but imo it is enough to justify the upgrade fwiw the slightly larger display is not at all obvious is it a little bigger yes but if i was not told beforehand i would never have noticed,screen,positive
70,this apple watch does not support kt cellular in the region apple watch can only be used with cellular plans that are certified by your carrier i live in south korea and as soon as i turn on this watch this is what i get what a disappointment,screen,negative

73,the watch is great the battery should last a little longer the screen is very beautiful and the finish is impeccable I recommend it,screen,positive
74,not brand new it is not an unopened box plastic wrapping is missing and microfractures on the screen the first package picture was not apple freshly wrapped the box was opened the plastic was ripped off of it and there are microfractures on the screen now the replacement package video has arrived and is also not apple freshly wrapped the plastic seal is nonexistent and the box is opened on one side now i am expected to go without the watch i paid for by returning my first one along with the replacement one then wait for a refund then purchase another one then pray that it is actually new still wrapped in apple is plastic seal then wait for that to arrive still all that equates to massive inconvenience multiplied by the loss of my prime time divided by every dime of mine stuck in limbo simplifies to being filled with hope that just maybe this time i will receive a brand new apple watch as advertised guess i will give the dice another roll maybe third times the charm so fingers crossed folks,screen,negative
75,truly overhyped and started having issues with it not even 3 days into having it spotify stopped syncing and many of the features were not working tried to use it to track my boxing workout and it kept ending work out on its own so it did not measure anything save your money go with fitbit or something cheaper because this is not worth it,screen,negative

87,the apple watch 7 is nice especially if you are upgrading from a version that is several years old but beware it only comes with a charger that is usb c so if you do not already have a usb power brick or old watch charger you have to buy that and will not be able to charge your watch,screen,positive

96,love this thing had been wanting an apple watch for a while and finally made the purchase arrived super quick,screen,positive
97,i considered buying a used apple watch a couple years ago because the current watch at the time did not seem to do much more than the older watches then the 7 was going to come out with always on feature and larger screen which for me was the thing i wanted i am so far loving it the ability to switch between always on faces means it can go from looking like an elegent watch plain artistic face to utilitarian with a swipe the added health features are a bonus although i do not really need them i could see those features being very handy for an older user that is trying to monitor changes to heart rate o2 saturation etc,screen,positive
98,apple watch series 7 is a great purchase easy to use and sync and has a wide variety of features,screen,positive

104,the brightness of the screen is the same as series 5 or at least to my eyes the more disappointing feature is the milanese band quality is not same as the series 5 one i have the series 7 band kinks quite often my series 5 band is constructed much better with a smooth jewel like feel,screen,positive
105,beautiful watch,screen,positive
106,i was debating between and 41 and 44mm watch i am very happy with the 41mm the notifications and awards for moving is incredibly motivating i love that you get to connect and compete with friends keeps you super accountable to get your daily movement and steps in highly recommend for anyone thinking about getting one of these gadgets really fun to play with,screen,positive

118,i had an older one almost 5 years old and so i knew i would love it with this one i got a bigger screen totally worth it everything about the new one is great if you are thinking about one trust me it is worth it i use it for the workout features and keeping me from sitting too much also to set timers and reminders leave your phone in the other room no problem text from your watch talk on the phone too it is like an 70s kid is now in the jetson is,screen,positive

127,the ios is horrible frustrating and counter intuitive want a stopwatch not on this device oh it has a stopwatch that is useless garbage after one minute the only thing it displays is 1 what genius thought of this it is not saving battery the display is still on you can raise your wrist and the numbers appear but if i have a heavy dumbbell in my hand or i am stabilizing it in my lap i can not move my wrist just have the flipping numbers on screen ffs do you want to know what minute you are on after 70 seconds tough sh the screen switches to the time so now you are forced to bring up your wrist and yes i have looked up and changed every setting possible nothing i do prevents this well why do not you download a third part app hey let is try that that was a massive headache itself and after i finally did download a third party stopwatch app that showed all of the numbers the amazing intuitive apple ios darkens and reverts to the time un flipping believable want to turn that setting off tough sh mr customer you can only look at the app for 70 seconds so screw your three minute timer peasant what you need to do is toggle the hide sensitive complications options on or off guess what that does not work not after 70 seconds while i am talking about the display sometimes an app view screen shows up randomly and i literally can not do anything to get out of it the only option i have is to turn it off and back on again that is extremely frustrating also they need to figure out which direction the scroll when is used for one screen the scroll wheel moves the screen in the direction you push the wheel up is up and down is down but when you go to move the cursor to edit text down on the wheel moves the cursor up why why would they do this well we are on the subject of text the talk to text on this watch is atrocious i can say the exact same thing on my iphone and it works great the watch simply does a turd job at understanding talk to text when i do scroll down to go up and select a word to change it to something that i actually said instead of what it wrote the options simply are not there ever also when i am on the workout app tracking my heart rate and i switch to a stopwatch app to track my time in between sets i looked down at my watch to check the time and it switched back to the workout app that is so extremely frustrating when i switch to another app i want to look at that flipping app i do not want you to change to the time i do not want you to change apps regardless of what you think i want to see it is little stuff like this that makes me want to ask will it blend sometimes i think putting it down the garbage disposal or in a vitamix would make me much happier due to the frustration i have with the ios what stops me from doing that the hardware the hardware is really amazing i love the way it feels in my wrist i love the heart rate monitor which never drops my heart rate unlike every fitbit or mio watch i have had the screen is fantastic the haptics are really nice and not overbearing for the amount that this thing cost the fact that the software is so crippling there is no way i can recommend someone purchase this until they get the ios fixed,screen,positive
128,I've been an apple watch user for a long time and I've never had any complaints about making an excellent product,screen,positive
129,best apple watch ever love it,screen,positive
130,got this to check my o2 levels and my afib and so my son knows when i fall since my balance is like a one year old is like that it connects with my phone and i can bluetooth music without exposing the phone to my cleaning or planting do not like that the apps are geared towards young athletic types we need the activity meter to have a rehab calibration and one for senior seniors over 70 completely different needs and abilities the huge boomer population is getting on and the medical aspects of this watch are helpful but there needs to be a bit more development geared towards differently abled half the icons are so small i can not tell what they are the list layout is heaven sent wish i could design my own icons because even the ones i can see are not intuitive i like the starlight color and the bigger size the warm brushed beige is flattering to aging complexions need a couple pastels or soft hues to balance the harsh dark primary colors cornflower cocoa turquoise and such still learning how to navigate the watch with my big arthritic fingers apple should design a fingertip stylus that attaches securely to the band waiting to be slipped on,screen,positive
131,absolutely love this watch,screen,positive

155,i really like the series 7 i had the 6 so not much difference in overall functionality however the screen is noticeably larger more smoothed out and rounded i was a bit disappointed in what they are calling green while it is not black it is not black like navy blue is not black and yet is called blue the green is there but it is not even as green as the phones are but i would buy again regardless as i do really enjoy the larger size,screen,positive
156,upgraded my apple watch 4 44mm to this 7 45mm and i am so glad i did bigger screen more flexibility love it,screen,positive
157,I had the 1 gen that I bought right when it launched and I've been wanting to update it for a while not because I don't like it or anything like that but because I wanted some of the new features like ecg and blood oxygen measurement to do exercises and it's really good to sweat applications like strava and already load everything by itself the screen is another positive point even though it is smaller than my previous one it is bigger in its field of vision the only negative point I give is because of the compatibility of the bracelets that in this series are not compatible with the ones I had and so I'll have to buy new ones which is not very cheap apple blunder in my opinion,screen,positive
