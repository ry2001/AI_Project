1,i have owned an apple watch since the 2 i had the 4 and loved it the 7 is equally as great and is faster bigger with always on and blood oxygen detection the stainless steel feels more substantial and looks better but the aluminum is great too i have not owned a titanium or ceramic version all my bands work with this bigger size,strap,positive
2,i was notified that apple watch package had arrived a short while ago after opening package i realized the watch itself was not in package only the watch band and cord were in box,strap,negative
3,i have a small wrist so the adjustable band on this apple watch is perfect for me,strap,positive
4,love the gold finish it is not too overwhelming the size is amazing loop is durable and high quality worth it,strap,positive
5,very functional for those who use the apple ecosystem I need heart rate measurements etc. many options for apps and bracelets I find it interesting for those who want to use it in physical activities who only look for cell phone notifications I think the cost x benefit is low for these cases a smartband of 200 reais watch out good,strap,positive
6,my husband went to open up his birthday gift of this apple watch and there was the charger the band but there was no apple watch in the box this is the second time i have ordered an apple watch off amazon and received no apple watch,strap,negative

8,watch is very versatile and looks great easy to use and an abundance of info be careful our first box was missing the actual watch and one band seems like the seals were broken amazon replaced immediately,strap,positive
9,i am upgrading from a series 1 so it is a completely different watch i am very satisfied with this purchase most of the heart monitoring functions only work with people older than 22 which is frustrating for me especially since i paid for the watch so i should get access to all the features nonetheless i really like the starlight apple watch and band it is very subtle and nice to look at hopefully braided solo loops get a sale soon bc i really would like one it is a pain that they do not give power bricks but this is the new age i highly suggest you purchase many usb c power bricks and switch all cords from usb a to usb c anker has great ones and you can always find deals for them,strap,positive

12,this was a great christmas present my significan not other really enjoys to wear the watch the original band that comes with it is also small enough for people with very slim spindly antenna like wrists to wear comfortably it has many nice features including weirdly enough a strange ability to read how much oxygen is in your blood that has something to do with lights and colors and sounds and the feeling of being on a giant rock that is moving through space at incredible speeds you are alive look up look up i see you now you look nice take care of yourself enjoy this product by apple goodbye,strap,positive
13,this is my second apple watch my first one was great so i decided to purchase a second one within a month of having the watch the wrist strap broke i reached out to apple and it seemed like i was going to get a new band free of charge that was not the case they billed me and have not reimbursed me i have had multiple conversations with apple without resolution i have been waiting since 2 22 for a reimbursement very disappointed with the service especially with crystal the supervisor i spoke with,strap,positive

24,i was super excited to receive the newer version of the apple watch as it was a huge upgrade from my apple 3 when i got it the thin card board box not the shipping box it came in was torn in a couple spots and it was also missing the band it was supposed to come with so i returned super disappointed,strap,positive
25,the band is not starlight like the picture shows it is an ugly beige no power adapter for the magnetic charger so i can not even charge it should come with the adapter,strap,negative
26,i was disappointed in the color of the band i thought it looked like pearly white,strap,negative
27,first of all it took forever to set up then i was trying to set up the heart monitor an hour later found out u have to be 22 to use it the band on this watch is useless slips easy this thing is going back and i will stick with my series 5 then i am going to by an android phone so i can be free of apple,strap,positive

34,the main thing is band needs to be much smaller even the smallest size is too big,strap,negative
35,the watch is great the band keeps opening not a very good latch system for this price watch,strap,positive
36,i would have chosen another color but this was available the sports band feels like skin and is extremely comfortable i got the watch to track my health readings during sleep my cpap was under fda recall not to use so i was monitoring my o2 level sleeping without cpap o2 levels were dangerously low so i got another cpap and they came up to normal levels the watch clearly showed this the watch has so many more features that i may sometime use i recommend the series 7 watch,strap,positive

40,wear for my heart blood oxygen,strap,negative
41,watch is fine overall does all as expected the band however broke the second time i took it off see picture highly recommend buying at least 1 2 more bands when you purchase the watch to avoid the down time the cheaper bands appear to be higher quality than the one it comes with,strap,negative
42,not to happy with the watch band that comes with it love the fact that i can keep in touch with my family and friends,strap,positive
43,apple watch would not work correctly since i have tattoos i like to watch it like the features i bought it mostly for the fitness tracking ability but since my tattoos are full sleeves on both arms it will not work correctly i could buy a an anklet but then you have to change the wrist band daily to much work,strap,positive
44,have avoided the apple watch because of inaccurate heart rate readings from the wrist when exercising but the series 7 pairs with the polar h10 chest strap for very accurate readings connects through settings blue tooth health devices have not had any problems am very happy with this combination,strap,positive
45,i was suspecious becuase this came in a amazon box then when i opened the box it came in the apple watch box but without the clear plastic packing over it but it did have the green pull tabs on it and it as not tampered with this is the real thing i love it so much,strap,positive
46,the best thing about this is the ecg oxygen saturation which is temperamental and only works some of the time fyi it is a lot of money for the convenience of having your phone on your wrist which is pretty much what it is friends have the cellular version mine is only gps and they think it is life changing i can still talk on mine as long as my phone is around across the room upstairs it still works i have not been able to figure out the sleep tracking upgraded from fitbit and gotta say their sleep tracking is superior in ease of use and results only cost dollar69 that also had heart rate tracking if you work where you can not use a phone i can see the work around of still having your phone but not it is a lot of money to skirt around the no phone rule maybe i am just old school am used to not looking at my phone every second of every day my review is meh i will not return it but i can see living with out it maybe that will change with time,strap,positive
