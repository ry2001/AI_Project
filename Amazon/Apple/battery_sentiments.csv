0,battery life is very bad not recommended for extended periods of time doing exercise i do mtb and after 2 hours battery drains and you loose all remaining data the info on the apple workout not very detailed the glass not very resistant to scratches,battery,negative
1,not enough battery time love the availability of answering the phone text messages a lot to read about to use properly,battery,positive
2,wowabsolutely this is amazingyou have worry about price or battery are you a apple fanboy or fangirl  it does not matter it covered all of them buy right now specially it was amazing when i work out outside and i felt apple watch check my health all day if you have concern about thing in this pandemic i recommend buy this also it is better than se,battery,positive
3,I love reliable seller arrived with original sealed box as previous comments within the delivery period the only negative point is that I found that the battery lasts a maximum of 2 days at least for me my remaining use everything is great,battery,positive
4,great battery life 24 hours i use it to track my runs cycling weight lifting walks much more also not too big just right,battery,positive
5,not even close to performance of a fitbit battery does not last a full day even with always on turned off mine may be defective sleep tracking gives a total but no detail mode has to be manually changed for an outdoor walk apps on the whole work really well with the iphone but in my case the fitbit does just as well for a lot less money and it holds a charge for 4 5 days,battery,positive
6,i absolutely love my new apple watch i upgraded to the 7 because i had a 2 and my battery was not holding a charge all day the 7 is amazing and was the best price i could find in this model,battery,positive
7,excellent all features and upgrades are worth the price battery takes at least 24 hours to be charged again,battery,positive
8,i liked the watch however amazon dropped the price dollar42 less than 5 days after i got it from them amazon refused to refund the price difference so i returned it battery life was awful even when i removed numerous apps from it and turned off numerous notifications the watch itself i also decided i did not need that big of an electronic nanny measuring how long i washed my hands when i needed to take deep breaths etc so i decided to not buy it at all simply not for me,battery,negative
9,the watch is nice the battery life does not last more than a day specially if you use the workout activity app,battery,positive
10,i was worried the watch was not going to work based on some of these reviews but it came in perfect condition it did take a while to charge up but then it was good to go buy it the battery has lasted me all day,battery,positive
11,the apples watch has a great set of features integration with apps and level of control on notifications which is something i noticed missing on other watches i had tried ability to unlock your iphone which is great if you are wearing a mask these days also the apple pay is nice bonus best smartwatch i have tried to date biggest draw backs short battery life plan to charge it daily and no temperature sensor,battery,positive
12,Excellent product as apple standard however I expected more from the battery,battery,positive
13,i dislike the battery life if you havevto charge it every night so if you have to charge it every night then what good is the sleep function charging cord does not have the usb connection so you also have to go and buy another cord or abother plug to use it,battery,positive
14,it took me a while to decide to upgrade my apple watch hard to justify a smart watch over dollar300 in my opinion however my series 3 was so slow took forever to install an update no space for apps data storage etc i got a fitbit charge 5 as a temporary place holder tried to convince myself i liked it more than an apple watch ultimately i came back to apple i opted for the 41mm series 7 because i did not need an extra 4mm for another dollar100 it moves so seamlessly fast to charge lightyears ahead of the series 3 lots of new watch face templates to choose from beautiful edge to edge display of course you can choose to have always on display but that will quickly deplete your battery life ultimately just get the upgrade that is within your budget and you will not regret it,battery,positive
15,the watch is perfect as always the apple battery leaves something to be desired the rest super met my expectations,battery,positive
16,great product am very happy with purchase took me awhile to figure out getting notifications to work do not know if i messed up the settings so i reset watch and now works great only thing i do not like is needing to charge daily i had a cheap smart watch and it would take 2 3 weeks until it needed to be charged although the cheap smart watch could not be used to answer phone or reply to messages all in all i am very happy with product,battery,positive
17,great watch with many features same crappy battery life my fitbit lasts 10 14 days between recharges,battery,positive
18,love it of course battery life is not compared to fitbit luxe you have to compare apples to apples fitbit is a tracker iwatch is a tiny ipad no comparison the sleep tech could really use some tech update but the added fall program with all the balance monitoring the heart health monitoring hearing monitoring plus so much more is above and beyond anything i have tried fitbit sense not even close in performance but very close in dollardollardollardollar,battery,positive
19,i bought this for husband and i have series 3 with me when we compare both you have to charging for series is 3 just for 15 mins but to series 7 it takes like 22 mins and still need to keep one more time in a day so a part form battery every this is good quality and all,battery,positive
20,the watch is simply amazing it has ticked all the boxes a smart watch should have amazing battery life and accuracy in health reading is awesome cheers,battery,positive
21,i have a series 4 and have never felt the need to upgrade as my battery life still lasts me nearly two days it has not been slowed down by any software updates and still works fine i finally decided to upgrade to the series 7 for the larger always on screen and blood oxygen sensor it is definitely not worth it i do not know if it is due to the always on screen or what but the battery life of this new series 7 is far worse than on my 3 year old series 4 watch when i take the watch off it only has 35percent battery left at the end of the day and that is with barely any use whereas my series 4 can still end the day with over 50percent battery left i imagine if i had any workouts or used many apps on the watch during the couple of weeks of owning the watch it would have died before the end of the day also the blood oxygen only seems to work about half the time and the readings are all over the place again i upgraded to have the always on display but that is pointless if i have to disable it to get decent battery life,battery,negative
22,not a good battery at all will not get another one,battery,negative
23,my watch ran out of power in less than 2 days,battery,negative
24,great watch and great features but the battery does not last long it has to be charged every night,battery,positive
25,cons so if you are switching from a fitbit for your first apple watch like myself you will miss your fitbit it does not track your calories all day like your fitbit because it does not automatically detect your work out calorie burn it does not track your sleep details the same either i almost want to buy a fitbit that is just weird though wearing 2watcheslast bad thing is the battery you have to charge it every day ohand mine was not charging i had to go to best buy and get another charger cable i got the one with usb port then it started chargingscrew that other one it does not work pros it is fun technology i like how my ring notifications come out on my watch and it shows the video i like how i am washing my hands and it times it it is good to check your blood oxygen and heart ratebut that is it pretty much i can still control my my music like on my fit bit i do not really text people from my watch i guess that is the other benefit but other than that nothing really amazing about it i did not get cellular you do not need it if you always have your phone near by it connected to my phone quick i miss my fitbit though the only sad part,battery,positive
26,battery life lasts less than 1 day without using many functions ons,battery,negative
27,first i love the color i had another brand fitness watch that i really liked but this one is awesome and i love it it has all the amenities and syncs to my iphone perfectly there is only one thing i think needs improvement the battery life i have found myself recharging the watch more often than desired,battery,positive
28,it is extremely irritating that apple will send you a dollar400 watch with absolutely no way to charge it it is so exhausting how they keep changing things like this to force you to buy new accessories they did not bother to include the required usb c power adapter with the watch something that almost no one actually has so you need to shell out another dollar20 and hope your watch with horrendous battery life does not die before you can get one either give us a power cord you can plug into a standard usb driver or give us an adapter with a usb c plug this is really ridiculous,battery,negative
29,its like having most of the features of an iphone on your wrist so it is convenient you can receive calls answer texts too hate the battery if turn you on always on it lasts barely a day i can stretch it out to 2 days with only the necessary features apps still worth it once you get used to the daily charging,battery,negative
30,i love this watch when i am working out i can track my heart rate blood oxygen ecg time spend on each exercise etc i am getting more use out of it in my day to day than i ever thought i would the only real downside is the battery life when using all the features you need to charge it once a day minimally and it takes an hour and a half or so to charge which is not horrible but i wish i had a little more time between charges i am giving it 5 stars anyway because it is so useful in every other way,battery,positive
31,i thought watches were outdated until i bought a fit bit for fitness tracking in less than a year my desire grew for more fitness data and i added swimming to my routine i bought an apple watch series 3 exactly 3 years ago loved it passed it onto my daughter and upgraded to the 7 series i absolutely love these watches the 7 is easier to use if that is even possible and the battery life is much much better than my 3 if you are a first time buyer or looking to upgrade i highly suggest this one,battery,positive
32,the watch battery dies in 10 minutes i had apple watch before and this is not the norm i left it charging overnight and still low battery even when i got a new charger,battery,negative
33,love the watch battery dies fast so i have to charge it and then i forget to put it back on,battery,positive
34,the battery of my apple watch drains very fast did adjustment did not help may be watch is deflective thinking to return back to amazon,battery,negative
35,love the color choices battery lasts a lot longer have not used the sleep tracking feature but really like the blood monitoring feature,battery,positive
36,only the battery could last longer,battery,negative
37,battery could have been better,battery,positive
38,after years of using pebble and amazfit watches i decided to go apple watch because of the heart monitoring features and solid support for my ios devices phone tablet the watch works great getting it setup with my iphone 12 pro was just a non event it worked instantly the display is amazing just gorgeous the reaction time with using the screen crown or button is instant no lag at all the only issue i have is the battery i never went to apple watch before series 7 because 24 or less hours of battery life and having to carry a custom charging base everywhere i got is just untenable series 7 docs state even with always on display the average is a goal of 18 hours ha i am lucky to get 10 or 12 and it does not even do much during the day i have tested others like several android watches over the years too and none were this consumptive of battery the sleep tracking works fine but it is not comfortable to wear in bed all night i do not think any band is overall i like it i will use it it works super well with my iphone and the apps are great but honestly if i had known the battery life was this short with average usage i would have probably gone with another amazfit or the pebble based fitbit versa 3,battery,positive
39,great product and great battery life even though it stays on all the time wish mine did,battery,positive
40,i received this watch yesterday today i needed to re charge the battery guess what the charging cable does not fit into any of my apple charging adapters i called amazon and was told that the adapter does not come with the apple watch the charging adapter must be bought separately are you kidding me what a rip off,battery,negative
41,i unfortunately am allergic to something in the watch i unfortunately had to stop wearing it after only three days due to an allergic reaction probably due to the nickel in the watch as for the battery for a watch that cost as much as it does it should last more than a day to a day and a half,battery,negative
42,wonderful item battery very perfect drops after 24 hrs,battery,positive
43,i like the size and it has help up pretty decent the battery life is not as good as competing products i,battery,positive
44,lots more info and options than the under dollar100 fitness watches really enjoying fitness workout options doubt i will ever go back to a lesser model battery life is not what i had hoped expected requires a daily charge fortunately it is a rapid recharge as far as accuracy often does not recognize that i am standing and have been for several hours simply because my arms are not moving enough while working at my standing desk it does provide notice though so i can flap my arms and achieve my rings good motivation overall it is a lot of money compared to other fitness watches but it is worth it,battery,positive
45,it is a great watch i used fitbit samsung and some cheaper watches but all were a waste compared to this watch love how it integrates with my phone and reminds me to get off my butt all day long as a heart patient it monitors many things i need to keep an eye on like heart rate blood oxygen lever and so much more through the health app glad i finally bit the bullet and made this purchase a little disappointed in battery life compared to other products can not use the sleep monitoring benefits as i have to charge it every night love having mickey mouse on it so i can just tell people i got a mickey mouse watch,battery,positive
46,battery does not last,battery,negative
47,the watch pleasantly surprised me the battery lasts all day and charges super fast really good,battery,positive
48,i had the apple watch series 6 and hated how short the battery would work this one is battery lasts way longer a lot quicker to charge item was as described amazing resolution i love everything about this watch honestly super simple to install and start using i believe it took me 30 mins tops i love how it is way more accurate on my sleep heart rate and all my movements and stats my issue with series 6 is it was not accurate as well and would not track my sleep no matter how much troubleshooting i did this one i have my sleep tracked on here and way better application overall i highly recommend this watch for people wanting something to have that does so much more than other watches and has a iphone so they are connected all day long i am so happy to get this for christmas and will never look back,battery,positive
49,with all the iphone functions turned off this watch loses 20percent of its charge each day just sitting and doing nothing itself,battery,negative
50,i previously had a fitbit and loved it decided to upgrade to an apple watch was very upset to open the box and not find a charging cube since the charger has a type c end on it you need a special plug cube i did not have any so was not able to use my watch until i purchased an adapter or charging station for the cost of the series 7 apple should include the cubes or at least an adapter battery life is terrible only 18 24 hrs hard to track sleeping when you have to charge so often,battery,positive
51,worst in it is battery length i think amazfit and fitbit are far far better than this,battery,negative
52,only pain i had was the initial setup apple watch is simply superb strong battery life easy to use,battery,positive
53,the battery should have been more durable,battery,negative
54,the battery wears out too soon,battery,negative
55,the sleep tracking do not satisfied me at all and so do the battery life i have a mi band 6 and while it loses 7percent the apple watch loses 43percent i am not kidding this is insane,battery,negative
56,"The product complies with the characteristics, the colors and brightness are great, the battery continues to be a must for Apple compared to other competitors, it lasts approx. 48 hours with its charge and regarding monitoring, it complies with the basics.",battery,positive
57,i absolutely love my watch only bad is battery do not last but one day,battery,positive
58,ordering and receiving went fine i am disappointed with the watch though i just switched from fitbit to the apple watch 7 and had an expectation that i would be able to configure my watch face how i wanted i want to have my step count on the face and i want to see my current heart rate not what it was 7 minutes ago those two things make me think my purchase was wrong and i should have stayed with fitbit my two other major disappointments are with the battery life my fitbit had a 5 7 day battery life and not coming with the brick i had already upgraded my phone so i knew there would not be a charging brick and cable but still very disappointed i have only had my watch for 3 days but am not sure if i made the right decision or if i will go back to fitbit so disappointed,battery,negative
59,battery life is great i have a pretty active day 8 5 10 hours and use it for music i charge it maybe once in the afternoon and do not have to charge it again until midday the next day,battery,positive
60,it is a very nice looking watch that is so easy to use going for a walk run or bike ride it is easy to start recording the event battery life is about the biggest downfall it definitely has to be charged every day,battery,positive
61,really easy to set up only issue i have is the battery drains fairly fast i love it so far,battery,positive
62,the battery only lasts 1 day,battery,negative
63,there are several glitches in the watch first i do not know why you would monitor you sleep unless you want to take the watch off in the morning to charge it batter life is only a 30hours so it does half way through the day the heath monitoring is constantly glitches it does not count your workouts towards your daily goal unless you recalibrate regularly you only get to monitor you cardiac fitness once even with recalibration to get rid of the unnecessary apple apps on the watch you have to delete them off the iphone recommend waiting for another generation or two,battery,positive
64,i love the watch every thing works on it like it should the only complaint i have is the battery life but it is a fairly quick charge,battery,positive
65,this is my second apple watch and this is 2 5 months old and three times it has gotten warm and then will not hold a charge for more than a couple of hours i am completely frustrated as it feels like i have no recourse,battery,negative
66,the watch is sleek beautiful very responsive and works wonders when filled with juice but that is the thing battery barely lasts 24 hours ex i charged yesterday at 7 pm did not use for anything else but to watch the time my sleep track if actually off so it is not like the watch is working extra during the night rn is noon and i have 46percent battery and still have 7 hours to go for the full 24 hrs so yeah very disappointed with the battery life my coworker have a series 5 and he told me it lasts 2 days no problem so i am really bummed on this regard,battery,negative
67,i like everything about this watch accept the battery life is poor,battery,positive
68,there is no secret as new smartwatches keep joining the battle it is still apple who keeps winning the race workout tracking steps heart rate ecg blood oxigen unlocking your iphone and mac without face id or passcode apple pay notifications for all apps on your wrist etc it is a very cool gadget to have very useful and very functional to me the only down side is still the battery there are other smartwatches that beat the apple watch big time on battery so it makes you wonder what does apple need to create a watch with a battery that lasts as least a couple of days aside from the battery which to me only represents the hastle of putting the watch on the charger for about an hour the charging is super fast now there is nothing else to complain about i picked the aluminum red one with the standard silicone band and i absolutely love it,battery,positive
69,i love this new apple watch it loses battery super quick though even when i turned off the always on screen at the end of the day it usually ends up on 30percent which isnt that bad but idk,battery,positive
70,wow that was fast 24 hours after purchase had apple watch series 7 on my wrist upon unboxing the watch face displayed low battery i put it on the charger and it was 3 4 charged in less than 15 minutesi had to download and install the latest updates this process took a little longer than i had expected after watching other reviews that questioned the authenticity of their purchase product of course i was a little nervous going into such a large purchase however this is absolutely apple you can feel it and see it in the packaging before you even get to the good stuff i think that it is important to mention that i did purchase the apple care package for dollar79 perhaps that ensures the authenticity of what you were purchasing just a thought i can not wait to start closing those exercise rings and earning those spinning medallions happy apple girl correction in the last clip of the video i said 40 mm obviously it is 45 mm,battery,positive
71,i have been wanting an apple watch and finally purchased one i was a little leary with the battery life only being 18 hours but it actually lasts for more than 24 hours i fully charge my watch each day because i wear it to bed and it only gets down to about 40percent by the time i charge it again the calling and texting from the watch is awesome if you have been on the fence about getting one then get off it and buy one,battery,positive
72,it drains battery so easily can not even last a day maybe it is a defective product planning to return it,battery,positive
73,the quality is in every detail the battery lasts as promised if I use it well during the day I charge it overnight or the next morning very good for notifications and whatsapp calendar calendar until slack they all arrive for running or gym and top to the pool it was also possible to download spotify sounds on it and leave the phone at home,battery,positive
74,"the watch arrived within the promised time with invoice and everything as indicated in the ad the product is very good it is very worth it the only negative point I have noticed so far is the battery that lasts a maximum of 2 days but use for exercises and with medication pulse rate, which consumes a lot of battery charge and is super fast so this is not a problem at all, just praise for the product",battery,positive
75,nice battery life is still short,battery,positive
76,i like it i have wanted one for years and bit the bullet works well for tracking workout activity receiving notifications messages changing selecting music without needing to pull out my phone battery lasts around a day and a half you should plan on having to charge it every day i would say problem you literally cannot charge your watch out of the box if you do not have a usbc charging block i own no devices that utilize this i had to shell out more money after spending dollar350 on this watch this is unacceptable i would understand if there was no charging block for a normal usb plug in everyone has one laying around,battery,negative
77,the watch does everything it promises to do the battery goes all day and still has life left when i go to bed even when the outdoor walk is used the heart monitor has come in handy on several occasions all in all it was well worth purchasing,battery,positive
78,It has served me very well I can use many applications and the battery lasts a long time,battery,positive
79,very dissapointed i took the watch out the box and set it up the battery died and when i put it to charge it never charged so either the battery or the charger not working after i spent so much money on it,battery,negative
80,excellent smart watch with blood pressure measure sleek design and quickly sync with the phone i wish it had a longer battery life like they improved the battery of latest iphones however over all 10 10 for performance design and functionality,battery,positive
81,"arrived with 3 working days from the moment I placed the order, it comes packing with all the accessories that match the description, I bought the 41mm because I looked at the comments before buying and I imagined that the 45mm would be big on my wrist and it fit super well battery lasts about 1 and a half days",battery,positive
82,it took half a day to set up i had to leave it with my iphone within range of wifi and connected to chargers while i downloaded a long series of updates and performed a long series of restarts the battery life is about 18 hours so i need to take it off to charge while i sleep this makes it difficult to use as a sleep monitor and use it as a watch all day the watch is not very useful without being always linked to my iphone now i have to have bluetooth on my iphone always on which sucks battery life also the watch iphone combo made the decision for me that my iphone alerts are now silent and the watch will tap my wrist for alerts after missing a couple appointments i had to disconnect the watch by turning off bluetooth i searched through the hundreds of settings and could not find the one where i gave permission to make decisions about iphone settings without my consents apple does not include power supplies anymore and they switched all there power cords to a new connector so i can not use the 10 old power supplies i have sitting in a drawer seems like a cash grab i guess they are out of ideas for new useful products that would increase sales,battery,negative
83,works great with everything i wanted wish the battery lasted longer worth the buy,battery,positive
84,the battery but i live in a world where a charger is nearby d,battery,negative
85,the battery goes out quickly,battery,negative
86,well it is good to have the watch for the ease to answer texts when phone is in pocket pretty much for what i use it for coming from a garmin 245 love the battery on that watch for sure battery on apple watch is very under performing compared to garmin,battery,positive
87,a great watch good quality good battery heath 100percent but i think it is a bit expensive for what you can really do with it of course we are paying for the brand that is apple but i think the se would be a very good cheaper option and with practically the same functions,battery,positive
88,nice one but the battery drains once it is not being charged whether it is worn or not thus it has to be continuously charged 24 7 not a good one,battery,negative
89,love it it looks great i am upgrading from a series 4 44 mm which i traded back to apple the pulse ox is a nice feature the screen is larger the usb c charges very fast the problem with apple watches is the battery life should last longer i have not tested how long it would last but i would guess 2 days with minimal usage 1 day with daily use,battery,positive
90,i had a series 3 that i had for a few years now i decided to upgrade to the latest and greatest i was not sure which size but i decided i like bigger and hoped it would not look too big on my little wrist it does not i love this watch it works perfect i wish the battery lasted a bit longer but i guess with all its doing it is not bad i get about a day and half from the battery,battery,positive
91,the watch was pretty much what i have come to expect with apple the only downside is the battery life my wife has to charge it daily and she is not running any of the apps,battery,positive
92,disappointed in the battery life my samsung would last 4 days this one two at best,battery,positive
93,very light resistant and with a great battery with fast charging the best smartwatch I know,battery,positive
94,watch is great it does take a little bit to learn but it does work as advertised watch does have a lower battery life but think that it has more to do with the charger then it does the watch,battery,negative
95,the item works fine lots of great features for sure however there were a couple of issues that make this product over priced the first disappointment was that it only comes with half a charger luckily my wife already had a charger the next was that this thing really only has a days worth of battery life i have to take it off so often and forget to put it back on i bought this thing to monitor health which it does very well however i have to take it off to charge every single night which means heart health is not tracked at night for 500 plus dollars this product should come with a charger come on and it should have a better battery going to return it if i can,battery,positive
96,battery is not as should be my other one could last 2 days this one lasts 1 but ok i charge every night anyways sometimes it zooms them self or the touchscreen does not work but most of the time is fine,battery,positive
97,good product but the battery ending fast,battery,positive
98,this is a major upgrade coming from apple watch 3 great battery life super fast processor and excellent health monitoring,battery,positive
99,battery last for about a day as opposed to the fitbit iconic which lasts for 3 days,battery,negative
100,every feature of this watch is spot on purchased for emergency sos and for gps location should i fall or otherwise need help i love the gold stainless case and the ability to have a cellular connectivity as well as pair with my iphone i have had another apple watch aluminum case and liked it very much but wanted a gold stainless case thus the reason for buying this one re sos feature i fell recently and the watch was faster at responding than my fall alert button for which i pay a monthly fee the reason i gave the watch a 4 star review is because i thought i was purchasing a new watch but in fact when it came and i placed it on the charger it became very hot and i realized the battery must be bad so i investigated further and found out it was a refurbished watch good condition am giving a 4 star review only because i am returning the watch due to battery heating up when on charge i will purchase another apple watch new this time,battery,positive
101,great battery life and charges fast,battery,positive
102,because it's practically a cell phone on your arm I thought the battery lasts a lot I use it all day and I still sleep with it original came packaged with invoice arrived 4 days before the deadline and I'm in love,battery,positive
103,battery only lasts for about 22hrs and unable to track sleep which my mickey mouse watch did,battery,negative
104,watch holds battery for a day and a half with constant use and is easy to set up,battery,positive
105,battery life is great and i love the cellular feature,battery,positive
106,the watch arrived with a dead battery after a three hour charge using a usb c charger which i had also purchased the watch remained charged for less than 15 minutes it is charging now overnight but surely a brand new watch battery is supposed to be a little charged then recharge easily after 4 days it now recharges fine the ecg app is extremely poor and blood oxgen is very slow compared to pulse oximeter i bought for these features apple does say not for medical purposes i am not a fitness freak i am learning to use features that require purchase of additional software that helps me pay attention to your purposes for buying this watch i hated it but have learned to use certain additional software to my benefit and am having no more battery problems so i am now pleased,battery,positive
107,works great and i love all the features battery life could be better i still have to charge every day and it is also heavier than i would prefer,battery,positive
108,i got this as a gift from my wife for my birthday and i love it i had an apple watch series 2 that stopped working a bit over a year ago my wife got me this to replace it the jump from series 2 to 7 was dramatic i did research to find out exactly what was different and i was disappointed to find out that it still had an 18 hour battery life however through my experience it can last closer to 30 hours per charge but i do only use it as a watch and occasionally a timer so i imagine that having an influence on battery life it also was fully connected and updated within an hour and came with about 80 percent battery life the only downside is that it does not come with a charging brick however this is standard for apple as they stopped including bricks years ago you still get the cable though all in all i love it and i love the deep red color that this watch is,battery,positive
109,battery does not last a full 24 hours so this interrupts my day,battery,negative
110,the product came in immaculate condition and arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected on the watch itself it is very practical and helps me a lot to control health issues such as the daily rings where you set a goal of hours standing exercise and burning of calories and when you complete these 3 goals you get some prizes and that motivates me a lot it also comes with 3 free months of the fitness apple exercise app the apple watch 7 home screens in my opinion are wonderful also the battery doesn't last so long usually lasts 1 and a half day for me but the recharge is absurdly fast you can go from 5percent to 90percent in 30 minutes a negative side is that it comes without the charger source which is different from the normal source but it is not very difficult to find on the internet at Overall the product is worth it for the functionality and practicality in addition to the apple system integration that is simply wonderful,battery,positive
111,gave my daughter for christmas battery life is great and the watch is very accurate my daughter loves it,battery,positive
112,looking thru all the reviews and most of the negative ones are about battery life not satisfactory i have tested my apple watch series 7 with not having the always on display and found that if i turn that setting off i only burn 25 30percent battery in a full work day 10 hrs i do not know about you but if i am not looking at my watch why would i need the display on when you turn always on display feature off watch display comes on only when you look at it immediately and that is perfect for me just go to display and brightness on your phone in the apple watch app and turn off always on think about if your phone had a setting where it was always onit would be dead in no time and everyone would be complaining the battery does not last,battery,negative

123,only last about 10 hrs 11hrs before wanting to be charged which is frustrating and makes me not wanting to wear it why would anyone want to keep charging a watch apple must step up their game watches should last a few days especially if ur trying to use it for safety while out and about makes their recent commercials seems like bs,battery,positive

128,i bought this watch because i am 67 years old totally disabled in a power chair and i fall a lot i also have heart problems which is why i bought it for that also unfortunately the batteries not even lasting 11 hours and it goes totally dead i have tried everything it is fully updated i disconnected it reconnected it shut things down and what good is it if i can not run the things that i need i always liked apple products but this watch it definitely needs a stronger battery or something else it is just not worth the money i paid for it if i could i would return it,battery,positive

130,this is my first iwatch and gifted to me for my birthday main complaint is that the battery last less than a day probably only 12 hours i do minimal usage of the watch and do not find it useful after all that i have gone back to wearing my citizen solar watch for accurate team keeping the regular citizen watch is always there for what i need most time keeping i use iwatch in power save mode to show only time very disappointed with the purchase,battery,negative
131,have not even had it is month and the battery is already going extremely quick i thought it was going rather quick from the beginning and i guess i was right because now it will not even last a day it is also starting to freeze up on certain screens and if it is already starting to do that there is more and worse to come i will be retuning it,battery,negative
132,i cannot give this a high enough rating it is fantastic the only down side is the 18 hour battery life between charging,battery,positive
