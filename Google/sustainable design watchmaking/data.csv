"Hey, HODINKEE! Day-Date Day Wheels, Ethical Quandaries, Second Hand Counterweights, And A Question You Shouldn't Even Have To Ask"
Hands-On Japanese Microbrand Mirco Uses Color To Tell A Story
Hands-On TAG Heuer Looks To The 1970s – And Nails It – With The New Orange Diver

"And no, we're not talking about dial colors."
"Twenty twenty-one has been the year of the green watch, and not just in dial colors ranging from lime to pine. While the young year has for sure yielded a heaping helping of green dials, it's also marked what looks like a pivotal movement for sustainability in the watch industry."
"Mechanical watches are inherently sustainable objects, intended to last decades or longer and even outlive their original owners.Taking the concept one step further, watchmakers are looking to integrate sustainable manufacturing methods where they can, using technologies and practices ranging from solar energy to recycling."
"It isn't always easy being green, as a famous frog once said. For an industry steeped in luxury and permanence, rummaging in the recycling bin to build new products might not always seem quite on brand. But times and consumer tastes are changing."
"This Earth Day, let's take a look at some of the sustainable watchmaking products that launched in 2021."
"If you really must make a watch with quartz, why not power it with the sun? Cartier's new SolarBeat Tank Must does just that, packing cool green tech into a design that's about as classic as any shaped watch could possibly be."
"While mechanical watches are of course inherently green, getting their energy from a turn of the crown or a flick of the wrist, quartz has long relied on disposable batteries to get the job done. With SolarBeat, Cartier delivers the accuracy and value consumers tend to expect from quartz while providing a compelling green approach to the end product. In keeping with the theme of sustainability, the Cartier straps you see here have been manufactured using scraps of apples grown for the food industry."
"The Cartier Tank Must SolarBeat, $2,480 (small), $2,610 (large)"
The Panerai Submersible eLAB-ID
"Panerai made sustainability its main focus at Watches & Wonders, debuting a 30-piece limited-edition concept watch in the Submersible line with 98.6 percent recycled-based materials. Along with the new Submersible concept, the most recycled timepiece we've seen to date, Panerai also published its list of suppliers and the specific contributions of each company to the final product you see here. This intentional open-sourcing of the product is an invitation for other watchmakers to do likewise and up their sustainability game. The impact of just one model from one – albeit popular and high-profile – luxury watchmaker can only go so far, after all."
The Panerai Luminor Marina eSteel.
"On the commercial side of things, Panerai debuted a new alloy, eSteel, that allows it to make recycled-based watches for commercial release. The Luminor Marina eSteel, available this October, may not use 98.6% recycled-based materials by weight (89 grams of its components use recycled-based materials, accounting for 58.4% of the total weight), but it demonstrates that circular manufacturing is viable at a larger scale for luxury watchmakers."
"The Panerai Submersible eLAB-ID, limited to 30 pieces and available in 2022: $60,000; the Panerai Luminor Marina eSteel, $8,700."
"The Swatch watch, launched in 1983, went a long way toward demonstrating that quartz, plastic, and Swiss manufacturing could not only co-exist but thrive. Crafting watches with familiar methods wasn't the mindset that put Swatch on the map, and it's not how the brand has operated over the last 38 years. Recently, Swatch has looked to make watches from bio-derived materials."
"With the BioCeramic, launched as a capsule collection a couple of weeks ago, Swatch has made a watch of mixed ceramic (⅔) and bio-derived plastic (⅓). The plastic portion is made using the seeds of the castor plant. Available in simple black and white as well as blue, pink and grey, each will set you back $125. It’s proof that sustainability doesn't have to cost lots of money."
Bioceramic Big Bold Next: $125
"Shortly before Watches & Wonders, IWC announced a line of sustainable straps made from a paper-based material called TimberTex. Composed of 80% natural plant fibers and handmade with natural dyes in Italy, TimberTex straps can be added to select IWC Portugieser and Portofino models."
"IWC began looking into high-quality alternatives for leather-based straps in 2018, with the goal of finding a material that was both vegan and green. The cellulose in the straps comes from managed forests or tree farms, and the stitching and lining from recycled materials."
"Perhaps most interesting, the TimberTex straps are water resistant. Water resistance isn't something that can be claimed for your run of the mill leather strap. Score one for sustainability. IWC's TimberTex straps are offered in blue, brown and black."
IWC TimberTex Straps $175.
"Just in time for Earth Day, we've got a new collection of watches in Skagen's Aaren Naturals line that feature cases made from at least 50% recycled steel; cork or 100%  recycled paper dials; and straps made of mulberry, apple, cork or cotton backed with LWG nubuck. The straps feature the same construction as Skagen's traditional leather straps, but or the first time, they feature what Skagen refers to as ""pro-planet materials."" Skagen says that the leather-alternative straps made with cork and apple also include man-made materials. The three-hand, quartz-powered Aaren Naturals watches come in 40 and 36mm sizes."
Skagen Aaren Naturals: $125.
"Earlier today, in honor of Earth Day, the HODINKEE Shop launched its own line of vegan ""leather"" straps. The Amagoh collection comes in five colors, each named after a U.S. National Park: Kilauea (black), Carlsbad Caverns (dark brown), Mesa Verde (mid-brown, above), Glacier Bay (blue), and Death Valley (reddish clay). The new straps are truly vegan, made entirely of pineapple plant fibers, and 100 percent biodegradable. For the full details on how these cool pineapple straps are made, check out this story in the HODINKEE Shop Journal."
Amagoh Straps from the HODINKEE Shop: $110.

Solutions to a problem that really doesn't exist.
"As president of the board of the Mondaine group and responsible person for sustainability I admit not having been communicating well enough... hodinkee missed our company when writing this article.
I appreciate that some brands are doing at least some efforts, but many just want to hopp on a fast riding train. 
Mondaine has been active in sustainability for almost 50 years with a proven track record, has become entirely co2/climate neutral in 2020 as probably the 1st watch company worldwide, including all components, shipping of them, factory, HQ, traveling etc added in the eco balance, for all its brands Mondaine, luminox, M-Watch and pierre cardin. We produce our own electricity on our swiss factory roof, and yes we are reducing, reusing and recycling. We developed in 2016 the probably most ecological watch worldwide, the Mondaine essence, made of castor oil compound etc, and eg luminox tide made of ocean plastic. 
Obviously I don't appreciate when other speak up loudly about their great sustainable brand but doing eg only a strap which uses some bio material. Or, did you ever see a ceramic plant which then can do a bio ceramic watch case ... common, ridiculous, and misleading wording. 
Check our sustainability report, open and transparent communication. I don't say we are ,good, but we are getting better and better, and intend to lead the way and proof to other brands that we can do much more and better, step by step. If a SME family owned company like ours can push sustainability, the big guys companies can and must do it too, or even better!? Tks"
"Why is a Cartier solar priced above 2k when Citizen, who has perfected solar technology, offers their timepieces for less than 1k? Apart from buying the name Cartier, what am I paying for?"
"Who are we kidding? We slap a green label on it and suddenly it's ok to go buy a dozen?
All you do by slapping the sustainable label on it is letting people virtue signal while continuing unsustainable behavior. 
It's like a dieter wolfing down a carton of ""low-calorie ice cream"". 
""Yeah but it's soooo much better than the full calorie stuff!! It's better than regular!"" 
""No, what you're doing is still fundamentally unsustainable. You've adopted the diet ice cream as a solution and now are failing to confront the actual issue while pretending like you have"""
"Great article! I think this is a very important topic and should be touched upon even more. A curiosity of mine also extends to how watch companies are manufacturing in a ""green way"" as well as giving back to the planet. No single watch is going to fix anything, but starting a conversation will! Looking forward to more content like this!"
"I think it's great that the watches are more eco friendly and a 16 year solar cell (as in the Cartier) is to be applauded but what I have a problem with is....
We recycled, but are still going to charge you a hefty Swiss luxury price for something we made from apple peel scraps! Then there is a certain brand doing the same for making a watch out of (gasp!) aluminium. The marketing is such that because it's a big brand name you should feel like you are getting good value. The reality is nobody feels like an expensive Swiss omelette or sausage purchased at a Swiss railway station is good value just because it's Swiss.
Also, there is zero information about accuracy for the solar movement compared to mechanical or regular quartz and none of the watch websites seem to have bothered to ask. I mean, we can all assume the movement is accurate enough, but why no specs. for what is an expensive watch?
When the battery powered Santos Dumont came out I personally went to the Cartier Boutique to ask how much a replacement battery might cost and they had no idea.
Eco friendly is good but as a buyer I'm not dazzled by it. Am I the only one that thinks like this?"
"Fawning over the Cartier solar watch as though Citizen, Casio, Seiko, Pulsar and several others haven't existed for what, 30 years?

All companies, whatever they make, should, if they are serious, also set out clearly on their websites whatever compliance measures they have in place to ensure - not for marketing, but for real - that their supply chains are free of forced or exploited labour, that their contractors adhere to the same strict requirements, and so own right down through their supply chain to the raw ingredients that go into their products. For watches this should include where they source their precious metals."
"Bravo to all the companies who are developing anything that results in less of an impact on the planet. Nice to know they have acknowledged they too are part of the problem and are at the very least thinking about sustainability. Change is hard when you try to create proprietary materials new designs. The market and commenters will always respond be it good or bad.

I'm thankful there will always be a vintage market. But I am also thinking I might have enough watches for one lifetime. The amount of packaging material used to ship all the watches I have purchased in the last 25 years would astound even me. The bubble wrap and clear packing tape alone is shameful. I have recycled boxes and reused the majority I think, but thinking I might focus on making a list of the non-working watches to have serviced by a local watchmaker I just found and enjoying them instead of buying more. 
I just typed this while wearing a watch that UPS delivered 30 minutes ago... so going cold turkey might be a wait and see."
"All you need to know about so called global warming, climate change or whatever word salad you choose, can be summed up by George Carlin. Wear you watch in good health however green it is or isn't."
"Lol what about Citizen Eco-Drive, Casio Tough Solar, and Seiko solar? You missed the 3 watchmakers who have been doing it all along!"
"This in CO2 penny pinching and virtue signalling at its worst. Producing watches has a negligible impact on the environment. Instead, look at overpopulation, eating (too much) meat, cheap air travel, inefficient transportatin and resistance to nuclear power (including underinvestment in fusion research) as the main problems."
Could I care less? Probably not.
This comment no longer exists.
"Are you a scientist? Do you understand why CO2 is an issue? Something is telling me you are no more qualified to discuss this than a political scientist, maybe even only a journalist."
"Alright, you have both said your piece. Let's keep the focus on the substance of the article."
"I’ve been going green for years! Vintage or slightly used watches instead of new, no car since 1994, no TV since 1999 and my computer is now 6 years old and still works fine. 
Last time I flew was in 2016 and the time before that 2001 and live in a tiny house in the woods. Has suited me and will continue, always felt like a slave to stuff before and found it had far to much say in my freedom.

I do think the best thing that is real that a watch company can do is to go back to simple packaging, think how many tons of fuel a year Panerai could save by not having its boxes made in China and then having to ship them to their factory in Switzerland or Omega, up until a few years ago you would get a simple red box, back in 1980 when I had a manual wind deville for my 18th birthday the box was even smaller, just enough to present the watch with the papers tucked under the cushion. Now it seems they have gone the gargantuan box route the others have!

I might have been tempted by the ceramic swatch if they had not made it in that huge 47mm case, hopefully next year they bring a ceramic cased large gents size as the movement in the 47mm is exactly the same as in the 40mm, might tempt me to buy a new watch for the first time in years, add in a solar cell movement it would be even better!

As for all the hoopla about a light powered Cartier, anyone would think it a brand new idea! A steel watch with pretty cheap quartz solar powered movement on a pleather strap, I love Cartier but this really is taking the wee wee quite a bit for what they want or it! I will stick with my vintage manual wind example and save the planet even more!"
All that minimalism and no chicken coup? Gotta get the chickens.
Oh this is going to feed the ones who don’t like my post ! I’m a life long vegetarian but down to food allergies not choice so no chicken soup for me! :)
"Well, you can always let them roam your garden. They are great for aerating soil and snatching up bugs that may harm the veggies. Chickens FTW!"
"More the year that the watch industry gets really good at greenwashing.

Generally the greenest watch is the one that one already has, but nobody in the business of selling watches will make that admission.

Particularly the Panerai is a joke, and shows the lack of literacy with regard to recycling.

Recycling is a big issue for single use plastics because they are difficult to recycle, and degrade in quality when recycled. Really the only answer is to use less plastic, not to hope it can be recycled.

On the other hand metallic elements like those used in the Panerai “green” watches are infinitely recyclable, and are very heavily recycled. There is nothing impressive about recycling gold, titanium, or even steel. There is a reason metal has a scrap value. Show me the garbage dump or ocean patch full of gold and titanium and I will thank you for the business opportunity."
There's no larger issue facing humanity. We've had enough warnings. Take heed or ignore at our own peril. . Take immediate action now or face the dire consequences.
"Or, you can watch George Carlin for a brief lesson on climate."
"Brands wasting resources and millions of $ in printing ads, lighting up their empty shops 24h a day, setting up seasonal fancy storefront displays, etc, are now worried about their environment footprint? Seems like another marketing ploy to me"
"""Is 2021 The Year Watchmaking Truly Goes Green?""

They've always went for our green, now they just use the environment instead of horological prowess as an excuse."
"For your (and Hodinkee editors team) information: ""Vegan leather"" does not exist and in fact the term ""vegan leather"" is forbidden by law. This is also true for other combinations such as ""pineapple leather"". Leather always refers to an animal skin product."
"Oh Rupert... what's your beef with vegans? Did they ever let you down at a party by not eating that juicy steak you seared on the grill?
As always in this cases a quick search at Amazon shows over 10.000 items named ""vegan leather"" and lawyer Google can't find nowhere to be seen any law against the terminology ""vegan leather"".

In fact the only dispute I could find was a lawsuit from a leather company in Germany against the use of the term. The result was:

""Regina Henkelof Fashion United writes that in its judgment of 10th September 2019, the German district court in Hanover decided that it is not misleading to consumers when handbag manufacturers label vegan products with the terms ‘vegan leather’ or ‘apple leather’.""

So can we get back to the 20th century and stop complaining about semantics? I love my crocodile boots and belts, I'm a huge fan of Kangaroo and Ostrich leather. But not for once would I care about the term being used by a plastic equivalent, when clearly labelled."
"Just to make clear: I don't care as well. However, there are certainly people and companies that do and we should respect them and not get back to the 20th century. Correctness does not wear a date. A black white horse does not exist and so does vegan leather. 
But it's certainly interesting to see that my rather neutral statement provoked some prejudice that I might be against (or pro?) vegans. The reason might be that my mother tongue is not English..."
? What prejudice? You went from ranting against vegan leather to the defensive ethnical stance in two comments just because I called you out on your reference that it was illegal to use the name vegan leather... that's the thinnest skin I've read in these shores.
"So, does his thin skin make you less likely to recycle Rupert into a watch strap, or is that the suppleness we all desire?"
"Its harder and harder for me to wear leather-anything on a daily basis. For indoor seated events (opera, theatre, a conference) I use it but most of the time here on the yacht or on shore it just crumples too hard, even the ones with the interior in rubber or others).

A Mexican friend once showed me an heirloom that consisted of some human leather bands (they were a memento of a deceased relative and were meant to be used in the Día de Muertos) and it was pretty supple stuff, very enjoyable.


Although an avid Thomas Harris reader, I would leave Rupert's skin untouched."
"Agreed’ vegan leather does not exist and the term is forbidden by law, at least in France. (Decret 2010-29; article214-1)
It causes prejudice to the leather industry. The majority of the leather used is actually the recycling/upcycling of otherwise disposed skins of animal we have eaten)"
"You're 100% right. In France they really defend their leather. Have a like.

""I. ― L'utilisation du mot « cuir », à titre principal ou de racine ou sous forme d'adjectif, quelle que soit la langue utilisée, est interdite dans la désignation de toute autre matière que celle obtenue de la peau animale au moyen d'un tannage ou d'une imprégnation conservant la forme naturelle des fibres de la peau."""
"As noted in the article, high quality wristwatches are inherently sustainable. 
A plant-based watch strap is no more sustainable than a leather one. There is already a vegan alternative, the bracelet. 
Most of the above is virtue-signalling marketing."
"While I agree with most of your statement, the sentence ""A plant-based watch strap is no more sustainable than a leather one"" is completely nonsense. A complete life cycle assessment of leather and plant based materials shows significant differences in: CO2 production, water consumption, human toxicity, eutrophication, water use and use of fossil fuels. The differences are are gigantic between leather and natural fiber products (and also recycles PET, by the way)."
Greta will address the Congress! Maybe she is wearing a 60k eco friendly panerai. How cool south at be? Lol
Ever get the feeling she's the only adult in the room?
No.
I rest my case
So do I :)
"OMG. If I want “green” I’d purchase a sundial, and if I want to make a statement I’ll put a sign on my lawn. Let’s stick to great horology and worth - none of these watches will hold their value."
This *is* sticking to horology. This is a trend in watches that is worth highlighting. Whether you agree with it doesn't invalidate the direction.
"There is something rather hypocritical about a 'green' watch. It is almost an oxymoron. Noone actually 'needs' a watch if they have a smartphone, let alone 5 - so why waste earth's resources on them at all. If you want to be green dont wear a watch...."
"What “invalidates” this is the simple fact that you have absolutely no data to support than any of this is “sustainable.” Take for example farming trees for faux-leather. Environmentalists have long pointed out that this sort of agriculture, like Christmas tree farming, is environmentally harmful. First, these farms are monocultures that reduce biodiversity in the ecologies where they are planted, rendering them unstable and unhealthy. Second, harvesting, processing and transport of wood products is energy and fuel intensive. Third, you’ve no idea of the working conditions associated with this sort of commercial enterprise. This is pure marketing, and the only “green” here is the cash proffered by the gullible."
I can’t wait for the solar Tank. I haven’t been this excited since the 3861 and before that I can’t remember when. Plan to buy his and hers.
"Maybe I am being skeptical, but I feel like there's a group directive for Richemont brands to market themselves being 'Green'. IWC when Georges Kern was still CEO was starting to make the pivot, and he took that initiative with him to Breitling (which, is a good thing at the end of the day). But I can't help but feel that it's not something the brands themselves would have gravitated to naturally without some encouragement from the head honcho at Richemont."
Isn’t that what head honchos are for?
"Great to see this type of progress in watchmaking even though it may be driven largely by marketing. The change to recycled materials and vegan strap options is nice to see. I echo what others are saying here that owning mechanical watches for extended years is much better than ""upgrading"" yearly to the latest greatest Apple watch."
What about the Alpine Eagle line?
"I’ve never thought of a quartz watch, but that Cartier doesn’t have a seconds hand so maybe this could be the time to go quartz!"
The greenest practice would be to maintain the watches we already own.
Please stay out of political issues. I come here to get away from all of that.
Couldn’t agree more!
"The environment shouldn't be a political issue. Also, this is Hodinkee reporting on a trend within the watch industry, it's literally their job."
"If not politicians, who do you suggest should fix climate change and global warming?"
I'm afraid this is an issue that cannot be ignored and will be impossible to ignore. It's a humanitarian crisis. This is about our very existence on this planet.
"i should have said religion, not politics. Because no matter what conclusion you draw from the evidence it entirely rests on faith - it is a belief system."
Speechless..
Denial is a powerful thing.
"Love the effort, but being green or being environmentally responsible doesn’t only mean building watches or straps from recyclable materials, but also building products the right way to last for decades."
"I'd actually love it if Hodinkee gave me an option to receive straps in a simple padded envelope (maybe a recyclable one, even?)

The last time I ordered straps from the shop, they came in a sturdy, oversized box with a soft-touch finish, magnetic clasp, and foam insert. The box was in a plastic bag inside the actual shipping box, which was stuffed full of paper. I did have the thought, 'this is excessive.' I'm not gonna keep the strap forever, or save the box for resale.

I know that this won't save the planet, but hey, you brought it up! 😉"
"I’ve also found this. It’s nice packaging, but I can do without it. I’ve never had a strap damaged in a normal USPS cardboard envelope."
I love that solar tank minus the vegan leather. It's really cool how the solar panels are the roman numerals. But I need my leather from animal hide.
My wife’s question: how long does it take for those biodegradable straps to degrade? I am not allowed to be wearing such a strap when that happens.
"If i pay for a luxury item, i dont need/care it to recycled. I want it to be either durable, precious or rare."
The most environmentally friendly thing to happen to the luxury watch world was the collapse of the needless big tradeshows. Their demise saved millions of air miles.
"very true, the fake plastic-techno-textile straps and come complex material mix are rather the opposite of ecological.

aside from the hard stop on air miles the biggest impact ecologically is:
- getting a standard production movement fitted
- vintage watch
- have it serviced
- have it repaired
- buy the local one-man-show watchmaker of trust

manufactures, exotic materials, new production of 3-10day / year use devices is a shame on the wrist of a climate conscious person and proof that person isn't.

cheers"
There can be no such thing as a modern luxury good that's environmentally friendly. The concept is a farce. But it does make for a fantastic marketing angle these days.
"That’s a complete cop-out argument akin to: well we can’t make a car with a petrol engine completely pollution-free, so we might as well not bother to make the emissions cleaner at all!

Lmfao 🤦🏻‍♂️"
"I believe you're misinterpreting my opinion. More accurately, your analogy should read: ""well we can’t make a car with a petrol engine completely pollution-free, so we might as well not bother to make them and switch to clean energy motors instead"". Which I would agree with. You're welcome to disagree, but would you mind polishing your logic here? How may I help you?"
"So what’s your electric car/engine, here?"
"It's your analogy, not mine. But something along the lines of Stanley Meyers's water powered car concept."
"I find it amusing when global companies producing products that people don't need make out they are concerned about the environment. These people travel the world on business (and no doubt for pleasure) and then tell us what they are doing to reduce their carbon footprint by using recycled materials etc in their products. Products that nobody needs because they are 'luxury' goods. 

If you were that concerned about the environment, you would live on a small farm, grow your own food and have your own animals etc and be self sufficient. Not be self-indulgent."
"I know, we all don't want to hear it, but ""consuming less"" is the better answer, not ""buying *eco-friendly* luxury goods""."
"I've sat in many meetings in recent years where corporate execs talk about how to position their company to take advantage of the green trend. Not many of them have the ability to just raise the price on their product by 600% like Panerai does though. I realize that a large part of the cost is the R&D expenses that they are passing along to their customers so I am interested in whether they have the ability to significantly reduce the price of the watch if they go to full production. Otherwise this 30 piece LE is just a token effort.
They're not going to get many people to spend the equivalent of the price of a gold watch for recycled steel."
"Did Hodinkee ever find out about the secretive Panerai 9010 'Evolution' movement? They removed stop seconds and not sure what else, I heard the decoration is less costly too. Hodinkee, please find out as Panerai refuses to tell their customers about it. Thx."
"All of these companies would have a bigger environmental impact by removing plastic forks from their corporate cafeterias.

Marketing a $60k watch for recycled steel is a farce. Almost 100% of the steel in the world is recycled already."
"Have you ever been to one of the above mentioned corporate cafeterias (serious question!)? And if yes, which one? 

I have been in three of them and none is using plastic forks. And I can tell you that these companies do a whole list of other good/sustainable things. No matter how small the impact may be, it is certainly good to start somewhere..."
"Cartier making their straps from apples, now Hodinkee's from pineapples....I'd say its becoming a lot more fruity."
That’s nuts.
"Now look what you did, we got full-on trail mix on our hands"
"I appreciate that brands are largely focusing on watch production for their sustainability efforts. I’d suggest that other aspects of the industry could be also adjusted for both positive commercial and environmental impact:

1. I used to collect catalogues every year from my favorite brands—the beautiful photography and lavish production value made them collectibles in and of themselves. But looking at my bookshelf and all of the catalogues I haven’t touched in years, I wonder if there’s a better way to do marketing. Rather than paper catalogues, which use natural resources to produce and are very heavy to ship, I’d love to see brands hand out Google Cardboard-type VR goggles and invite customers to explore their world online in a dynamic and interactive way. The experiences could be activated by QR so that they require customers to visit a boutique and brands wouldn’t lose foot traffic. 

2. Rolex has a page on their .org site dedicated to environmental conservation projects they sponsor (https://www.rolex.org/environment). Sure, it could be greenwashing, but it’s a fact that their financial support helps people and projects who in turn seek to legitimately help the environment. Making a watch case out of recycled materials is great, but it’s profoundly inspiring to see how people are dedicating their lives to the future of the planet (and its people). I’d love to see more brands showcase such financial sponsorships over celebrity endorsements. 

3. As another commenter noted below, packaging for watches is often excessive. They’re not necessary to begin with, they take up far too much space, and both their production and shipment leave a carbon footprint. Functionally, they’re little more than a collector’s tchotchke—surely the industry can imagine a more interesting and sustainable totem for collectors to enjoy (though I’d submit that the watch itself should be enough).

4. We as consumers have a voice in the direction watch brands take and we should use it. If we all wanted a watch case made out of toxic sludge, some watch brand out there would make it. But if we say we want sustainability, the brands will seek to execute on it. I can already see that some readers are rolling their eyes at this article. But many of us do care about environmental conservation—I hope the brands take our lead."
Are you suggesting that we dispense with box and papers? What are the flippers gonna do then?
"Wake me when the Swiss Watch Industry agrees to full disclosure as to how they source their precious metals. 

All this stuff, just virtue signaling and low-hanging marketing moves."
"Sincere question, not trying to troll or pick a fight: Is there an action that a corporate entity could take for the benefit of environmental conservation that you wouldn’t dismiss as just marketing?"
"Yes. For the entire watch industry, full disclosure as to how they source their precious metals. Then I will believe they are serious. 

But $15K recycled steel (which can be more carbon-intensive than non-recycled steel, depending), solar instead of a quartz battery and non-leather straps is little more than playing footsie at the margins."
"The most sustainable watch is the one already on your wrist. The second, buy vintage. I don't want to be too pessimistic about this supposed trend towards sustainability, but it would be interesting to know what is the actual quantifiable effect of using these recycled/plant based materials, especially since the watch market is just a sliver of global industry. I would think the greatest improvements possible would be in the embodied energy of these watches, such as the energy necessary to power the forges, machines, and buildings during the manufacturing process, not necessarily simply using recycled materials. In other words, get production to carbon neutral. 

I suspect watches will one day come with a digital NFT certificate in an effort to eliminate any ambiguity and funny business about provenance and authenticity. The NFT will contain all the info typically found in an extract from the archives, along with a record of ownership. Any of these blockchain based ledgers will consume vast amounts of energy and any notion of sustainability will go out the window. 

In conclusion, I believe humanity is doomed unless we invent cold fusion and can escape the eventual death of the sun through inter-galactic travel. At which point the wrist watch will be truly anachronistic, since years, months, days, hours, minutes will be based on a solar system that we once called home. But how dope would it be if one of those space-farers has a mechanical watch on their wrist? A vestigial memento of all the lives that circled our original star."
"Bud, the sun still has some billion years to live. And while fusion might be the better solution, fission is a mature and dare I say safe technology for now, but one that lobbyists from the left have maligned in the eyes of the public."
The sun has around 5 billion years left. I admire your optimism thinking humans will still exist then.
"Good Sirs, you have upsetti my spaghetti"
"So glad the watch industry is getting on board with saving our planet! Thought I’d share a note I’ve sent to Panerai:

Dear Sirs and Madams,

Please find in the enclosed box( recycled of course) my old titanium backpacking stove, a polyethylene water bottle, a couple of brass faucet stems(I never throw anything away!) , some sapphires from my grandmothers jewelry box, as well as an old bottle of lume paint left over from painting a constellation on my daughters ceiling. Sufficient material I believe to up cycle at least one , maybe two watches. Thank you for your good work!!! 


P.S. when it comes time to ship them, please do not use air mail or container ship ( that would totally defeat the purpose!). You could use a sailboat or maybe one of those guys that rows across the Atlantic once in a while, I’m in no hurry. Thanks Again!"
The last Patek is incredible! what is the reference?

"it also means you have tastes similar to Nicholas Foulkes and the great Paul Pluta (as do i, evidently)"
I guess it's a step in a good direction but it means absolutely nothing when choosing the next timepiece.
Whether watch companies are actually becoming aware of environmental issues or whether they just produce these watches for marketing purposes... if in the end the products are produced in a more sustainable way that’s a good thing I think.
Watches used to be one of those rare pleasures that miraculously seemed to have escaped greenery’s patronising embrace...
"I’m more concerned about excessive packaging. Why can’t companies give us a travel pouch of some sort, rather than a giant box I need to find closet space for? Right now, my watch boxes form a platform that my various climbing shoes are stacked on, so literally just taking up space that they don’t need to."
Very good point.
"True, true, I wouldn't mind that. It is because they are luxury goods and there is a sense of occasion when buying a watch. If you're dropping multiple 10Ks on a watch, a travel pouch would be a little underwhelming for most. In terms of space, you could throw them away of course, but you would probably lose upwards of 20% of the resale value. I like the old school small wooden Rolex boxes myself. I also noticed the new SpeedyPro doesn't come in that ginormous box anymore."
"But see, here’s the problem even with that resale value argument: even if it didn’t devalue my watches to get rid of their boxes, I’d still have to figure out a way to recycle the ridiculous wood, plastic, felt, and cardboard boxes that most brands give out. I’d rather not have to do that at all. Who on earth is actually using their watch boxes?

I greatly enjoy brands like Halios and Coros that package their watches in Pelican cases (or similar). Those are legitimately useful. Ditto Oak & Oscar and others that package their watches in watch rolls/travel cases.

I just wish Rolex, Omega, et al would follow suit."
Minimize use of plastics....good. Embracing anything resembling a political agenda in order to pander to customers....bad. IMO....
"Who cares? Just reduce consumption and waste. If it doesn’t genuinely add value to the watch, why are we getting it with our watches? Just so when we sell it the other person can feel a little better that we didn’t throw it away?"
"I agreed with your above comment. I really like the Pelican Case my new Unimatic U3-F came in....even tho it is plastic. At least it can be re-purposed and, as you say, adds some value to the watch. It's not just useless plastic packaging."
"Agreed. I’d much rather a boutique have a nice presentation tray if they want to do something to make it feel special, but give me something practical to carry the watch in. A pelican case is genuinely one of the more useful things you could give as a watch box.

Otherwise, give me a small canvas/suede/leather pouch to keep the watch in that can also double as a glasses case, pen holder, or cable organizer for my work bag. There are lots of options to add value."
"So, why don’t you throw/recycle your boxes already?"
Don’t want to sound rude but if you question packaging you haven’t understood the core of the luxury market.
If packaging is the core of the luxury market that needs to change. And the change does not need to diminish luxury.
"What isn’t green about any mechanical watch?

As long as we keep products, use them until the end of their life, we are very green."
This comment no longer exists.
"While I am typing on my Iphone 5 SE I am wondering which Mazda. I drive a boring lease from the company but still love the MX5, RX7 and RX8. Especially the engine in the RX’s are cool."
"Nothing wrong with that, one of my friend’s has one. I cannot say anything bad about a Mazda, had a 20 year old Opel Astra sedan.

Driving manual is at least fun. I had more fun driving a Nissan Micra stick shift in the mountains than a nice Volkswagen Passat in the same mountains. For the Nissan I had to work."
RX’s engine maintenance is a nightmare...
"Completely true, but that doesn’t make the engine less interesting."
Rolex is very carbon neutral at my local AD.
underrated comment right here.
Sustainability isn't the word that comes to mind with the $60k Submersible.
This comment no longer exists.
It will all even out if you buy a Skagen each time you refresh the page.
"Server farms, i.e. the cloud, is actually better for the environment than every business spinning up their own servers. Hodinkee runs on AWS, which has a commitment to run on 100% renewable energy worldwide by 2025 (and is already the largest global purchaser of renewable energy). 

So given that in the 21st century human civilization is built on the pervasiveness of computing in every aspect of our lives (including in this case Hodinkee), the environmental impact of cloud computing is no longer the serious concern it was even 2-3 years ago."
Haha!
"Yeah, renewable, like those tree-guzzling plants up north..."
"Sub 3K for the solar Cartier is a great product. The Panerai with the Internet Explorer ""e"" - not so much"
Sub $300 for a solar Citizen tank looks even better and they have been at the solar game a heck of a lot longer! Amazing how it costs to print a name on a luxury watch dial these days!
No.
Go green: Make sure all 9 cars in your garage are electric and each has a few sets of recycled tires.

"The issue of transparency in watchmaking is moving from the fringes to the mainstream, thanks to a focus by younger collectors on sustainability. Yet the lack of standards is worrying. We look at the issues, and propose a modest compromise."
"It may be strange to find this written anywhere, but this moment in time is perhaps still too early to ask questions about sustainability in watchmaking. Not premature mind you, just a little too early to get useful answers. It is the useful answers part there that informed the decision to begin this section with caveats."
"On the face of it, given that climate change is progressing no matter our perspective on it, the discussion on this subject is still at the start line. For example, the industry has just about come around to the idea that the origins of the materials used to make the watches are key. As far as we know, the first public discussion of the realities of the supply chain was at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (now called Watches & Wonders) in 2019. "
"Unfortunately, this is not an indication that watchmaking is ahead of the game here because public reports, including the World Wildlife Fund had already called for greater transparency in this regard as early as 2018, as we dig into elsewhere in this section."
"Prior to this, some watchmaking maisons were talking about how their new manufactures were carbon neutral, and of course their support for various causes. These days though, just these steps will fall short of the mark, at best. At worst, they open the industry to accusations of greenwashing. This is really a shame because a lot of good work is being done, or supported by watchmaking brands. "
"Typically, we avoid watchmaking industry insider stories in favour of those with a stronger relevance to consumers – collectors and enthusiasts like you, in other words. There is a good reason to care about transparency and sustainability for all of us though, and it can summed up in one word: cost."
"Not only will prices of Swiss watches likely rise as companies add measures and oversight to cope with regulatory pressures, there may be environmental and reputational costs as well. Just think about how you would feel about your watch if the brand that made it was found to be supporting forced labour in gold mines, or contributing to the degradation of the environment thanks to the practices of some random supplier. It happens in fashion all the time, after all. "
"The Deloitte Swiss Watch Industry Study 2020 notes that more than 50 per cent of consumers surveyed said that sustainability was very important to them, so the cost of not running afoul of this group will certainly be worth it. It seems from the report that the so-called Millenials and Gen Z groups care even more about sustainability than other age groups. We will be referring to this report and its findings quite extensively in this story."
"We pause here for a moment to congratulate Chopard on having the foresight and the will to do better, as far as the gold they are using goes. The brand’s Fairmined initiative back in 2013 was the first effort by a major watch and jewellery house to address the impact of the business on the natural world and marginalised communities. We also congratulate Oris on becoming a climate-neutral company, certified by ClimatePartner, a leading independent climate action expert."
"The company not only makes products that are sustainable, but also calculates the impact of its entire business, right down to workers commuting to the office. It earned climate-neutral status by offsetting more than 2,500 tonnes of CO2 through its sustainability initiatives. We will have a little more to say about this elsewhere in this section, but we wanted to single out Oris here as a way to show how other brands might also be doing the same, yet not communicating it directly enough."
"This may lead some to draw links with the fashion industry, which recently received a tongue-lashing from firebrand climate-change activist Greta Thunberg. Bear in mind, the fashion industry actually makes raw data available to a variety of authorities to confirm that their supply chains are not contaminated by any evil practices. Even so — or perhaps because of this — it gets a lot of flak. "
"Some may see a certain degree of adjacency in the worlds of watchmaking and fashion [Editor’s note: on LUXUO, watches used to fall under the Style category], with the world’s largest luxury conglomerate LVMH running iconic names such as Louis Vuitton and TAG Heuer. Of course, it also runs Moet Chandon and Glenmorangie and no one suggests any adjacency there."
"For our part, it seems clear that all industries will have to see that they are not causing harm, at the very least, so some standards might apply across the board. Setting such standards is a challenge, of course, and poses all kinds of political risks. "
"This was on show at the World Economic Forum this year, as global business leaders cited climate action failure as a major risk for the economy, and one with the best chance of being mitigated by a coordinated global response. The key point here is that risk, which is not acting in a harmful manner, but in merely failing to prevent harm."
"Accountants everywhere are now working to integrate this particular risk into their formulas, especially with regards to multinationals. One relevant example here was called the Responsible Business Initiative, which was rejected by Swiss voters last November, but this is not the end of that story. "
"Fast fashion certainly receives the lion’s share of the wrath of climate activists, and it probably deserves it, if news reports are anything to go on [Editor’s note: too many to cite]. Any so-called luxury brands using child labour for any reason ought to be tarred and feathered (and probably fined into oblivion). So far, there has not even been a whiff of scandal in watchmaking, but this might come down to the subject that preoccupies us in this issue: transparency. But we are racing ahead of ourselves again, and risking getting tripped up by our own feet."
"Backing up again to our opening assertion, by too early to discuss, we mean to say that there are many industries that have to grapple with their impact on the planet – tier one players, if you will – and watchmaking firms (especially those with a mechanical focus) are nowhere near that level."
"We take the view that it is pointless to tear into watch firms when coal-fired power plants are still merrily burning away like there is no tomorrow. Actually, more are being built to meet tomorrow’s demands, according to The Economist, the Financial Times and many more mainstream sources."
"There is some understanding within the trade of this obvious fact, with executives still claiming that mechanical watches are sustainable products, because they are not disposable. This is not a false statement, of course, but it does tend to lead to some unearned praise. H. Moser & Cie made quite a memorable joke about this some years ago with a statement watch, but we will hear more from the brand directly and candidly on the subject of sustainability later in our conversation with CEO Edouard Meylan. "
"To refer back to our earlier praise of Oris, CEO Rolf Studer put it most succinctly in a comment related to the climate neutral news, as delivered to WatchPro: “A mechanical watch has a very low impact on the environment because it’s designed to last. But that’s not enough,” he says. The first part of Studer’s statement is echoed by many watch industry executives, high and low. The second part, not so much, with a number of executives concerned about trade secrets and competitive advantages. "
"Cartier CEO Cyrille Vigneron addressed this directly with us as he explained the brand’s drive towards greater transparency in its entire operations. “The transparency I am talking about has nothing to do with trade secrets. It is about the raw materials that go into our products, and our supply chain.”"
"He publicly explained during Watches & Wonders earlier this year that the brand was deeply concerned about the world, and the impact of its business on the same. Vigneron noted that brands could not just say they were sustainable, they had to prove it. Richemont, the parent group of Cartier, has been talking the talk, and walking the walk for perhaps longer than any other group, which is why its brands rank highest in the WWF report."
"To frame this admittedly long narrative, we must add an expected caveat. If you love watches but are concerned about the environmental impact of current industrial practices, then you must turn to vintage watches. Aside from the obvious (you are extending the lifespan of a watch), you also do not have to trouble yourself with any thoughts about how the contemporary company making watches with the same badge conducts itself."
"This is important because it is often impossible to be sure watchmaking firms are doing all the right things if you do not want to take their word for it. This brings us back to sustainability, and that law that will go before Swiss legislators in place of the aforementioned Responsible Business Initiative. "
"The sustainability conversation in watchmaking tends to coalesce around the unfortunate subject of transparency. Well, transparency is the most significant roadblock, and is thus the most well-known and persistent problem. It goes back to the debate over Swiss Made standards, and to third-party movement suppliers working surreptitiously for a few major brands."
"It all sounds very suspicious, like some sort of Tom Clancy novel, but really it is all quite pedestrian. Like the business of making hairsprings, there really is not much to shout about here but to prove that we would need to supply evidence.. which is lacking. As you will have guessed, the Swiss watchmaking trade tends to be opaque by tradition. "
"This is where Swiss legislators hold the reins as they consider a law next year that will force even private companies to make certain non-financial disclosures. These include the following, according to Deloitte:"
"Reportedly, this legislation cannot be shrugged off by even private and family-owned firms because every Swiss firm will be called to order, as long as they meet the following criteria:"
"500 full-time positions or CHF 20 million balance sheet total and/or CHF 40 million in sales (source: Deloittes). The New York Times reports that affected companies will have to “ensure the traceability of their supply chains, and make their reports publicly available for 10 years…” We need not spell out exactly which companies will be taking notice here."
"As watch enthusiasts, collectors, traders and even hobbyists, we know that these will include the biggest and most powerful names in watchmaking. As mentioned, watchmaking firms are not specifically targeted, and are certainly far from being tier one players, which we repeat for clarity. "
"That being said, climate change rhetoric is heating up, thus lighting a fire under the feet of watch industry executives. In 2018, the WWF report called out a startling number of brands for their alleged lack of transparency in a widely cited public document."
"You can easily find these stories — and the report itself — online by searching for sustainability in watchmaking, but despite the attention, the topical subject remains largely difficult to discuss. The expert sources we found for this special section mostly pointed to one chief area: the supply chain, specifically where and how watchmakers get their raw materials. "
"To outline the problem more succinctly, consider all the metal that gets used to make wristwatches, cases, movements, bracelets and all. Most of the world might be shocked to learn that the average watch in stainless steel already uses a significant percentage (up to 50 per cent) of recycled iron."
"This varies from material to material, with titanium and aluminium on the higher end of the scale, while ceramic hugs the bottom at zero percent. This is because of material properties and engineering challenges, not some sort of conspiracy, to be clear. Indeed, the ceramic used in your typical higher-end watch might very well be eternal — well everlasting and evernew as a sapphire anyway. "
"For the purposes of transparency, we will acknowledge a few points before moving on. First and foremost is that this magazine urges better transparency for Swiss watchmaking, in general. Having said that, dear readers, you may detect sour notes of cynicism throughout this section, but what you are sensing is our pessimism."
"Pessimism is a little more honest than cynicism, and we hope to blunt this by making a few active recommendations. Transparency is the most important thing, for the same reason we asked CEOs how their manufactures were coping with the pandemic. Watches are fun, and they are meant to be."
"Something that is fun should not be hurting anyone, at the very least. No one should be suffering so that we can have fine timepieces, in other words. This article alludes to this point, but it should be made explicit. This, we think, is the most basic position we can take. Indeed, this should be the starting position for any firm that makes watches. "
"Secondly, we should be wary of arbitrary standards. One such example is illustrated by the Panerai Submersible eLab-ID, which would be currently the most sustainable watch in the world, if it were a full production model, which it is not. In any case, Panerai had found a way to make this watch out of 98.6% material."
"To be more precise, that is the percentage of recycled material in the watch, by weight. So, the obvious question is why not go the extra mile? “To get that last 1.4%, we would have to use so much energy that it wouldn’t be saving anything…Our idea isn’t to do something at an idotic level, just to say we did it,” Panerai COO Jerome Cavadini told us. In other words, the cost of doing something positive for the world should not result in a negative for the environment. That would be idiotic, and yet it may well be the result of reductionist thinking. Sustainability is a complex matter that will not be solved by overly simplistic approaches."
"On that note, we have to move to the unknowns, which is the most vexing aspect of sustainability. For example, are Richemont brands so highly regarded by the WWF report because they are better communicators than some independents? While we do try to present each major group’s position on sustainability elsewhere in this section, often there is no news to report."
"Even the very positive Oris news does not mean it will rank highly in the next edition of the WWF report, assuming the brand is included, which it was not in 2018. How you feel about the Oris achievement depends on what you think of ClimatePartner, an organisation you may never have heard of.  We have a compromise solution to suggest, which we will get to in the second part of this section."

"Watches are somewhat of a paradox. One the one hand – incredibly sustainable as a product which lasts generations with intermittent intervention (the definition of luxury). On the other, the manufacturing process, packaging and profit maximisation is often damaging. For too long watch brands have got away without having to improve their practices, and now customers, particularly younger ones, are starting to hold them accountable for their disruptive supply chains and global impact."
"The most obvious way brands are upping their eco game is via the materials they use. That’s been the case in straps for a while, which are a pretty surface-level way of ensuring a modicum of sustainability. It also happens that there are some pretty cool examples out there – good for the planet, good on the wrist."
Breitling ECONYL® NATO Strap
"Breitling’s Outerknown ECONYL® yarn NATO strap collection, for example, was launched in 2019. Created in partnership with Outerknown (a super-cool surf brand), the straps have been designed specifically for the Superocean collection."
"ECONYL® yarn is created exclusively from recycled nylon waste, some of which is recovered from discarded or lost fishing nets. The straps are not only recycled but are also completely recyclable and visually a powerful modern tribute to the surf culture of the 1950s and 1960s."
"Similarly, the Patravi ScubaTec Black, a new sporty number from Carl F. Bucherer, features its all-new black rubber strap with material made of 100% recycled plastic bottles removed from the ocean (it also looks mega). It ties in nicely with the brand’s ongoing work with the Manta Trust, helping to conserve rays and their habitats."
Christopher ward’s #tide ocean material® project
"However, more recently brands have been going a bit further in their quests to clean up the world and have begun including recycled materials into their watches proper. Sure, there have been concepts in the past doing just that but now we’re looking at a raft of new production pieces like Panerai’s eSteel. So let’s have a look at 10 of the most exciting watches championing sustainable materials."
""
"Panerai’s commitment to the development of sustainable materials is manyfold. For the Submersible eLab-ID they completely altered their supply chain to create an EcoTitanium. However, while titanium is no stranger to watchmaking, a more common material is steel and so finding an eco-friendly way to produce steel watches is a more pressing concern. The result of their experiments is eSteel, a steel alloy that uses a high proportion of recycled material and that, crucially, has identical physical and chemical attributes to the non-recycled alloy."
"All of which is to say that the Panerai Luminor Marina eSteel is almost identical to every other Marina, down to its 300m water resistance, except that it’s better for the environment. And it comes in three cool colours to boot. Sure, it’s about £1,000 more expensive than the base model but that’s a lower price to pay than risking the planet."

"The first really new watch on this list is the Christopher Ward #tide. The 42mm diameter watch was created in collaboration with the #tide ocean material company, who supply multiple manufacturers with plastic removed from the world’s oceans. Plastic supplied by them has been injected in the watch’s caseback and crown as well as being used to create the #tide strap, which is available separately across the entire Christopher Ward range."
"This watch is part of the C60 Trident line and has a captivating wave patterned dial. Although you won’t see much of the real waves above your head if you take it all the way down to its water resistance limit of 600m. It’s powered by the Sellita SW200, a chronometer status automatic movement with a slightly underwhelming 38-hour power reserve. However, at a price of £895 with a portion of sales from every #tide strap going to the Blue Marine Foundation, it’s a watch worth considering."

"Modern, contemporary materials lend themselves to bold modern designs and in diving watch terms that means big cases. Alpina’s Seastrong Gyre measures 44mm in diameter and is constructed from a mixture of 70% recycled plastic and 30% glass fibre, paired with a large stainless steel unidirectional rotating bezel with dive timer. Not to mention that the gorgeous black and electric blue colour combo is great to look at, so much so that the Gyre earned a place on our Ultimate Dive Watch Guide."
"An important thing to note is that while many sustainably built watches are still in the conceptual phase or produced as limited editions, the Seastrong Gyre is here to stay and is testament to Alpina’s commitment to ridding the oceans of waste fishing net, which is their plastic of choice."

"Turning away from the water, Baume have chosen to a very unique source to find a sustainable, upcycled material: the world of skateboarding. Skateboards are constructed out of multiple materials, which includes aluminium and wood, both of which are valuable resources that need to be protected. They also happen to be great materials for watchmaking, possessing the qualities of lightness, strength and flexibility."
"Baume’s attention to detail is exceptional as even the skate deck grip tape is used, giving the dial that classic skateboard texture and aesthetic. This is not so much a watch that set out to be sustainable as one where they realised a perfectly good resource was going to waste whenever a board headed to the trash pile. It also has the endorsement of Aurelien Giraud, a French pro skater who reached the street skating final at Tokyo 2020."

"It’s honestly amazing how much waste humans generate and not all of it as small as a plastic bottle tossed carelessly into the ocean, some of it can be as large as an entire boat left to rot on the coast. It’s these larger scale reclamation projects that The Sacred Crafts is involved with, turning disused boats into luxury, sustainable watches. For example, the bronze case of La Grande Mer, a 44mm diving watch, is made from reclaimed boat propellers."
"Another key material used by The Sacred Crafts is plastic taken from fish netting, which they use as an alternative to precious stones like jade. It’s not just about redistributing the physical material in an environmentally sound way, it’s also about re-evaluating the value we place on those materials. It’s this combination of factors that gives the brand it’s mission statement, Culture Reclaimed. It also doesn’t hurt that La Grande Mer has an attractive nautical aesthetic."

"The ‘sustainable’ part of the watchmaking industry sees a higher than usual proportion of concept watches because they allow watchmakers to experiment with new materials and new manufacturing techniques without having to commit to large scale production. While we may never see a watch akin to the concept again, the learnings are sure to go forward."
"The concept Ulysse Nardin Diver NET was an attempt to make each aspect of a watch as environmentally friendly as possible and its nautical leanings are no surprise given UN’s history. The 44mm case is constructed from recycled fishing nets and the strap is made from PET plastic taken from the oceans, provided by the same supplier as Christopher Ward’s C60 #tide. Intriguingly, they have also replaced the traditional sapphire crystal for a transparent ceramic because the overall energy used in its production is lower."

"In the environment conversation, oceans are without a doubt a major issue, but the other equally large issue is vehicles, especially cars. While they’re active they produce unrivalled amounts of pollutants and once they’re no longer usable, they often find their ways to vast scrap heaps that spoil the natural landscape. REC offer disused vehicles an alternative and more environmentally friendly ending, reclaiming their parts for use in unique and technical watches."
"Every watch they produce has components taken from an iconic car, each with the individual patinas they earned through use, making every watch produced unique. Their latest project is a collaboration with Gunther Werks on two timepieces, the 901 GW Exoskeleton and Chelsea, based on the Porsche 903. Both watches use recycled carbon fibre for their six-part construction cases and have redesigned sandwich dials. Naturally, because each watch model is made from a single vehicle, all REC watches are limited editions."

"One downside of sustainable watches has typically been their prices, due to the added effort in producing them they are often more expensive than their base model counter parts. However, earlier this year Swatch launched their new bioceramic material, a substance created from the combination of recycled plastic and ceramic powder that is simultaneously sustainable and accessible."
"The latest additions to their bioceramic watches are a summery collection of Gent and New Gent watches in black and white with vibrantly coloured open work movements. And at £70 for the white models and £79 for the black, they’re entirely accessible for anyone and help to show that sustainable doesn’t have to mean expensive. The trade off is that it houses a fairly standard quartz movement when, with an open work dial, you’d really prefer an automatic calibre."

"Similar to the Baume Skate, William Wood’s Triumph is sustainable in that it uses material that was being otherwise unused, which adds to the style and aesthetic of the piece. And in the case of William Wood, that material is vintage firefighting equipment such as disused helmets and hosing. The limited edition Chivalrous models feature brass commemorative plaques from repurposed helmets from the 1920s. However, the recent Triumph is a more well rounded timepiece."
The Triumph introduces a chronograph function to the collection for the first time and is adorned with cool retro style subdials. It’s a characterful design that shows that watches made from upcycled materials don’t have to be limited to modern aesthetics but can actually run the full gamut of watchmaking.

"As you’ve seen, there are now a fair few watches with cases made from recycled materials, which makes sense as far as practicality goes. The dial though, the main visual impact of the watch might be a stretch too far. Except for Oris, of course. The latest (and non-limited) version of their flagship diving watch uses a dial made from recycled ocean plastic."
"The Oris Aquis Date Upcycle is… out there. It’s similar in vein to the crazy TAG Heuer Monaco pieces made by Bamford Watch Department and Black Badger in those kind of eye-wrenching colours. But here it’s a touch more random and, strange given the fact that it’s ocean plastic, oddly organic. Otherwise the base watch is the same as ever, with a pared-back grey diving bezel and the usual 41.5mm case with 300m water resistance."
"It’s not for everyone, but it’s as funky as it is sustainable. If you can pull it off."

"As an alternative to these sustainably manufactured watches, there’s what brands have been doing for decades: watches for good causes. Honestly, these are often as much a marketing ploy as a genuine charity drive, but if they raise money for the right causes, who can argue? They often bring attention to eco charities that otherwise fly (or more often, swim) under the radar."
"Keep an eye out over the coming weeks for an in depth look at project’s like Ulysse Nardin’s work with OCEARCH and the FIU Medina Aquarius Program with the DIVER Lemon Shark, Hublot’s drive to save the rhinos with the skeleton-dialled Big Ban Unico SORAI and pretty much everything Blancpain do that’s not a heritage limited edition via their Ocean Commitment programme."

"Sustainable development is struggling to find its place in the watch industry. Clearly regarded as a low priority, it tends to make headway only in times of prosperity and is relegated to the back burner during periods of crisis. The major groups remain the driving forces, regularly keeping one step ahead of consumers, who have as yet shown little signs of demand in this respect."
"Watchmaking is inherently sustainable in that it produces exclusively durable products: such is the convenient explanation the industry has long relied upon to avoid debate on a field where it is significantly lagging behind. Unfortunately, the fact is that watchmaking emits pollutants, lays off staff and has its fair share of inequalities – no more and no less than any other industry."
"Nonetheless, Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) has managed to establish itself – first of all within the more distant brand-related environment, among consumers (waste sorting, domestic energy consumption reduction, hybrid cars), subsequently among industrialists (FSC wood, fair trading labels) and more recently among politicians who are now holding summits and multi-party debates at a frantic pace. Slowly but surely, the watch industry has been hopping on the bandwagon…"
"Tentative first steps
The initial tokens of ‘progress’ were not particularly encouraging, as the industry did what it does best: storytelling. One company began making its own honey, while another equipped its car park with three electric charging stations – but without the corresponding vehicles on the other hand. The illusion was not even remotely convincing and the SER report became a “green absolution” exercise in which the big groups displayed impressive skills. Unfortunately, facts and deeds are all that matter in this domain and it was a very long time before tangible signs of SER awareness began to emerge, many of them the aftermath of the 2008 crisis."
"Since then, we are pleased to report that things are indeed moving ahead, albeit at a fairly sedate speed. The latest example has been set by the new eco-friendly manufacturing site of A. Lange & Söhne inaugurated on September 5th of this year. The building reflects both sustainable architecture and innovative energy management. Its geothermal energy plant, the largest in Saxony, maintains a stable temperature year-round, and the building is an entirely CO2-free facility."
"Future-ready buildings
Without going quite that far, recent constructions or renovations in the industry generally strive to earn the Minergie environment-friendly level, as seen at Fleurier Ebauches or Jaeger-LeCoultre – whose latest 9,000 sq.m. extension (the largest in its history) has earned that particular certification. Over the past 20 years, improvements to its heating system have enabled it to maintain stable fuel consumption despite a 40% increase in the surface area of its production facility. Similar endeavours are being made by Swatch Group, which cut its fossil fuel consumption by 6.7%, despite a substantial rise in production – although production of special waste excluding batteries skyrocketed by +27.6%."
"Meanwhile, a number of companies have adopted measures such as installing photovoltaic panels on older constructions, including Audemars Piguet in Le Brassus, and TAG Heuer which now features 750 square meters of solar panels on its La Chaux-de-Fonds site."
"Coveted labels
Another area being developed is that of certifications. Minergie is a purely architectural one, as is the SIA 380/1 standard (issued by the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects) on which the new Hublot building is based, even exceeding its demands by 20% in terms of efficiency."
"Another recognised label in this field is that of the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), a not-for-profit organisation that aims to involve all stakeholders in the jewellery supply chain from mine to retail in establishing a code of practice governing the profession. Cartier has for example been one of the 14 founder members since 2005, and yet it did not itself earn certification until 2010. That gives an idea of the slow progress being made by the cause, even though the vast majority of firms have since adopted it."
"The future of sustainable watchmaking is probably best represented by Fairmined certification, guaranteeing the ethical nature of gold and its full traceability. Chopard blazed this particular trail with watch and jewellery collections representing a daring wager, given that this gold is definitely more expensive in that it must be processed via an entirely independent circuit within the Manufacture."
"Despite these higher costs, Chopard introduced a first series of 25 Fairmined watches in 2014. It was so successful that the subsequent series introduced in 2015 was ten times larger (250 watches). Marc Hayek has stated that the Swatch Group is also ready to consider this option and Harry Winston might examine the possibility."
"What about the human factor?
However one looks at SER, the letter S in ‘Social and Environmental Responsibility’ really means human beings."
"General equality of job opportunities has never been the real issue in the watch industry, given the many jobs historically held by women. Access to decision-making positions is however more problematic, as confirmed the extremely limited numbers of women sitting on company Boards – with the only well-known examples being Nayla Hayek and Jasmine Audemars, who is now 74. Among the independent brands, DeLaneau has Jessica Walther as its CEO, but there are really very few women at the helm of such firms."
"Independents display impressive ingenuity
The independent brands naturally do not have the means available to the big groups and thus rely on their ingenuity, as exemplified at Christophe Claret: “We have an ingenious system for our production building and our machines, which are cooled down by the typically cold nights of our region. It operates using water only, and we also took an innovative and risky choice ten years ago: to acquire a high-precision laser-cutting machine that saves 68 hours per day on the energy consumption of our machines, since it can do in just four hours what others take 72 hours to accomplish.”"
"Nonetheless, one cannot help observing that sustainable development is still not a priority for most of them. “The basic goal is to survive”, admits one of them with a sigh. While that is understandable enough, if consumers do make it their priority, they will be forced to keep pace."

"There are signs that the industry is changing, and top brands are leading the charge with innovative designs"
"The watch on the desk in front of me is huge, weird and fascinating: a chunky grey box as thick as two packs of playing cards and almost twice as wide. On display in its acrylic window are toy-like hands coloured bright red, blue and yellow on top of what looks like the scrambled insides of an electrical junction box: thick wires, memory slots, a circuit board. It’s so big, fit only for Hulk wrists, because it’s a giant prototype. This is the Garbage Watch, telling tomorrow’s time with trash."
"Twin brothers and former advertising creatives Nick and Steve Tidball run Vollebak, a radical design-led company that makes “clothes from the future” from emerging materials, new technologies and leftfield inspirations. They’ve created a jacket that’s 65 per cent copper, trousers designed to last 100 years and a sweater made from non-degradable redundant firefighting equipment and old bulletproof vests. In 2020, the design magazine Wallpaper* challenged them to “make things that aren’t loved, loved.” So Nick went looking in the rubbish."
"“I thought, you must be able to build a watch out of e-waste,” he says, referring to the plastic, metal, precious metals, ceramics and more sent to landfill every year as by-products of our voracious need for new devices. In 2019, 54 tonnes of it was generated globally, with only £3bn of the £10.5bn worth of precious metals within recovered. “The e-waste industry is forever growing because e-waste itself is forever growing,” he says, “so why go mining for copper in the earth when you can re-mine it from the surface, eventually at less cost?"
"“One of my favourite statistics is that if you could get all the gold in the world together, you still wouldn’t have enough to build a [solid] Statue of Liberty. Yet 7 per cent of all gold is in e-waste, in a dump somewhere. So why not go and get it?”"
"The result of his explorations is due for launch in 2022: the Garbage Watch, a timepiece that proudly wears its origins in recycled components. There’s no two way about it: it looks odd, with a Blade Runner-meets-Glastonbury-Block9 aesthetic. But the Tidball brothers idolise Steve Jobs, Heston Blumenthal and other design-led mavericks, and want their watch (like their clothes) to tell a story. “We were attracted to this aesthetic of the Pompidou Centre,” says Nick. “The inside on the outside. This object should celebrate visually where it comes from.”"
"The watch isn’t just a design statement, either. The Tidballs have been working with Acorn, the Silicon Valley imagineering company whose founder and CEO worked for Steve Jobs in developing the NeXT computer in the late 1980s. Together they think they’ve hit upon a third way to keep time, beyond mechanical winding or quartz, by generating a steady temporal heartbeat using systems of multiple coiled wires similar to those used by quadcopters and robots. “We think we might be able to do something that hasn’t been done yet,” says Steve."
"But why do it at all? The Garbage Watch is bold, bright, strange and certainly not for the haute horophile’s wrist. Because they’re not going for Watch Guy, they’re going for Future Guy. “Can we use all the e-waste in the world? Of course not,” Nick admits. “But if we can get some influential people to start wearing this, we’ve started a conversation."
"“Today, someone might be amazed that your watch is made of recycled metal and e-waste. The point is to get to a place where everyone has a watch made that way.”"
"How sustainable is your watch? Do you know where the metal came from? The diamonds? The gold? Do you know its carbon footprint? That luxury, leather-lined presentation case that’s sitting in a cupboard somewhere: do you know where that came from?"
"Some might say that the luxury watch – a meticulous assembly of exquisitely rare materials, often from the most inaccessible places on Earth, with a price tag to match – is the opposite of sustainable. A damning report from the WWF in 2018 declared that many of the biggest high-end watchmakers were either “unable to demonstrate where their raw materials come from, or that they are unwilling to communicate on the matter.” Plus, brand identities often built around international travel, flight, motorsport and other carbon-hungry avenues of conspicuous consumption hardly look good next to news stories of burning forests and flooded towns."
"Yet there are signs that industry is changing, as much from customer pressure from below as an understanding at the top that a reputation for sustainability will confer commercial advantage. Top brands, including Omega, Cartier and IWC Schaffhausen, have now signed the Responsible Jewellery Council code of conduct for accessing precious metals and gemstones. All of Chopard’s gold has come from ethical sources since 2018; Chopard and Rolex run their own gold foundries in order to recycle. Across the industry, sustainability reports, ethical business officers and recycled packaging abound. Yet the question remains: can a chunk of gold, steel, precious stones and leather on your wrist ever be neutral, much less beneficial, towards the state of the planet?"
"Oris, the small Swiss independent founded in 1903, has a long association with water conservation through its much-loved Aquis diving watches. It has released limited editions to raise money to protect the Great Barrier Reef, Russia’s Lake Baikal – the world’s deepest freshwater lake – and the River Han in South Korea. Recently the brand has pivoted to concentrate on ocean plastic, not just symbolically with names and iconography, but in the physical properties of the watch."
"“We discovered the alarming statistic that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish,” says Oris CEO Rolf Studer. “We see our mission as bringing change for the better and it was a clear signal that we had to take action.” First was a partnership with Everwave, formerly Pacific Garbage Screening, and its prototype floating platform that captures plastic from the oceans; then ocean-recovered PET used to make both the caseback on the Aquis Clean Ocean and the remarkable, mottled presentation box for the Ocean Trilogy set of three limited edition diver’s watches."
"A new release puts ocean plastic even more front and centre. The dial of the new Aquis Date Upcycle is made from recycled PET plastic, which creates random colour patterns such that no two watches are the same. The effect is unique and beautiful, resembling some exotic turtleshell or polished mineral rather than discarded water bottles or supermarket bags. Could recycled plastic become a fashion item? “Everyone that purchases one will have a completely unique watch,” says Studer. (And we know how watch lovers love exclusivity.)"
"“In the past, sustainability was seen as adding value to a watch,” says Studer, “but I think that will change from just a consideration into something that watch buyers expect. Watchmakers have to respond to that expectation.” Oris became climate neutral in 2021, in their Hölstein factory, their watches and boutiques globally. “For us, being sustainable is not just an opinion. It’s becoming essential to our existence.”"
"While Oris is working with plastic, others are changing the metal. In April 2021, Panerai, the Swiss-Italian dons of big watches, announced the Submersible eLAB-ID, a concept watch made from 98.6 per cent recycled materials, which, it says, is “the watch with the highest percentage of recycled-based material ever made.” Delivering on that would prove a challenge."
"“Panerai is known as a pioneer in materials and innovation, and our heritage is in the sea, so doing something for the planet is important to us, it fits,” says director of product development, Alessandro Ficarelli. “But the watch industry is conservative in terms of materials. So we had to look outside.”"
"Panerai’s engineers in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, Ficarelli explains, are on permanent lookout for new materials and technologies from other industries. In France they found EcoTitanium, an aviation-grade metal made using recycled offcuts and scraps of titanium from the aerospace industry, which has a drastically reduced carbon footprint.
“But we need very small components and they’re used to working with tonnes.”"
"In addition to the precision machining, which Panerai undertook itself, was the need for allergy tests – “you want to use new materials because of the storytelling, the colours, the meaning, but it has to work on the wrist too,” he says – and the minutiae of the movement, also made from EcoTitanium with an oscillating weight in recycled gold. Instead of sapphire and rubies, the jewels themselves are recycled sapphire."
"'People don't want a second bad conscience on top of the one they have from being rich' – Georges Kern, Breitling"
"“The supplier’s first answer was, ‘No, it’s impossible,’” says Ficarelli, “but they did it”. The hands, meanwhile, are recycled white gold and there is recycled silicon in the escapement and recycled steel in the movement. Even the Super-Luminova, the branded non-radioactive lume now standard on high-end watches, was painstakingly recovered from defective dials rejected earlier in watchmaking supply chains. “The goal was not to have recycled Super-Luminova just for fun,” Ficarelli says, “but to have it the exact same high quality as virgin material, with the same clarity and visibility in and out of the water.”"
"At £51,400 with only 30 pieces made, the eLAB-ID sits at the high and least accessible end of Panerai’s collection, but the more scalable aspects of its manufacture will find their way into the core line and watches like the Luminor Marina eSteel, now in 95 per cent recycled steel and at a more affordable £7,600. “With the eLAB-ID we wanted to create news in the watch industry,” says Ficarelli. “We wanted to say something symbolic about the circular economy. But 30 watches is a drop in the ocean and the development costs were huge. Our goal is that 30 per cent of the overall collection will be in recycled material. We want recycled steel and EcoTitanium to become the new standard.” Intriguingly, he says that as Panerai discovers more ways to increase the sustainability of its watches, it will not keep the details to itself but share them with the rest of the industry. “We want to be the first,” he says. “But we don’t want to be the only one.”"
"Yet for all these initiatives and symbolic moves, it’s still a confusing world for the conscientious watch-buyer. Your latest purchase might support good causes or offer strong provenance in certain materials, but where do all the other parts come from? How do you know what you’re really buying?"
"Breitling, Swiss maker of luxury chronographs and pilots’ watches, which recently pivoted to a younger demographic under the stewardship of larger-than-life CEO Georges Kern, thinks it has the solution: using a blockchain, the self-updating public database that tags and follows whatever is entered upon it, to record a watch’s materials and components. Every Breitling watch now has a “digital passport” and the goal is that, in time, a QR code can be scanned to see when, where and how every component was made. No more greenwashing , no more feints. The power will be in the customer’s hands."
"“In the next 5-15 years, customers will want total transparency on the production process and supply chain of what they buy,” says Georges Kern. “I really believe that this will be imposed legally sooner or later, so we have to be ahead of the curve.” Full traceability doesn’t just enable customers to make more informed choices, he says. It will enable Breitling to control its own activities, persuade suppliers to do the same and get to overall carbon neutrality. “And then you can go further and say, ‘OK, Can we offset all the CO2 we’ve produced historically?’ With blockchain, you can do this.”"
"Breitling has already made more conventional eco-friendly moves, ditching wasteful packaging in favour of innovative watch boxes made entirely from recycled plastic bottles and switching from paper to digital documentation. Last year, it released the Superocean Heritage ’57 Outerknown, a spin on its classic 1960s watch, featuring Econyl straps made from recovered ocean plastic, in collaboration with surfer Kelly Slater."
"“We’re not going to save the oceans with Econyl straps,” says Kern, “but it’s about education, it’s about reaching out to our 200,000 customers a year. They have a leverage, they’re wealthy, influential people and through their leverage, I think we contribute to improving the state of the world.” Kern has made major changes at Breitling since the company was acquired by CVC in 2017. Out went a perceived stuffy focus on heritage aviation and in came the now-famous “squads” of explorers, triathletes and celebrities, including Charlize Theron, Brad Pitt and Adam Driver. Unsurprisingly, this reorientation of Breitling towards sustainability is not purely altruistic."
"“The luxury industry is changing,” Kern says. “People want sustainable behaviour from brands. They don’t want a second, bad conscience on top of the one they have from being rich.” Plus, he says, potential investors make similar demands. “You cannot sell or buy a company if you don’t have a proper ESG [environmental, social and governance] policy in place. Business is far ahead of what politicians are requesting on this.”"
"The look and feel of Breitling has changed as a result. “Some luxury behaviours are just anachronistic,” he says. “Do you want to be seen driving a yellow supercar in Milan when we have an ecological crisis? Maybe you’d prefer to be in Hawaii with our Surfer Squad, cleaning beaches instead.” Such thinking contributed to the end of Breitling’s long-standing sponsorship of the Jet Team stunt planes in 2019."
"'We want to make statement symbols, not status symbols' – Ludvig Scheja, Triwa"
"What does he say to people who argue that watchmaking is inherently not sustainable? That these are luxury items dependent on precious metals, which can never truly be environmentally friendly? “What is really not sustainable are digital watches,” he counters. “The batteries, the plastic, the disposability. You don’t throw away a mechanical watch. You keep it for life. These are pieces of art. How many people are wearing their fathers’ timepiece? There’s nothing more sustainable than an analogue watch.”"
"Some materials have a moral debt as well as a carbon footprint. In the mid-2010s the Swedish watch micro-brand Triwa – a contraction of Transforming the Industry of Watches – experienced a mid-life crisis. “Our original plan was to market watches like caps or sneakers, not as unattainable luxury,” says creative director Ludvig Scheja, “but we reached a soul-searching moment when we said, ‘We went into this to make something new, but now we more or less look like every other watch brand’. This is what got us thinking about sustainability.”"
"It began working with Humanium Metal, a Swedish start-up that supplies recycled iron and steel from illegal firearms seized in conflict zones and invests profits in communities affected by gun violence. Humanium needed a product to prove their concept; Triwa were happy to provide. As with Panerai’s recycled titanium, the new production process generated challenges unheard of in conventional watchmaking. “Usually you stamp watch cases from sheets of stainless steel,” says Scheja, “but we had to use metal powder and an injection moulding process.”"
"The result was a range of automatics and chronographs with an austere, brushed-metal aesthetic, workhorse Citizen movements and a sub-£550 price tag. The watches are subtle, attractive and feel like they’re doing some good somewhere in the world. So far Triwa has given back about £110,000 to the Humanium company’s projects and participated in the destruction of 12,000 weapons. The former UN chief weapons inspector Hans Blix owns one of their watches."
"Above all, says Scheja, they’re not a gimmick. “We wanted to treat this metal with respect and highlight what it stands for,” he says. “Presenting a normal watch design in the usual way and then sending some money, it doesn’t work. I’ve been to El Salvador, seen people affected by gun violence, and I can see that [our work can] make a difference.” The brand is now expanding into watches made entirely from recycled PET plastic. “We want to make statement symbols,” says Scheja, “not status symbols.” Increasingly, Triwa is not alone."

Your guide to a disrupted world
Fiona Matthias
We’ll send you a myFT Daily Digest email rounding up the latest Watches news every morning.
"You might think that every mechanical watch, made in Switzerland or otherwise, is inherently sustainable – no built-in obsolescence, every part repairable. “You never actually own a Patek Philippe, you merely look after it for the next generation,” and all that. But what’s the cost (in sustainability terms) of the mining of gemstones and metals, the energy needed to produce glass, plastics and ceramics, the production of rubber or leather?"
"“Behind the polished face of a luxury watch, a potentially immense ecological footprint is hidden,” said the World Wildlife Fund only two years ago in a report on the Swiss watch business with its long and varied supply chain of metals and gemstones. "
"On the plus side, sustainability is now the primary driver of business innovation according to the Harvard Business Review. At the top end of the watch industry, brands including Cartier, LVMH, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Omega, Chopard and IWC Schaffhausen are now signed up to the Responsible Jewellery Council, whose certification looks at an ethical supply chain covering gold, silver, platinum group metals, diamonds and coloured gemstones. Since 2018, 100 per cent of Chopard’s gold has come from ethical sources and, like Rolex, it operates its own gold foundry so it can recycle. IWC Schaffhausen releases a sustainability report to the public every two years; and Richemont and LVMH both have policies that go far beyond legal mandate."
"But who is looking beyond the traditional watchmaking raw materials to create new, potentially reusable and recyclable products for the future? A good place to start is with those highlighting the need to clean up the oceans. They’ll never remove the eight million tonnes of plastic that leaches into our seas every year, but with innovation they are recycling some of that and raising awareness."
Recycled material can be equal to new material
"Tom Ford recently launched its Ocean Plastic Timepiece (£895). The plastic used in the making of the watch is “100 per cent ocean plastic” with “an average of 35 bottles of plastic waste used per product including watch and strap”. For every 1,000 watches sold, Tom Ford reduces plastic waste to the “equivalent of 35,000 water bottles or approximately 490lbs of plastic”. The raw material was collected in the oceans, along coastlines and from uncontrolled landfills."
"It’s important to consider the way the plastic has been recycled, too, which in Tom Ford’s case is a “100 per cent mechanical” process developed with the Swiss University of Applied Science that used only solar energy. Look out for Tide Ocean Material in association with other manufacturers. It’s the Swiss outfit behind the collection, upcycling and verifying of the plastics used by Tom Ford. “We give plastic waste a value” is the company’s mantra."
"Social justice is part of the Tide narrative, too: on five islands in the Andaman Sea, fishermen are being trained and paid to gather and sort plastic waste. A “just transition” for communities such as these adds to the sustainability balance sheet."
"Ulysse Nardin turned its attention to the marine circular economy some years ago. Its research unit studies oceanic materials such as oyster shells, algae, marine PET (polyethylene terephthalate or plastic bottles) and polyamide fishing nets. Earlier this year, it launched the R-Strap – its first to be made from fishing nets, created in support of swimmer and adventurer Ben Lecomte, who is routinely confronted by the devastating impact of plastic pollution in the oceans. These straps accompany the Diver, Marine Torpilleur and Freak X watches."
"Recently, however, Ulysse Nardin went one step further and revealed its Diver NET concept watch, which will come to market within two years. "
"The watchmaker teamed up with three young Brittany-based designers, the co-founders of Fil&Fab, who collect nets from fishermen that they sort by colour, shred and extrude into pellets. These become the raw material for the watch’s case, middle, back and bezel decoration. As Yann Louboutin of Fil&Fab says, they are proving that “recycled material is equal to raw material”."

"Standard sapphire crystal has been replaced by more energy-efficient transparent ceramic glass, and the thread used in the concept watch’s PET strap is created from waste plastic by Tide. And, unlike the Tom Ford watch that, for all its other virtues, is powered by a battery, it will have a mechanical movement."
"Breitling introduced its first strap made from recycled materials in 2018. The Nato strap in Econyl yarn, made from “regenerated nylon waste from landfills and oceans around the world”, now adorns the Superocean Heritage Chronograph 44 Ocean Conservancy limited edition (£4,880), the Superocean Heritage Chronograph 44 Outerknown (£5,600) and its latest, the Superocean Heritage ’57 Outerknown (from £3,400). “We try to do as much as possible within our sphere of influence,” says CEO Georges Kern, who recently launched a 100 per cent recycled and recyclable watch box, created from upcycled plastic bottles, for which it received a stamp of approval from the Solar Impulse Foundation for its innovation as an “Efficient Solution”."
"Recycling goes beyond plastics, however. Panerai, which has been associated with the Italian Navy and the oceans for more than 100 years, is in the early stages of its move to greater sustainability. “Our journey is a very recent one,” says Jean-Marc Pontroué, the brand’s CEO."
"Last year, Panerai launched the limited-edition Submersible Mike Horn with a case, bezel and caseback made of EcoTitanium (produced from scraps from aircraft manufacturers’ yards) and a recycled-plastic strap (£35,800). This year, the brand produced the skeleton Submersible EcoPangaea Tourbillon GMT. “This idea came from [explorer] Mike Horn,” explains Pontroué. “He came with a piece of metal from his boat Pangaea, saying: ‘Either I throw it away, or I’d love if you used this piece of metal to make watches.’ I was thinking he was crazy when he proposed that to me two years ago.” It’s now a reality. The manufacture has made just five limited-edition cases for its Mike Horn Submersible EcoPangaea. “Forty per cent of the value of this product is made with recycled components,” says Pontroué. The former driveshaft of the boat is now the base material for a £169,900 timepiece."
"From a recycled boat to recycled cars. REC Watches, launched in 2014 by the Danish “childhood buddies” Christian Felix Mygh and Jonathan Kampstrup, claims to “recover, recycle, reclaim”. The first challenge they set themselves was to salvage a Mini Cooper, recycling as much of the material as possible to create brand-new watches “honouring the original design”. They have since done the same with a Porsche 911, a Ford Mustang and a MK IX Spitfire."
"This year, the partnership has created the RNR (Road Not Required) limited editions crafted from a classic Land Rover. They are the company’s first Swiss-made mechanical pieces. The Beach Runner version (£1,370) is a limited edition of 552 pieces, made from the roof of a 1981 Land Rover Series III once owned by the Portuguese photographer and filmmaker Daniel Espírito Santo. The RNR Rockfighter (also £1,370) is limited to 463 pieces, with a dial handcrafted from the door of a 2003 Land Rover owned by off-roader Michael Ortner. The original vehicles were far from sustainable, but what they have morphed into is another matter."
"Where else does innovation lie? Swatch recently launched a 13-watch collection, the 1983 (from £58), using a bio-plastic derived from the castor plant; the packaging is made from a paper foam consisting of potato and tapioca starch that is fully biodegradable or, in Swatch language, “Bioreloaded”."
"The castor plant was first used to make a watch by Mondaine in 2017 for its “environmentally friendly” Essence watch (£189). After processing, oil extracted from castor plants can be used like an organic plastic. There’s a new collection out this year. Other renewables used in the Mondaine range include wool and cork, as well as packaging made from 100 per cent PET bottles. "
"These watches, like the Tom Ford piece, are battery-driven and there is a longer-term issue over the sustainability of large-scale castor farming. Whether bioplastics are always less polluting than oil-based plastics remains a moot point, but Swatch and Mondaine are at least asking the question."
"The Danish company Circular Clockworks, meanwhile, is producing “circular” watches – both in the literal and sustainable sense. Every watch (from €149) is designed for disassembly. The company not only uses recycled ABS (if you really need to know, it stands for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene – a thermoplastic polymer that is expensive when virgin) sourced from TVs, coffee makers and construction helmets, but also recycles leather scraps or offcuts from the shoe industry for straps. The straps are bound by natural latex and have no metal fixings, which means they are fully biodegradable. “Every watch has the potential to be used as a base for new watches,” say the founders Tom Gudde and Ceriel Lucker, who not only facilitate repairs but will buy back any watch rather than let it reach the point where it lies discarded at the back of a kitchen drawer."
"And finally, there’s Vollebak’s Garbage Watch, which could be just the thing. It claims to be “built from the tech the world threw away in the trash”. It looks like a miniature Pompidou Centre on the wrist. The waiting list is now open for the 2021 launch. "
