"The news: Amazon and Apple are advancing their sustainability goals, with the former investing in eco-conscious startups and the latter transitioning its suppliers to sustainable energy."
"More on this: Amazon’s and Apple’s announcements come ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which starts next week. Both companies have made ambitious commitments to sustainability and renewable energy in recent years as the climate crisis looms large over regulators and consumers."
"Consumers driving change: Much of the increased investment in sustainability follows changing consumer attitudes toward the environment. On the whole, consumers are concerned about ethical spending and how the brands they interact with affect the environment."
"It’s here: the 2022 Retail Personalization Index. This is the industry’s largest study on the modern marketing and personalization capabilities of today’s top 100 retail and ecommerce leaders. Explore the Index to learn how brands like Thrive Market, Sephora, DSW, and more are reshaping the retail experience."
"Why it’s worth watching: Combine consumer interest, regulator scrutiny, and growing global anxiety toward climate change, and you have an environment with a wide array of industry leaders racing to outperform their rivals in sustainability, either through investments and supply changes, or through branding products with sustainability in mind."

Apple makes a big deal about its efforts to be environmentally friendly. But how environmentally friendly is Apple really?
"While announcing the iPhone 13, Apple made a point to highlight the positive environmental practices behind the latest smartphone, such as reduced packaging and recycled materials. Apple has made a habit of highlighting these environmental practices with new releases, but how environmentally friendly is Apple really?"
And how does the iPhone 13 fit into Apple's history of environmental practices?
"In the past, Apple has been heavily criticized for its forced obsolescence of various devices. By making it impossible for older devices to update their operating systems (OS), owners of older Apple devices, like the iPhone 6, end up upgrading to new ones."
"In fact, many users report upgrading to a new iPhone when their old one can no longer run the latest versions of iOS, even if it can still be of use otherwise. This is mainly due to the fact that after some time, many users report apps necessary for their daily life stop working without the latest version of iOS, which they can't install."
"In addition, unlike Microsoft actively exploring right to repair frameworks, Apple has consistently lobbied against the right to repair movement in the United States. The right to repair movement refers to the legislation that would require tech companies to provide practical ways for third-party repair of their devices through parts, tools, or diagnostic methods."
"According to YouGov, 53% of mobile phone users do not get their devices repaired because of the high repair costs. In line with this, most owners of broken iPhones only have two options—pay for monthly AppleCare subscriptions or exorbitant fees in authorized repair centers. Often, users report for it to be significantly more cost-effective to simply purchase a new iPhone instead of paying for repair options."
"Since 2018, Apple's global operations, such as stores, offices, and data centers, have run on 100% renewable energy. After hitting this milestone, Apple made another commitment to make its supply chain and products 100% carbon-neutral by 2030."
"To achieve this, Apple created a 10-year roadmap with the goal of lowering carbon emissions. This roadmap includes overhauling product designs to make use of recycled materials, becoming more energy-efficient, implementing process improvements, practicing carbon removal, and more."
"In its 2021 Environmental Progress Report, Apple reveals several significant moves it has already made towards its goal of net-zero climate impact by 2030. Split into three main parts, the report talks about its various efforts in climate change, resources, and innovative technology."
"As part of its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, Apple established an Impact Accelerator. With a focus on investing in minority-owned businesses, the accelerator not only improves its supply chain, but also helps support communities which are most at risk from environmental hazards."
"With its 100% renewable energy-sourced facilities, Apple also partnered with over a hundred suppliers who have made the commitment to doing the same. In fact, some of the most of significant changes can be observed with the launch of the iPhone 13 models."
"Designed to reduce its environmental impact, the iPhone 13 range features several changes to its manufacturing. Using several technological innovations, Apple has found ways to improve its recycling facilities so that it can better recover key materials."
"RELATED:
Apple Customers Recycle More Devices Than Buyers Of Other Brands"
"Similar to the magnets used in MagSafe, Apple manufactures the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max with 100% recycled rare earth elements. Aside from this, the solder in its main logic board and battery management unit consists of 100% recycled tin. Lastly, Apple uses 100% recycled gold for its logic board plating and cameras."
"Not to mention, Apple's redesigned packaging for the iPhone 13 models are also the first iPhones to eliminate the outer plastic wrap. In line with its 2025 goal of completely removing plastic from all its packaging, this change prevents 600 metric tons of plastic from entering landfills and oceans."
"While on paper it can appear that Apple has already made a considerable effort in terms of environmental sustainability, it's not without its share of shortcomings."
"For example, Apple's removal of the power adapter and earphones was undoubtedly effective in terms of reducing its net carbon emissions from packaging size and shipment. However, the newest models have charging cables that are incompatible with the adapters older iPhone users are likely to own."
"Because of this, many iPhone users tend to purchase additional charging bricks, with their own packaging. Alternatively, iPhone owners also purchase from more accessible third-party brands with less environmentally-friendly processes."
"RELATED:
Apple Highlights Environmental Benefits Of Not Selling IPhones With Power Adapters"
"Aside from this, there's also the question of distribution. While Apple can increase the number of iPhones in a truck because of its reduced packaging size, it doesn't necessarily mean that all stores will be able to maximize this. With varying demand, it's possible that the effects of changing the packaging size will not be as significant in the grand scheme of things."
"In addition, Apple still has not changed its tune when it comes to its repair policies. So, while Apple has revved up its various trade-in programs, it is still actively encouraging iPhone owners to buy new phones, which is always arguably worse for the environment than fixing old ones."
"Over the last 11 years, Apple claims to have reduced its average energy requirement per product by 73%. If successful with its latest initiatives, Apple will be an interesting case study for a framework in environmental sustainability for similar companies."
"While Apple is not without its fair share of remaining environmental issues, the most recent addition to its iPhone lineup shows its commitment to making changes that benefit the environment but don't significantly hamper its profitability. At the end of the day, the majority of the environmental cost of owning an iPhone is outside a consumer's control. For this reason, it's not fair to blame iPhone users for most of the environmental toll associated with its ownership."
"However, it's still possible to do our part by taking care of our Apple devices so that they remain usable for as long as possible. Hopefully, with time, Apple will provide more options to keep using the iPhones we already own, instead of having to buy a new one too soon."

"The latest news and updates, direct from Apple."

By Richard Conn
"Apple is not only the world’s most recognizable brand but also the most valuable, with an estimated value in 2020 of $205.5 billion. "
"The main contributors to that value are its iPhone range and its Macs, with laptop sales recently regaining market leadership. "
Apple is now going green with a goal of becoming 100% carbon neutral by 2030. 
We look at six sustainability initiatives that are helping them reach that target.
Lowering the Use of Carbon Materials
"Since its introduction in 2007, the iPhone has sold over 1.5 billion units. Their phones also play a major part in the world of e-commerce marketing. "
"But with demand for products growing, how do you find balance? One approach is to increase the amount of both low carbon and recycled materials in products, be innovative in  recycling old products, and make design more energy-efficient. "
"One innovation is “Dave”, a recycling robot designed to recover rarer materials such as earth magnets and tungsten from old phones, as well as a percentage of the steel used. "
Apple also has a specialist Material Recovery Lab located in Texas and has partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to research new recycling solutions. 
"Sales channel strategies that incorporate environmental policies will have more appeal to the modern, climate-conscious consumer. "
Renewable energy
Making the move to renewable energy is the cornerstone of Apple’s green policies.  
"Apple’s new headquarters opened in California in 2017 and is 100% powered by solar panels. The company also planted 9,000 new trees on the site.  "
"In 43 countries, all of its stores, offices, and data centers are entirely powered by renewable energy. This is contributing to a positive effect on pollution both globally and at a local level.  "
Apple extends this to its supply chain. More than 70 suppliers have committed to using 100% renewable energy. This will be equal to taking over three million cars off the roads. 
"Apple has always been at the forefront of industry innovations, such as being able to send fax from computer. Now they are applying innovation in green policies into their business model. "
"With many consumers increasingly caring about eco-centric issues, this can play a big part in the psychology of closing sales. "
Innovations in materials
"Most people see innovations in terms of features in their iPhones, Macs, and other solutions, such as a cloud phone system. "
But Apple is currently working closely with two of its aluminum suppliers to develop the first carbon-free aluminum smelting process. They have developed extremely low carbon aluminum that is being used for parts and components in the 16-inch MacBook Pro.
"Another problem is fluorinated gases, which contributes to global warming. Through working  with partners, Apple reduced use of these gases by more than 242,000 metric tons in 2019."
"Green credentials can extend to software too. If the company producing software tools – for example, time management tools – have solid environmental policies, then this can help with overall sales. "
China
China is a major part of Apple’s manufacturing chain. An estimated 30% of all iPhone 6 orders are built there. 
"But due to its coal-burning power plants, China faces major pollution issues. To help with this, Apple launched the China Clean Energy Fund and has invested just under $300 million toward developing clean energy there."
The fund aims to be able to produce around one gigawatt of clean renewable energy. It is hoped that all iPhones manufactured or assembled in China will be in plants powered by renewable energy by the end of 2020. 
Reducing the use of conflict materials
"Although ‘blood diamonds’ is a phrase most people recognize, fewer people are aware of the term “conflict minerals.” These usually come from areas of the world where there is some form of conflict and are obtained through the exploitative use of workers, with human trafficking and slavery often involved and the proceeds helping to prolong and fund the conflict. "
"The main three conflict minerals are tin, tungsten, and tantalum (the 3 Ts), but gold can also be included. A common source of these minerals is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), an area with ongoing violence and human rights violations."
"Apple has now ceased relationships with any mineral providers that fail Apple’s intensive auditing process. By working with suppliers and smelters that are certified as ethical and conflict-free, Apple hopes to reduce the demand from areas such as the DRC.  "
External Work
The company realizes that this is a global issue and so have extended their efforts outside the Apple family. Some of their initiatives include:
Environmental policies implemented by Apple could give you ideas for material to include for virtual team building with new channel partners. 
The takeaway
"Apple was long criticized for its negative environmental impact. In recent years, however, it has made a huge amount of progress. "
"If it applies the same effort to these subjects as it does to providing conference calling provider solutions, then it will no doubt continue to hit its targets. "
"As companies look to solutions such as call-center tracking as part of their digital tool kits, solutions providers who have green credentials will have an advantage.  "
Its 2019 Environmental Responsibility Report showed that the company had reduced its carbon footprint by a massive 35% over the previous three years. Apple even received a special award in 2019. 
"With ambitious goals in place, and programs to tackle environmental issues both within the company and on the global stage, Apple is setting an example for other corporations to follow. "
"Richard Conn is the senior director, Search Marketing for RingCentral, a global leader in unified communications and call center service provider."
"He is passionate about connecting businesses and customers and has experience working with Fortune 500 companies such as Google, Experian, Target, Nordstrom, Kayak, Hilton, and Kia. Richard has written for sites such as Clicdata and Marketscale."

"Although ‘blood diamonds’ is a phrase most people recognize, fewer people are aware of the term “conflict minerals.” These usually come from areas of the world where there is some form of conflict and are obtained through the exploitative use of workers, with human trafficking and slavery often involved and the proceeds helping to prolong and fund the conflict. "
"The main three conflict minerals are tin, tungsten, and tantalum (the 3 Ts), but gold can also be included. A common source of these minerals is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), an area with ongoing violence and human rights violations."
"Apple has now ceased relationships with any mineral providers that fail Apple’s intensive auditing process. By working with suppliers and smelters that are certified as ethical and conflict-free, Apple hopes to reduce the demand from areas such as the DRC.  "
External Work
The company realizes that this is a global issue and so have extended their efforts outside the Apple family. Some of their initiatives include:
Environmental policies implemented by Apple could give you ideas for material to include for virtual team building with new channel partners. 
The takeaway
"Apple was long criticized for its negative environmental impact. In recent years, however, it has made a huge amount of progress. "
"If it applies the same effort to these subjects as it does to providing conference calling provider solutions, then it will no doubt continue to hit its targets. "
"As companies look to solutions such as call-center tracking as part of their digital tool kits, solutions providers who have green credentials will have an advantage.  "
Its 2019 Environmental Responsibility Report showed that the company had reduced its carbon footprint by a massive 35% over the previous three years. Apple even received a special award in 2019. 
"With ambitious goals in place, and programs to tackle environmental issues both within the company and on the global stage, Apple is setting an example for other corporations to follow. "
"Richard Conn is the senior director, Search Marketing for RingCentral, a global leader in unified communications and call center service provider."
"He is passionate about connecting businesses and customers and has experience working with Fortune 500 companies such as Google, Experian, Target, Nordstrom, Kayak, Hilton, and Kia. Richard has written for sites such as Clicdata and Marketscale."

"With consumers increasingly conscious about the environment, many big tech companies are finding that going plastic-free and carbon-neutral is good business strategy."
Apple (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc. Report CEO Tim Cook reiterated the company's goal to remove all plastic in its packaging by 2025 and go entirely carbon-neutral by 2030 in his company's most recent earnings call on Oct. 28.
"""As our customers are seeing when they purchase iPhone 13, we've redesigned the packaging to eliminate the outer plastic wrap, which will allow us to avoid using 600 metric tons of plastic,"" Cook said. ""[...]We've also made good progress toward our goal to one day make our products without taking anything from the Earth."""
"The move to eliminate plastic, mirrored by companies like McDonald's (MCD) - Get McDonald's Corporation Report and American Airlines (AAL) - Get American Airlines Group, Inc. Report, comes at a time when consumers are increasingly asking questions about the environmental impact of products they buy. "
A recent consumer study by Mastercard ( (MA) - Get Mastercard Incorporated Class A Report) found that 62% of people polled believe it's important for large companies to be sustainable and eco-friendly while 54% are trying to reduce their own carbon footprint since the breakout COVID-19 pandemic.

Leaning into that trend could have a meaningful impact for companies including Apple.
"With Americans expected to spend a record $487 billion on new phones in 2021, tech companies play a large role in both real-world and consumer perception of whether something is being done for the environment."
Another survey by environmental technology company GreenPrint found that 64% percent of Americans are willing to pay more for products that are environmentally friendly but 74% aren't always sure how to identify such products.
"Making a product that is sustainable can help win over consumers specifically looking for that and score an edge over the competition. Steps such as increasing its carbon-neutral suppliers and using more recycled materials, which Apple also said it was doing in the same earnings call, can keep the company top of mind as environmentally forward and, in doing so, bring in more sales."
It's also a pretty big edge to be Apple (or any large company doing this) because it's easier to raise consumer awareness. Cook sharing Apple's environmental pledges simply gets more media attention than when a smaller company tries to do the same or even bases its business around sustainability. 
"""We're very encouraged to see the growth in this area and we will continue to drive those changes in the supply chain in the months and years to come,"" Cook said. ""We've never viewed our environmental work as a side project."""

"Apple today announced that it has joined Sustainable Semiconductor Technologies and Systems (SSTS), a new research program launched by Belgium-based R&D organization Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (Imec), to reduce the environmental impact of “choices made at chip technology’s definition phase.” According to a press release, SSTS will use models and greenhouse gas footprint analyses to help the integrated circuit-making (IC) industry cut back on its ecological footprint as part of the global fight against climate change, resources depletion, and pollution."
"IC technology enables everything from internet of things devices, machine learning, and cloud computing to cars, washing machines, and smartphones. Unfortunately, the world’s growing dependence on semiconductors and their production processes have expanded the IC-making industry’s ecological footprint. Research has shown that close to 75% of a mobile device’s carbon dioxide emissions, for example, can be attributed to its fabrication, with almost half of that resulting from the underlying IC manufacturing."
""
""
""
"SSTS, with Apple as its first member, will aim to inform partners of the environmental impact of certain early-stage choices, drawing on Imec’s research on infrastructure and machinery. Imec, which was founded in 1984 as a nonprofit organization, has its roots in a 1982 Flemish government program set up to strengthen the microelectronics industry in Flanders. The organization now employs a team of 5,000 and conducts R&D in semiconductor and system scaling, silicon photonics, AI, wireless communications, and sensing technologies."
Apple has separately committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.
"“Many systems companies are carbon neutral today for their corporate footprints and have expressed the ambition to have their entire carbon footprint to net zero by 2030. They are very committed to achieving that goal, yet often lack the data to decipher the IC part end-to-end. That is where imec comes in,” Imec CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement. “We have those data, and are ready to support the industry with all necessary insights, tools, instruments, and numbers. Moreover, companies realize they can only become carbon neutral if their whole supply chain follows suit. So, that is the snowball effect we want to create — together with Apple — today. I would like to call upon the whole semiconductor value chain not to stand at the side, but to act as one and to join forces with us to cut back the entire semiconductor industry’s ecological footprint.”"
"A recent paper by Harvard researchers showed that information and computing technology could account for as much as 20% of global energy demand by 2030, with chip manufacturing responsible for the bulk of that footprint. In 2019, Intel’s chip fabrication plants used more than three times as much water as Ford plants and created more than twice as much hazardous waste. Meanwhile, Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC’s annual electricity consumption is projected to rise to 7.2% of Taiwan’s entire usage within the next few years."
"TSMC — which is a key Apple supplier — has pledged to use 100% renewable energy by 2050. South Korean semiconductor supplier SK Hynix recently announced a collaboration with Apple to develop “environmentally friendly” memory for future iPhones. And Intel says it currently treats and returns some 80% of the water it uses, with the goal of raising that to 100%."
"But the insatiable demand for chips threatens to undercut those sustainability efforts. TSMC said last year that it plans to spend $100 billion expanding its fabrication capacity; Samsung is committing $116 billion over a decade on its foundry business; and Intel plans to spend $20 billion building additional facilities in Arizona. Elsewhere, the European Union has proposed legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030."

"Apple continues to strive for a 100 percent closed-loop supply chain, encourages others to produce mindfully, and strives to solidify the company as a pinnacle of environmentally-forward thinking."
"In 2016, Apple joined a global initiative called RE100, in which they sought to shift entirely to renewable energy. In the spring of 2018, Apple announced that their data centers, retail stores, and the Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino all ran on 100 percent renewable energy."
"There's no doubt that Apple is trying to take sustainability seriously, but when you're producing up to one billion iPhones annually — to say nothing of iPads, MacBooks, or AirPods — you're bound to do some significant damage. In fact, nearly all of the environmental detriment that Apple causes is in manufacturing, with a distant second place going to distribution."
"In fact, in 2012, Apple sent just over 4.8 million pounds of waste to landfills. By 2015, that number rose to over 13 million pounds. In 2018, Apple had sent 36.5 million pounds — or 18,250 tons — of waste to landfills."
"What's a company like Apple to do? After all, if one is to be realistic, Apple isn't going to produce less devices. That doesn't mean that they don't have some ideas, though."
"In 2017, Apple had announced plans to create a fully closed-loop supply chain. This would mean that eventually, all Apple products would be made with 100 percent recycled materials."
"It's not so far fetched, as Apple has already produced 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures for the MacBook and the Mac mini."
"Recycled materials often require less processing than raw materials, meaning that they're often significantly less damaging to the environment. Recycled materials also don't require mining, which itself is responsible for erosion, soil and water contamination, and a host of other problems."
"An ambitious goal for sure, and one made without fully knowing how it would be done. ""We're thinking about literally every single part of what we are making It's the mother of all objectives,"" Cook said in an interview with GQ. ""But it's one that we love to set."""
"Of course, in order to make a product from 100% recycled materials, you'll have to harvest the materials from somewhere. Apple has begun using recycled rare earth from an unnamed outside supplier for use in the iPhone 11's Taptic Engine. Lisa Jackson, Apple's Vice President of environment, policy, and social initiative, has stated that Apple is looking into how it can recover rare earth from its own products."
"The act of harvesting the materials is also crucial. Liam, a robot introduced in 2016, was capable of disassembling iPhones into core components. These components could then be used in new products, such as cutting tools or solar panels."
"Daisy, Liam's successor, debuted on Earth Day 2018. Daisy is capable of dismantling 200 iPhones an hour, and at the time of introduction, could disassemble nine versions of the iPhone."
"This year, Apple has pushed for consumers to trade in old iPhones when purchasing a new one. Cook states that upwards of a third or more of those coming into the Apple Store to purchase a new phone were trading in an old one. It's an attractive option for customers to get credit toward a new device, and it provides Apple with a steady stream of iPhones to disassemble and — hopefully in the future — recycle for new in-house products."
"Ultimately, Apple will continue to set lofty goals for itself in terms of sustainability, though both Lisa Jackson and Tim Cook have stated Apple has a duty to encourage other companies to follow suit."
"Cook suggests that there's a chance that Apple will be able to exert some influence over third-party Apple accessories. Providing a special badge or certification for mindfully produced goods, alongside deciding what gets sold in official Apple stores, could urge more companies to follow a more sustainable route."
"""We carefully decide what goes in our store,"" Cook said to GQ. ""That's sort of how we would put the finger on that scale to try to motivate people to do the right thing. In a case where there's something that is required from us, like for use of our mark and the case of the [Lightning] connector, yes, that is something we're talking about."""
"""We feel like we hopefully are part of making a whole generation of people in the manufacturing space see clean energy as something that's very much attainable and doable,"" Jackson said in an interview with Fast Company."
"This is especially important when it comes to third-party companies that manufacture consumer electronics. Apple started the China Clean Energy Fund, alongside 10 suppliers in China, with hopes of supplying one gigawatt of renewable energy to Apple's suppliers."
"Many of its suppliers have decided to power their Apple operations with renewables — 44 suppliers across 16 companies. Some of the suppliers have decided to switch to renewable energy for all of their work, which includes products made for other brands."
"The chance to influence other companies is one that is not lost on Cook, either."
"""We think that we fail if we only do it ourselves,"" he said, speaking of urging other companies to follow Apple's path. ""We do it because we want to leave the place a bit better than we found it, and not just what is left when we get finished with it."""
""
"Hope they continue to design and build these take-apart machines. iPads and Macs should be next. Fairly easy for Apple as all of their machines are metal, glass, logic board plastic/composite, rubber/silicone wire wraps and batteries. Their use of plastic is relatively minimal. "
""

"“... but when you're producing up to one billion iPhones annually...”

As I shareholder, I wish Apple produced 1 Billion iPhones annually!! In 2018, it was more like 218 million iPhones. "
