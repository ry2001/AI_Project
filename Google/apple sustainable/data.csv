"The news: Amazon and Apple are advancing their sustainability goals, with the former investing in eco-conscious startups and the latter transitioning its suppliers to sustainable energy."
"More on this: Amazon’s and Apple’s announcements come ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which starts next week. Both companies have made ambitious commitments to sustainability and renewable energy in recent years as the climate crisis looms large over regulators and consumers."
"Consumers driving change: Much of the increased investment in sustainability follows changing consumer attitudes toward the environment. On the whole, consumers are concerned about ethical spending and how the brands they interact with affect the environment."
"Perception: Advertising on the open web is doomed — False! With hundreds of campaigns in markets around the world, Lotame’s Panorama Identity Solutions are proving that advertising on the open web is sustainable, profitable, and privacy safe. See the results for yourself! "
"Why it’s worth watching: Combine consumer interest, regulator scrutiny, and growing global anxiety toward climate change, and you have an environment with a wide array of industry leaders racing to outperform their rivals in sustainability, either through investments and supply changes, or through branding products with sustainability in mind."

"The majority of people in the developed world are familiar with Apple’s products. Whether it’s phones, tablets, computers or watches, they have a product available with their infamous logo on it. If you look at their marketing materials or watch any of their announcement events, you’ll see that they make quite a big deal about their environmental commitments. In this post, I’m going to look into these commitments in more detail to find out if Apple actually is environmentally friendly."
"One of the biggest environmental costs of technological products is, of course, the manufacturing of it. There are many different metals, rare earth materials and plastics used in each one. These come from areas all around the world. According to Apple’s 2021 environmental progress report, one of Apple’s main goals is to only use recycled and renewable materials in their products. This is a rather big goal that would be hugely beneficial for the environment. Unfortunately right now they are not close to achieving this. Currently, 12% of the materials they used are recycled. On the plus side, the recently released MacBook Air does use 40% recycled materials. Their use of recycled materials does seem to be increasing each year. According to the report, part of the problem is that they are being constrained by limited availability of recycled cobalt, glass, lithium and a material called tantalum. It’s clear that more development is required in general e-waste recycling in order for them to achieve this goal."
"If we compare this to one of their biggest competitors in the smartphone industry, Samsung, we can see noticeable differences. Samsung has made their own commitments to increasing the use of recycled plastics in their phones as well as using more recycled paper. This is a step in the right direction but there seems to be very little action on other recycled materials. Considering a large percentage of the environmental costs of manufacturing are related to the metals and other rare materials, it’s important for companies to be looking at these areas more closely. It seems clear that Apple is leading the way in this regard."
"Whilst the main problem with these kinds of products is the manufacturing of the products, the packaging it ships in as well as the transport of the product are also potential concerns. Apple’s goal is to eliminate plastics in their packaging entirely by 2025 in addition to only using recycled materials. They’ve been making good progress on this one. Since 2015, the percentage of plastic used in their packaging has fallen from 21% to 6% in 2020. The percentage of recycled fibers used is currently 59% which is a good start. The remaining amount also comes from responsibly sourced forests."
"Regarding transportation, they state that they are making an active effort to use more low-carbon transportation methods such as rail when possible. In some areas such as Europe, they try to work with carbon-neutral carriers for delivery (such as companies which deliver on bikes). There doesn’t seem to be any concrete information on this so it is hard to verify. Considering that most of their products are assembled in Asia, which are usually transported via plane, they are likely not environmentally friendly in their transport. They have, however, made progress by reducing the size of their packaging. For example, the iPhone 12 box was made significantly smaller which allowed them to ship 70% more phones in the same pallet. This will have a big impact on the carbon emissions for each individual product."
"When you finally have the product in your hands, the environmental cost of using it begins. According to Apple, 19% of the device’s overall carbon footprint comes from actually using it. The main cost is the electricity use of powering and recharging the device. The environmental cost of this depends on where you are charging it and the electricity grid of your country. Apple does not have control over this. What they do have control over is how much energy the device needs to operate. According to their environmental report, the average energy usage of their products has decreased by 70% since 2008. Their new Mac processor, the M1 chip, has also led to substantial reductions in energy usage. This is great to see but there is more work to be done."
"Apple has faced criticism for how difficult it is to repair their products. Through their use of proprietary screws, glues and tools, it can be very difficult for someone to repair their own phone. However, in most cases, an Apple technician is able to repair phones without needing a full replacement. Whilst I don’t necessarily agree with Apple’s approach to repairability, this doesn’t seem to be a major environmental concern if it is possible to get them repaired. Of course, this could lead to it being more expensive to repair your device. Some have stated concerns about Apple taking several components and them combining them into one chip. When one part of this chip fails, the whole chip needs to be replaced. This is a valid concern. However, it’s important to factor in that this chip is usually smaller and therefore needs less materials to be produced in the first place. If the chip is reliable, then there is likely no significant impact on the environment."
"When you’re done using the product for whatever reason, what happens to it is a big factor in the overall environmental cost. If it ends up in general trash, this is a huge waste of the materials in the product. To Apple’s advantage, there is a big market for second-hand Apple devices. Apple has their own refurbishment program where they fix up old iPhones so that they can be used for years to come. iPhones can be passed on to several owners and used for 5 – 10 years. This obviously helps the environment."
"In an ideal world all of the materials in products that have reached the end of the line would be separated and recycled to make future devices. This is an area which has yet to be fully solved and is not specific to Apple. Right now the recycling of e-waste is very poor. It is very expensive for recycling companies to have the tools needed to disassemble so many different types of electronics. In a lot of cases, e-waste is sent to developing countries in Asia where unsafe practices are used to try to extract materials which may be releasing toxic fumes into the air in these countries and putting employees at risk. A lot of the e-waste doesn’t end up getting recycled at all. One of Apple’s solutions to this is their own recycling robot called Daisy. This robot can disassemble iPhones much more efficiently than regular e-waste recycling. It is unclear how many iPhones are going through this system compared to general waste and e-waste recycling facilities though."
"If you’re wondering if Apple is environmentally friendly, I think we can conclude that they are putting in a lot of effort in a lot of areas. Ranging from them using 100% renewable energy in all of their facilities to goals for being completely carbon neutral by 2030, it’s clear that they’re working hard on this; so compared to most of their competitors in the smartphone, tablet and computer industries, they are definitely the environmentally friendly choice. However, the most environmentally friendly device is the one you already have, something you can read more about in our general post about the manufacturing of smartphones."
"There is an argument to be made that a company that is trying to sell you a new phone every year could not be environmentally friendly in principle. The manufacture, use and recycling of these devices are tough on the environment, something which is made worse if they are being replaced on a regular basis. If they released a new device every 3 years instead of every year, this would be better for the environment than what they are currently doing."
"They are, of course, a company responding to the demands of its customers who are constantly expecting the latest and greatest new thing. Given our modern society, it seems Apple is as environmentally friendly as we’re currently going to get."
"Apple’s commitment to protecting the environment is an integral part of its business practices. From the earliest stages of design through manufacturing, use, and recycling, Apple takes care to minimize the environmental impact of its activities."
"To support a clean and healthy environment for all, Apple actively takes steps to improve its product design, manufacturing, energy use, and recycling programs, including:"
Selecting environmentally acceptable materials and substances
Reducing waste from the manufacturing process
Providing software tools that enable users to control the energy-saving features of their systems
Providing product recycling programs for customers worldwide
"For a more comprehensive description of Apple’s environmental considerations and improvements, see the Apple Environment website."
"Already carbon neutral today for corporate emissions worldwide, the company plans to bring its entire carbon footprint to net zero 20 years sooner than IPCC targets"

By Richard Conn
"Apple is not only the world’s most recognizable brand but also the most valuable, with an estimated value in 2020 of $205.5 billion. "
"The main contributors to that value are its iPhone range and its Macs, with laptop sales recently regaining market leadership. "
Apple is now going green with a goal of becoming 100% carbon neutral by 2030. 
We look at six sustainability initiatives that are helping them reach that target.
Lowering the Use of Carbon Materials
"Since its introduction in 2007, the iPhone has sold over 1.5 billion units. Their phones also play a major part in the world of e-commerce marketing. "
"But with demand for products growing, how do you find balance? One approach is to increase the amount of both low carbon and recycled materials in products, be innovative in  recycling old products, and make design more energy-efficient. "
"One innovation is “Dave”, a recycling robot designed to recover rarer materials such as earth magnets and tungsten from old phones, as well as a percentage of the steel used. "
Apple also has a specialist Material Recovery Lab located in Texas and has partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to research new recycling solutions. 
"Sales channel strategies that incorporate environmental policies will have more appeal to the modern, climate-conscious consumer. "
Renewable energy
Making the move to renewable energy is the cornerstone of Apple’s green policies.  
"Apple’s new headquarters opened in California in 2017 and is 100% powered by solar panels. The company also planted 9,000 new trees on the site.  "
"In 43 countries, all of its stores, offices, and data centers are entirely powered by renewable energy. This is contributing to a positive effect on pollution both globally and at a local level.  "
Apple extends this to its supply chain. More than 70 suppliers have committed to using 100% renewable energy. This will be equal to taking over three million cars off the roads. 
"Apple has always been at the forefront of industry innovations, such as being able to send fax from computer. Now they are applying innovation in green policies into their business model. "
"With many consumers increasingly caring about eco-centric issues, this can play a big part in the psychology of closing sales. "
Innovations in materials
"Most people see innovations in terms of features in their iPhones, Macs, and other solutions, such as a cloud phone system. "
But Apple is currently working closely with two of its aluminum suppliers to develop the first carbon-free aluminum smelting process. They have developed extremely low carbon aluminum that is being used for parts and components in the 16-inch MacBook Pro.
"Another problem is fluorinated gases, which contributes to global warming. Through working  with partners, Apple reduced use of these gases by more than 242,000 metric tons in 2019."
"Green credentials can extend to software too. If the company producing software tools – for example, time management tools – have solid environmental policies, then this can help with overall sales. "
China
China is a major part of Apple’s manufacturing chain. An estimated 30% of all iPhone 6 orders are built there. 
"But due to its coal-burning power plants, China faces major pollution issues. To help with this, Apple launched the China Clean Energy Fund and has invested just under $300 million toward developing clean energy there."
The fund aims to be able to produce around one gigawatt of clean renewable energy. It is hoped that all iPhones manufactured or assembled in China will be in plants powered by renewable energy by the end of 2020. 
Reducing the use of conflict materials
"Although ‘blood diamonds’ is a phrase most people recognize, fewer people are aware of the term “conflict minerals.” These usually come from areas of the world where there is some form of conflict and are obtained through the exploitative use of workers, with human trafficking and slavery often involved and the proceeds helping to prolong and fund the conflict. "
"The main three conflict minerals are tin, tungsten, and tantalum (the 3 Ts), but gold can also be included. A common source of these minerals is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), an area with ongoing violence and human rights violations."
"Apple has now ceased relationships with any mineral providers that fail Apple’s intensive auditing process. By working with suppliers and smelters that are certified as ethical and conflict-free, Apple hopes to reduce the demand from areas such as the DRC.  "
External Work
The company realizes that this is a global issue and so have extended their efforts outside the Apple family. Some of their initiatives include:
Environmental policies implemented by Apple could give you ideas for material to include for virtual team building with new channel partners. 
The takeaway
"Apple was long criticized for its negative environmental impact. In recent years, however, it has made a huge amount of progress. "
"If it applies the same effort to these subjects as it does to providing conference calling provider solutions, then it will no doubt continue to hit its targets. "
"As companies look to solutions such as call-center tracking as part of their digital tool kits, solutions providers who have green credentials will have an advantage.  "
Its 2019 Environmental Responsibility Report showed that the company had reduced its carbon footprint by a massive 35% over the previous three years. Apple even received a special award in 2019. 
"With ambitious goals in place, and programs to tackle environmental issues both within the company and on the global stage, Apple is setting an example for other corporations to follow. "
"Richard Conn is the senior director, Search Marketing for RingCentral, a global leader in unified communications and call center service provider."
"He is passionate about connecting businesses and customers and has experience working with Fortune 500 companies such as Google, Experian, Target, Nordstrom, Kayak, Hilton, and Kia. Richard has written for sites such as Clicdata and Marketscale."

"If it applies the same effort to these subjects as it does to providing conference calling provider solutions, then it will no doubt continue to hit its targets. "
"As companies look to solutions such as call-center tracking as part of their digital tool kits, solutions providers who have green credentials will have an advantage.  "
Its 2019 Environmental Responsibility Report showed that the company had reduced its carbon footprint by a massive 35% over the previous three years. Apple even received a special award in 2019. 
"With ambitious goals in place, and programs to tackle environmental issues both within the company and on the global stage, Apple is setting an example for other corporations to follow. "
"Richard Conn is the senior director, Search Marketing for RingCentral, a global leader in unified communications and call center service provider."
"He is passionate about connecting businesses and customers and has experience working with Fortune 500 companies such as Google, Experian, Target, Nordstrom, Kayak, Hilton, and Kia. Richard has written for sites such as Clicdata and Marketscale."

"With consumers increasingly conscious about the environment, many big tech companies are finding that going plastic-free and carbon-neutral is good business strategy."
Apple (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc. Report CEO Tim Cook reiterated the company's goal to remove all plastic in its packaging by 2025 and go entirely carbon-neutral by 2030 in his company's most recent earnings call on Oct. 28.
"""As our customers are seeing when they purchase iPhone 13, we've redesigned the packaging to eliminate the outer plastic wrap, which will allow us to avoid using 600 metric tons of plastic,"" Cook said. ""[...]We've also made good progress toward our goal to one day make our products without taking anything from the Earth."""
"The move to eliminate plastic, mirrored by companies like McDonald's (MCD) - Get McDonald's Corporation Report and American Airlines (AAL) - Get American Airlines Group, Inc. Report, comes at a time when consumers are increasingly asking questions about the environmental impact of products they buy. "
A recent consumer study by Mastercard ( (MA) - Get Mastercard Incorporated Class A Report) found that 62% of people polled believe it's important for large companies to be sustainable and eco-friendly while 54% are trying to reduce their own carbon footprint since the breakout COVID-19 pandemic.
Leaning into that trend could have a meaningful impact for companies including Apple.
"With Americans expected to spend a record $487 billion on new phones in 2021, tech companies play a large role in both real-world and consumer perception of whether something is being done for the environment."
Another survey by environmental technology company GreenPrint found that 64% percent of Americans are willing to pay more for products that are environmentally friendly but 74% aren't always sure how to identify such products.
"Making a product that is sustainable can help win over consumers specifically looking for that and score an edge over the competition. Steps such as increasing its carbon-neutral suppliers and using more recycled materials, which Apple also said it was doing in the same earnings call, can keep the company top of mind as environmentally forward and, in doing so, bring in more sales."
It's also a pretty big edge to be Apple (or any large company doing this) because it's easier to raise consumer awareness. Cook sharing Apple's environmental pledges simply gets more media attention than when a smaller company tries to do the same or even bases its business around sustainability. 
"""We're very encouraged to see the growth in this area and we will continue to drive those changes in the supply chain in the months and years to come,"" Cook said. ""We've never viewed our environmental work as a side project."""

"Apple today announced that it has joined Sustainable Semiconductor Technologies and Systems (SSTS), a new research program launched by Belgium-based R&D organization Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (Imec), to reduce the environmental impact of “choices made at chip technology’s definition phase.” According to a press release, SSTS will use models and greenhouse gas footprint analyses to help the integrated circuit-making (IC) industry cut back on its ecological footprint as part of the global fight against climate change, resources depletion, and pollution."
"IC technology enables everything from internet of things devices, machine learning, and cloud computing to cars, washing machines, and smartphones. Unfortunately, the world’s growing dependence on semiconductors and their production processes have expanded the IC-making industry’s ecological footprint. Research has shown that close to 75% of a mobile device’s carbon dioxide emissions, for example, can be attributed to its fabrication, with almost half of that resulting from the underlying IC manufacturing."
"SSTS, with Apple as its first member, will aim to inform partners of the environmental impact of certain early-stage choices, drawing on Imec’s research on infrastructure and machinery. Imec, which was founded in 1984 as a nonprofit organization, has its roots in a 1982 Flemish government program set up to strengthen the microelectronics industry in Flanders. The organization now employs a team of 5,000 and conducts R&D in semiconductor and system scaling, silicon photonics, AI, wireless communications, and sensing technologies."
Apple has separately committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.
"“Many systems companies are carbon neutral today for their corporate footprints and have expressed the ambition to have their entire carbon footprint to net zero by 2030. They are very committed to achieving that goal, yet often lack the data to decipher the IC part end-to-end. That is where imec comes in,” Imec CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement. “We have those data, and are ready to support the industry with all necessary insights, tools, instruments, and numbers. Moreover, companies realize they can only become carbon neutral if their whole supply chain follows suit. So, that is the snowball effect we want to create — together with Apple — today. I would like to call upon the whole semiconductor value chain not to stand at the side, but to act as one and to join forces with us to cut back the entire semiconductor industry’s ecological footprint.”"
"A recent paper by Harvard researchers showed that information and computing technology could account for as much as 20% of global energy demand by 2030, with chip manufacturing responsible for the bulk of that footprint. In 2019, Intel’s chip fabrication plants used more than three times as much water as Ford plants and created more than twice as much hazardous waste. Meanwhile, Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC’s annual electricity consumption is projected to rise to 7.2% of Taiwan’s entire usage within the next few years."
"TSMC — which is a key Apple supplier — has pledged to use 100% renewable energy by 2050. South Korean semiconductor supplier SK Hynix recently announced a collaboration with Apple to develop “environmentally friendly” memory for future iPhones. And Intel says it currently treats and returns some 80% of the water it uses, with the goal of raising that to 100%."
"But the insatiable demand for chips threatens to undercut those sustainability efforts. TSMC said last year that it plans to spend $100 billion expanding its fabrication capacity; Samsung is committing $116 billion over a decade on its foundry business; and Intel plans to spend $20 billion building additional facilities in Arizona. Elsewhere, the European Union has proposed legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030."
