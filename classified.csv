1,i tried for all 14 merch items i got zero on my own my friend managed to get the mikrokosmos lamp for me my sister is very lucky she was able to get our la ptd concert tickets and i was not now she went to weverse at exactly 8pm our time and got the lamp right away i rarely win anything even random raffles and draws lol so i am pretty used to this but i am very happy my friend got the lamp for me ,others
2,i would have loved hobi is bag and joon is wind chime but the scarcity mentality of these drops really left a bad taste for me so i did not try for any of them i loved getting to see the behind the scenes and qvc vibe videos but it was not worth putting myself through the stress i consoled myself with buying sope merch from a small business who also recently had a launch ,others
3,tae is bag failed had no idea what i was doing i used global and did not know how to pay with paypal jimin is hoodie failed in retrospect this is my most desired one i wanted at least one wearable i logged into paypal beforehand but had to sign in again hobi is pots succeeded made sure i was signed in did two practice runs on paypal avoided double tapping and over refreshing idk if this does anything but repeated it with jk is mood lamp jk is mood lamp succeeded i just did the same exact thing as with the flowerpots i really thought i lost it because it took a while ,others
4,i tried for v is bag jimin is hoodie and jk is lamp i failed each time resulting with me getting angrier each time edit i am still salty about failing to get 1 hoping for restock edit 2 i am going to try again during the second preorder hopefully i will not be a and at least get something this time ,others
5,my merch actually came today and the packaging is absolutely lovely there is so much attention to detail the merchandise is sturdy high quality and worth the price it actually makes me more heartbroken and frustrated by the whole experience from the weeverse app not working to paypal being slow as molasses it makes me so sad the merch is gorgeous yall i sincerely hope there is a restock i want more people to have the experience of such beautiful items ,brightness
6,hi i made a survey for this let me grab the link lol edit please fill it out ,others
7,i got the bad day pajamas earrings and a pink hoodie i failed to get rm is wind chime and sweatpants wind chime went from coming soon to sold out so i could not even try sweatpants were out of stock after i got through paypal and j hope is bag again immediately went to sold out rm and j hope are my biases though so that is a bummer ,others
8,i did not even tried i am a pessimistic by nature but losing in this specific competition would have been the worst thing ever so yeah i decided i was not about to sink into it and just watch the bloodbath congratulations to everyone who got something you thanos colored mfs are the real deal on these purple streets ,color
9,i tried for tae is pins hobis pots jimin is hoodie and jk is jacket i got the the cloud pins from tae and pink jacket from jk ,color
10,i tried for everyone is after namjoons launch with my sister was most excited for jks mood lamp but did not get it however my little my brother got my sister and i jks pink hoodie thinking of trading the pink hoodie for a lamp if anyone is interested ,others
11,i did not try for anything but i would like rm is wind chime frankly my life is just too overwhelming right now for me to be able to remember i should log on at a certain time to try and buy a thing online and when i started seeing the difficulty and frustration other people were having i was fine with that i liked jks lamp but it was over the price i would want to pay ,others
12,i tried and failed for rm is sweatpants v is brooch set did not sign into paypal ahead of time and was successful in getting jk is pink hoodie just trying to let the elation of successfully purchasing outweigh the dollar68 usd shipping i wish i had tried for jimin is earrings but unfortunately i was not at home when the drop happened but i am really happy i got something ,color
13,i managed to get tae is faces set twice paypal had a glitch i guess and then my friend got me the flowers set i tried for jk is pink hoody but paypal took forever to process and i missed out but then my friend same one who got me flowers set was able to get the white hoody for me i tried to help someone secure hobi is bag but i failed ,color
14,i am a jungkook tae bias so i knew i wanted to try for theirs first and foremost taehyung is is the first one i tried to get cloud brooch set but i was unsuccessful at this point i saw how fast everything was selling so i figured it would not hurt to try for one item per member to hopefully get something i tried for jimin is hoody and j hope is bag next and was unsuccessful with both of those today i finally snagged jungkook is pink hoody i really wanted to get the lamp too and i actually wanted the black hoody but i figured both of these would sell out the fastest which is why i chose the pink hoody i am not sure if that worked in my favor but i am just happy to at least have one item and extra happy that it is my bias i loved this merch idea and the personalization of it so much but if they ever do it again i would hope for a lot of things to be done differently this was too stressful for me ,color
15,how in the heck did people get so much stuff i have to say i know thanks to my husband we have phenomenal wifi i personally tried all 7 drops and only got one set of tae is pins only tried for 1 item each time to maximize efficiency i have 4 family members who also tried for all 7 drops and only one of them also got v is pins and we got literally nothing else from the other 6 drops everyone getting multiple things astounds me i was right on the nose at 6 59 mst refreshing for these drops kudos to you all honestly i am impressed but like how ,others
16,i did not get anything except literally today with jk is hoodie have no allies to help with buying so it was a solo endeavor that felt like the movie 300 edit got one item out of 14,others
17,this is mine and my sister is collective efforts jin good day pajama rm chime and joggers v despair suga necklace jimin hoodie jhope 2 sms bags jk 2 hoodies v is her bias so she is absolutely devastated she did not get his bag ,others
18,tried for v is bag and cried when i did not get it lmao i got yoongi is black necklace then somehow got the bag when they did the random restock then got jk is mood lamp and one armyst sweater when they suddenly restocked a couple hours after the drop ,color
19,i tried for yoongi is necklace jimin is sweatshirt hobi is planters and jk is lamp and got nothing i was most excited for the necklace since i relate to him so much and was pretty bummed when i did not get it i mentioned this on the other thread but i thought these drops were so fun i get sad in january after the holidays and this was fun to look forward to even if i did not get anything ,others
20,i got 5 out of 7 the 2 i missed out were sugas necklace which was my top pick go figure and jimins sweater i am definitely not complaining but let me tell i blame my work wifi for the missus ,others
21,tried for 3 suga is necklace plus tae and hobi is bags got hobi is bag i got one item out of my bias line of five so i am feeling happy to have gotten at least one thing ,others
22,attempted 6 sales just got jk black hoodie ,color
23,i wanted to try to get rm is windchime jimin is earrings and v is boston bag but did not want to put myself through the stress ,others
24,saw everyone is feedback after jin is merch drop so i was scared to even try i wanted the wind chime and sweatpants buti only threw myself into the fray for jk is mustard hoodie but the app froze as i clicked on agree i think that is the part it goes to paypal anyhoo i should have been patient maybe it was not frozen and just processing either way i have got the sads i am 0 for 1 but i am hoping they release more p s i filled out the survey too,others
25,i tried for joon is wind chime jimin is hoodie tae is pins and kookie is black hoodie i got nothing damn you kakaopay i can not use that on the app and i live in california ,color

27,casually tried for joons joggers even managed to go from global to us after i saw the shipping and got them that was the only thing i managed to get after trying for at least one thing from every other member ,others
28,my friend and i tried for 5 7 we missed the first two we both tried to get 2 of an items during the releases she was unsuccessful each time i was able to get 2 jimin earrings and 2 mikrokosmos lamps this entire release was so stressful and now dates have been pushed back for usa shipping and i will not get these items till july so i will have awhile to wait to enjoy ,brightness
29,i was trying also with my daughter this is how we did windchime i failed she succeeded so we have 1 for me suga necklaces we both tried and succeeded and each got both colors i should say we each got 2 of one color so that we will each have 1 of each color never could have time to add both colors hobi bag i tried and succeeded jungkook mood lamp we both tried and failed and just saw there will be a second pre order so we will try for the mood lamp again i might try for some tae pins for my hobi bag ,others
30,i tried for the v is boston bag suga is cover set jim is earrings and hobi is mini bag 100percent unsuccessful on all of them i already had weverse open on the merch at least 10 minutes before the drop and refreshed right before the time changed i used the us store and was pre logged in to paypal i have it set up that paypal recognized my phone so i just had to confirm which card to use for the boston bag i never saw it go on sale just straight to sold out for the others coming back from the paypal site to weverse they switched to sold out ,others
31,i tried for all 7 and was successful with 3 the wind chime jimin is hoodie and suga is necklace ,others
32,jin is pj is is all i got tried for all others with no luck ,others
33,i tried for three and got none yoongi is necklace jimin is earrings hobi is bag i gave up and did not try for any of jks ,others
34,tbh i only tried for jimin is hoodie did not get and jk is mood lamp got it but i was highly considering rm is joggers at the time it was still relatively early in the merch releases so i was not sure if i really wanted it i think i would try for them if they happened to do an actual second preorder with announcements this time ,others
35,i tired for every one i failed each time super disappointed overall by this experience jimin is hoodie and rm is chime were the two saddest losses though the hoodie though my number one miss for sure ,others
36,i tried for rm is windchime hobi is bag and jk is lamp and got none of them i wanted many of the others too but did not think it was worth the price war zone to try to get them every single time i made it to paypal then got re directed back to weverse shop and told it was sold out ,others
37,i tried for yoongi is necklace hobi is items and jungkook is lamp but all failed i tried for jimin is and got both the earrings and hoody ,others
38,i tried for jimin is hoodie x2 one for me and another for my best friend and hobi is bag x2 same reason and got neither my best friend tried for suga is necklace jimin is hoodie x2 same reason and hobi is bag x2 and got the necklace and the bags  so by working together we both got what we wanted from the initial drop except for jimin is hoodie we will both be trying for the hoodies again tonight during the second preorder wave ,others
39,love sope would you please share a link ,others
40,congrats can i ask what you mean by overrefreshing ,brightness
41,ditto i really wanted yoongi is notebook but it was the dollar24 shipping that turned me away ,others
42,same for the pjs i wish i had tried backed out for the same reasons i would have liked the cloud pins too in retrospect ,others
43,good thing comes to those who do not give u up i am so happy for you ,others
44,very very lucky awesome ,brightness
45,wooooow  ,brightness
46,in hindsight you were the one who needed to talk me out of buying anything today or you transferred your good weverse karma to me and that is how it happened ,controller
47,this is so impressive though were you in the us or global shop and did you try different techniques for each drop would love some tips my so was 0 4 tries i was 2 4 but feel like it was just pure luck ,others
48,in the us very surprised i got anything after the wind chime ,others
49,how does it work tips please so i can be ready too ,others
50,so with my first two attempts i kept refreshing the product page until i saw buy now i think preemptively or if it was lagging i was impatiently refreshing i thought it was not working for my last attempts at 9 i would refresh once and just wait it would show buy now and i would tap everything moving forwards just once and wait even if it looked like it was not working i am not sure if that is common sense but i was impatient and unsure if the app was even working the first two rounds it was just very laggy ,others
51,they are from the us iirc,others
52,i liked the cloud pins too and i tried for them but i was too late the faces were still available at the time but i did not get them ,others
53,thank you  i will admit the desperation i felt when it came to jk is drop compared to the others was just on a whole different level lmao ,others
54,we failed on a few other attempts i also tried getting her v is bag and jungkook is lamp she is more of a bts fan than i am but i have a pin collection so the clouds fit well will try for the windchime and planters again tomorrow lol,others
55,i really do not know still perplexed but have also learnt not to ask questions anymore re weverse shipping ,others
56,no i am in the us and ordered the pjs from the global shop that was the quickest i ever got anything from the weverse shop lol the pjs are very nice quality and so cute sizing is a little on the smaller side because the medium fit me perfectly even the length and i am usually a small in us sizing ,brightness
57,yes absolutely everything was so nicely done and well thought out but i specifically meant the actual merch drop cause that is just an absolute hell ride ,brightness
58,it is so stressful and normally it is rough but not this rough most drops were like okay i can snag 2 3 things i really want and checkout asap but these were like pick a thing and run hope paypal does not screw you i have never been so anxious over something so frivolous ,others
59,also to add to u chikowita is shipping cost list i got joon is trackpants and the shipping was dollar103usd however i checked my 2 season is greetings which would have been double the weight of the pants and it was only dollar80uds i read that the size of the box they use also plays into the shipping cost i honestly thought namjoon was inside the box when mine was delivered ,others
60,oh i am sorry for the misunderstanding but pls vent as much as you like cause i can totally understand the frustration crossing my fingers for restocks x,others
61,ahh thank you fingers crossed it is under dollar150aud for the wind chime but i could be dreaming lol,others
62,i will stalk too if u remember let me know and i will message u too  ,others
63,seems like the hue go 2 is better value since it can be used as a reasonably right lamp as well as a portable mood light ,color
64,eve makes solid products but they need more wi fi products besides the light strip having to buy the extend almost forces me to other manufactures ,others
65,written review for those that would like it ,others
66,i put them on the baseboard yesterday and they are very bright any advice on diffusing them ,brightness
67,most of them you can make dimmer,others
68,thanks ,controller
69,looks decent enough you should look into yeelights if you want cheap hubless bulbs usual going rate is gbp10 ,brightness
70,this looks an awful lot like a sonoff b1 clone are there any light meter measurements for various color states ,color
71,ah right will look into those thanks for the tip ,others
72,in terms of lumens do you mean ,brightness
73,so the brightness is 680lm with a color temperature of 6000 kelvin it is not the brightest bulb ever not as bright as the hue in fact but obviously you can control this using the app ,brightness
74,is that a measurement or from a spec sheet ,others
75,that is from the spec sheet i have not measured it myself so it may be slightly different but i can tell you that even at it is brightest it is not exactly blinding ,brightness
76,check out these guys they make high quality led strips and offer free design support for your project ,others
77,hey a few thoughts for you 1 when you say you want them to go along with music do you want crazy effect or just different colors if you are looking for effects you should get individually addressable leds 2 for your mom is migraines the most important thing will be to get a good quality controller otherwise there will be an imperceptible flicker to the leds as they dim which may make her headache worse here is a video that i published just today that may be of use ,controller
78,there is a few good videos out there explaining the difference between a bunch and things that matter for them as it looks like you might end up wanting individually controllable ones i would definitely recommend those videos in addition i would look for ones that have a very high amount of interoperability with other platforms is you can only use it with just their custom app completely ignore it this endures you are not tied down to any one platform and allows for future flexibility and interoperability only other thing i would recommend is that you find the kind where if one led dies it does not kill all others after it good luck ,others
79,i would recommend a rgbw strip they include an extra white diode instead of trying and failing to get white from combining the other 3 colors this gives a much better and warmer white light with proper color ,color
80,if you want a great range of products not made in china check here    the will also cut to length and solder for you if you need,others
81,i can not help you with the actual selection of led lights but i can recommend muzata aluminum led channels they are cheap and designed well and the diffusers really make the lights look better i will say for 48 feet you are going to want 12 volt lights probably 5 wire models 5 volt lights will fade at that distance and the fifth return channel will help ,brightness
82,i bought  for a number of places in my home and they are great they have single and multi color options if that is what you are looking for but the quality has been great and any questions i have had they have answered ,color
83,r gledopto will link you to some affordable smart 20v strip controller combos if you are into that sort of thing,controller
84,wifi automation is not so ready for mainstream so stick with the cheap basic and then but a module later in the future when buying led go with china made because you can get more than what you pay for there is plenty of other things from us that you can buy ,others
85,i agree with flexfire leds they are the best i have used you get what you pay for they have a 15 year warranty free project design and send them back if you do not like the color brightness they will last you forever ,brightness
86,was expecting this video to be junk but it was actually quite useful thanks ,others
87,dang it do you know what kind of rabbit hole you just put me down now i have all sorts of new projects to do around the house lol thanks for the great resource ,others
88,oh hey just connected your username to your blog great stuff i really like how you broke down the various esp8266 pitfalls i will be returning to your blog ,others
89,there a also rgbww with warm white leds instread of the more common cool white ,color
90,also check out this relevant video u darkbunnysc posted 10 hours ago  it is on my watch list should be useful ,others
91,they are working on a controller that will connect to google home their lights are the best their controls need updating if you want it to work with google home i recommend finding a controller elsewhere for it like amazon ,controller
92,nothing against you but there is just so many people peddling their youtube content on reddit trying to get their view time up that often when you find a comment by the videos author it is not necessarily an indication of its quality ,others
93,yes i have found it to be helpful for circadian rhythm disruption i use a 10 000 lux lamp for 10 mins in the morning along with a 5 000 iu vitamin d supplement and melatonin at night it reminds my body when to sleep vs when to wake up ,brightness
94,i am using one right now my limited anecdotal evidence is all positive however ymmv ,controller
95,i have used one and found it moderately helpful but i was not very compliant about using it daily other things i have tried with good results vitamin d supplements 5 000 i u every time i remembered which was basically weekdays and tanning once per week for maybe 10 12 minutes ,others
96,used to have one of those old school fire hazard tochiere halogen lamps halogens work great but they do not sell them anymore i have been toying with the idea of using my halogen work light upstairs while plastering plenty o light as it is to help give me a pep up ,brightness
97,yes yes and yes the exercise is so important ,others
98,where do you get vitamin d gummies ,others
99, the vitamins are absorbed better sure sounds a lot better than because i am a fucking child when people question my gummy multivitamins one time true story we had been smoking and my friend polished off a bottle of them there must have been about 50 in there i actually called poison control to ask if we should go to the hospital or not and they said no but called me back like 45 minutes later to make sure nobody was dying ,controller
100,it looks pretty alright for a mood night light  observations  3 components acrylic insomnia logo with moon plate base with power button battery holder and long usb cable it looks like it can be powered by usb or 3x aa batteries it looks like the power button uses a capacitive touch switch 4 lighting modes 1 red 2 yellow 3 red to yellow 4 yellow to red hold power button to turn off  ,color
101,oh wow that mood light looks really nice dang it sucks i missed out on the signup by under a week next time ,others
102,no this is not me this is from a korean insomnia shipping updates should be soon for international insomnias ,others
103,thanks for the thorough review and swatch pics i hope versed comes out with a more champagne tone some time but defs gonna pick this up in golden,color
104,interesting i would be really interested to see how the glow drops work on pale skin that colour looks good on you but i am not sure it would translate well on very fair skin which it claims to be suitable for ,color
105,i think they also have a bronze ,color
106,same here i hate the sticky tacky feeling of futuredew although i absolutely love the concept ,others
107,it might be because i do not really pay attention to jaclyn but i have heard little to nothing about these since their launch however that might be a good thing after her last launch i am sure jaclyn is just happy that things seemingly went smoothly and people seem satisfied enough that no internet storm has broken out as a result it seems like the products were not anything groundbreaking which is understandable since she is a couple years late to the highlighter game anyway but people seem satisfied and i guess that is all that matters ,others
108,a girl in one of my classes bought the beaming one and still constantly post about it looks fantastic on her but i am not willing to give jaclyn any of my money ,brightness
109,i use it daily i will admit that they are nice but are they really anything that special not realllllly  i also knew she would not post anything after because i do not believe she cares about her channel anymore it is only if she needs to address something or showing a new product ,others
110,she sells the palette for gbp58 on the uk morphe site that is like gbp20 higher than what it should be if she used the exchange rate for an already incredibly over priced palette,color
111,i know angelica nyqvist likes the more subtle loose one and traveled with it to california she likes the others one too but did not think they were to die for or anything ,others
112,i bought the pallet and one of the beaming lights they are buttery smooth and the beaming light is kinda blinding i think they are super pretty and have been using them in my routine since i bought them ,brightness
113,i will preface this by saying although i was once a huge jaclyn fan i am no longer i have purchased almost every single one of her collections minus the lipsticks thank god and been impressed by the quality which is why i keep returning i figured i would give her one last chance with the highlighters seeing as she is created so many of my favorite products and i still love highlighters even if the internet is getting over them however i completely understand why people would not want to purchase from her and do not love the idea myself but i did purchase them with my own money and i was not held at gunpoint so come at me if you want lol i bought the beaming one beaming light and the one meant to mimic the hourglass powders mood light i really enjoy them both honestly but i find the mood light too similar to hourglass or the guerlain meteorites to be worth the purchase it is nothing special my friend who also purchased it though loves it as the hourglass powders are out of reach price wise and the jaclyn ones are also actually pretty decently priced for their size i would pass on purchasing it again but i would not say i regret it the beaming light one though i do find to be special it is absolutely gorgeous on somehow it is sparkly and bright without being clownish or emphasizing texture i do not have another highlighter in my collection which is pretty large in regards to highlighter that i like as much i do however really regret having to buy it from jaclyn i am not a fan anymore and her lipstick launch was awful however i think this launch went smoothly enough and i am impressed enough with the highlighter to at least keep my eye on what comes out next ,brightness
114,i have the luminous powder and love it i have nothing like it in my collection it truly is just a soft glow from within but it is beautiful i feel like it actually makes my makeup look more natural i am not into blinding highlighters so i passed on everything else but i hope they are fake limited edition because it is that good lol,brightness
115,i have seen it pop up in my social media a few times and honestly anything is way more than i would have expected lol ,others
116,i have the flash palette and i absolutely love it i find them to be really flattering i enjoy the formula they are really soft and blend beautifully ,brightness
117,someone upthread said lanc me absolue powders compare favorably with them and are not limited ,others
118, at sephora ,brightness
119,do you maybe mean her becca collab highlighter champagne pop ,brightness
120,me either i will just use my colourpop super shock highlighters thanks i have had one of their ss trios a over a year and just hit pan those suckers last forever ,color
121,i was actually going go try them since i have heard they are similar but man it is so expensive for a powder but since it is not something i use a lot of i may just splurge,others
122,morphe hahahaha,others
123,i love her becca collab personally i have the face palette which i bought three years ago and still use it at least once a week,color
124,she  really said she lost another video even though someone else that she employs and pays records and edits them for her ,others
125,lost another one and has the flu for the 3rd time this year she has not been this sick since she was a teenager tho and completely forgot what it feels like ,others
126,oh i hope it is not another case of gastritis that she ate pizza and doritos whilst allegedly having like 2 times last year also,others

128,what is up i have done quite a lot of research on this i am workin on a full video on the topic expect a video on it this tuesday my solution is discussing an easy low budget under dollar50 solution that will flood your room with color ,color
129,i thoroughly enjoy any time something is posted in this subreddit how many armchair engineers get pissed at the cost  i could make that for dollar5 out of a toaster guess what even if you can chances are you will not let alone program the arduino or integrate it to any smart home system let is say you do all that now you want to produce and sell it you need to price it well enough in order to recover income from time off from your day job spent in r d and material costs of prototyping which would require that requires that the quality is enough to last you and not fall apart as a wafer thin 4 foot stick with kids and dogs cover cost per unit production shipping to you not let alone customer website advertising pay your internet and rent food but sure bitch that the dollar45 lamp does not cost dollar50 dollar175 for something that is not held together with zip ties and electrical tape is not that bad y all mfers spoiled you can buy led bulbs for dollar2 at walgreens  back in my day we traded in spent bulbs at the drug store for reduced price on tungsten bulbs that would maybe last 6 months now get off my lawn s edit thanks for the gold and comments i am a freelance photographer retoucher of oh lord two decades now so i first hand hear but you do not have any material costs so you should not charge me far too often for services you are not paying for the time on the job you are paying for the decades of practice to be able to do the job in that time for physical goods it is similar you are paying for the design and construction that will not light your house on fire or break under a stiff breeze it is nice to see others appreciate the hard work and unseen costs that go into making something like this stay safe stay home wash your hands ,others

134,does it come in other colors ,others
135,this is dollar250 cad fuck that ill buy the 50 dollar counterfeit ,controller
136,these could be engineered or in my case jerry rigged up fairly easily just a stand and a a bight led lights mounted in something vertical probably could make it with an one of those cheap metal brooms,others
137,this is just a fancy way to find out that your walls are not plumb,controller
138,you can make this with copper piping and a color change led strip boom maybe dollar20 dollar30 edit in fact looking at it closer it is probably a long piece of steel square tubing cut up and welded together with a few holes in the frame to pass the power cable through with a literal led strip up the back so if you can weld you can make an exact copy if not the copper pipes and a drill will work fine ,color
139,or as i like to call it the reverse lamp ,brightness
140,what a cool lighting concept i love this lamp ,brightness
141,where is this from link ,others
142,i bought it but have not got it yet shipping problems ,others
143,is it made by razer ,brightness

197,i was looking into light therapy some time ago wanted to get rid of my daytime sleepyness and depression symtoms what i gathered from the available serious research was that the most probable effect comes from exposure to the blue part of the light spectrum under 500 nm wavelength or above 6000k light temperature with human almost 180 degree vision up down and left right it made sense to me that the therapy lamps can hardly replace a sunlit horizon with an also quite luminos world underneath in terms of total retina light exposure not talking about skin  my conclusion than was that these therapy devices were in the end just very good lamps nothing less but also nothing more i think it is important not to get lost in the marketing pitch full spectrum daylight for example has nothing to do with sunlight or its spectrum it just means the lamp produces a bit more of the visible spectrum usually the blue part which is weaker in most artificial indoor lighting or 10 000 lux which is not a really useful statement as lux is lumen per square meter the manufacturer here refers to the surface of the lamp not the surface of the room it lights up so to achieve decent exposure one would have to take up a significan not part of your field of vision so you would have to sit pretty much with your nose pressed to it do not get me wrong reading or working in the light of the lamp might still be nice because they are nice and bright lamps but the therapeutic effects are probably negible  after researching i wanted to spend money for better light and mood all the same so i tried to smoke more around lunch time costs money and gets me outside and i bought 5 bulbs for breakfast area and office similar to ,brightness

211,two words light layering this is so huge and i do not think people give it enough attention when they are decorating their space you need to layer the lighting in your home to achieve that cozy feeling even the most spare minimalist room looks warm and inviting with properly layered lights in fact i would argue it is almost impossible to have a minimalist aesthetic look comfortable without well layered lighting i found  that does a really good job explaining this for anyone interested ,brightness
212,i use ecosmart 60w dimmable led bulbs in 3000k in all the ceiling fixtures and control them with lutron caseta wall dimmers for the floor lamp wood tripod from target i use a philips 100w warm glow bulb which is plugged into a lutron caseta plug in wall dimmer lastly i use a 60w philips warm glow bulb for the nightstand lamp and control it with a manual in line lutron dimmer  the nightstand lamp emits an audible buzz on the dimmed levels and i am not sure if it is the bulb that is incompatible with the lamp or vice versa  i used to use under above cabinet warm white strip leds from hitlights on amazon but i moved to a new place and the lengths are all wrong i am been thinking about doing it again but will probably be moving by the end of summer they were controlled using their rf remote and i had no issues on the quality ,controller

214,anything that shoots light up onto your ceiling will be helpful such as a torchiere because you have white walls the light will hit the ceiling and instead of being absorbed like if you had a dark ceiling it will bounce around the space also adding an arc floor lamp like the one the moderator re posted brooklyn arc lamp for more task lighting above a sofa would be stylish and functional good luck on lighting your new space ,brightness

219, lighting should be unobtrusive thank god this is just your opinion instead of some kind of official fact i love having lights that shift and change color like a breathing or moving cycle while i am relaxing and reading or on the computer or really doing anything where i am sitting in the same place for extended periods ,color
220,i did this to my kids bed frame and he loves it otherwise for me personally i mostly have just tunable bulbs which change to warmer in the evening but my color lighting i do use for my part of holiday decoration and i use a nice dim red in certain areas at night the crazy racing lights and all that wled can do is neat but i almost never use that part of the software though i will when i get a hyperion instance going for color bias tv lighting ,color

226,what shade are you in other cushions do you normally go for a 23 this sounds really interesting but the pink part has me hesitating a bit,others
227,hey did you use any moisturizer underneath ,others
228,i did not set with powder i tested this cushion out in two different climates one being a very humid one and it seemed to hold up well enough i would not call it oil minimizing though whatever bit of shine i usually get did peak through to some extent the other climate it was tested in is the northeastern us which was quite cold when i tested it out i experienced no drying or clinging to dry patches for reference my t zone can get oily in humid weather and my u zone tends to be on the dry end year round moreso during the winter however ,brightness
229,yes i normally do go for a 23 in the sulwhasoo cushion i mentioned earlier i used a 25 and i also have used a 25 in pony effect everlasting cushion both which are slightly pulling too red thus making my skintone look very dull 23s on the more yellow toned spectrum tend to work best with my skin missha m magic cushion moisture is probably the closest a cushion has come to my skintone from the ones i have tried ,color
230,hmmmm i see thanks for your reply i havent used sulwhasoo before but i also have the pony effect everlasting cushion but i bought that in nude beige 23 i think and its a tad too light the missha m magic cushion moisture i have in 23 though is a tad too dark yellowy makes life hard when you can not try these cushions out beforehand,color

232,do you have a picture of what it looks like just because this is me if you are buying a car you should get something if you even remotely like it if i had that option at all to get it i absolutely would have as it is more of a enjoyable experience to have almost mood lighting in the car while you drive at night ,brightness
233,currently dealing with it not a fan of how i was treated as a consumer ,others
234,i recently bought mood light which has a slight pink cool undertone i am fair light with neutral undertones and this shade really works for me i usually do not use powder over my whole face but i got this hoping it would add a slight blurring effect without emphasizing my dry skin in short it gives me a nice subtle sheen and does not emphasize texture however imo it is nothing revolutionary or spectacular my skin looks basically the same with or without the powder given i do not use very much just slightly more glowy i can notice the difference on my face but no one else could i am not sure i will repurchase but it does make me feel extravagant classy every time i use it i certainly do not regret buying it even though the effects are minimal ,color
235,i think i have ethereal light i do a layer over my foundation and setting powder i agree it does not make you look dewy at all just like you have good healthy skin it is a nice but not necessary step i also use it by itself on just mascara and brows days i will put on a little pore filling primer a little glowy primer under my eyes and a generous amount of this powder all over and i really enjoy using it like that,brightness
236,i have the pale yellow one and use shade 2 in giorgio armani luminous silk foundation i really like it it does soften the look of my base and i think it helps with the appearance of my pores it is the only powder ive tried that does not look like i have powdered my face it actually takes away a little bit of the luminosity of my foundation but i do not mind since it is so glowy to start with the resulting finish looks like healthy skin not over the top dewy ,brightness
237,stephanie nicole on yt has a video that goes through all of them at the time not sure if there are more now and the differences uses well i personally have ethereal light this is my second after panning my first last year it took about a year to do that maybe a bit more it is great for setting liquid foundation and concealer for me i use both of those lightly and do not really get creasing so i would not say it is a replacement to a setting powder if you need setting powder it is really more a finishing powder and for dry skin especially can sort of liven up the skin i have rather dry skin that can look flat and dull easily so this gives a little sheen honestly unless you are using a lot at once this is not really a product that people will notice if you stop using it i do not mind that i am probably the only person that notices a difference when i wear it but i do get why that would not make it worth it to others ,brightness
238,i have the pale yellow one which i think is diffused light i use a bunch of mattifying products and i found that using the alp after everything else so after foundation setting powder and setting spray would just make me look so healthy it is kind of weird it just makes you look great i also found that i kind of had a habit of over applying blush and not realizing it until after i had applied the setting spray and using the alp over it sort of fixed my mistakes recently i have been using a foundation with a really nice finish fenty and i have not been using the alp as much anymore because the foundation already looks so good ,color
239,i have got dim light diffused light and ethereal light and i have tried mood light my undertones are cool olive and quite muted using them on bare skin particularly in combination really gives a subtly healthy look dim light was the wrong choice for me and i did not understand undertones at the time i bought it it has a lovely non glittery glow and blur effect but on me it reads as a peachy orange blush because it is warm toned diffused light is my favourite it is cool toned enough to blend in and gives a slight blur and luminosity it feels like a souped up version of the meteorites ethereal light can be a little stark on me but it does seem to capture the look of moonlight on skin a non glittery cool toned glow i have heard that they reformulated though  mood light is a neutral to warm pink with a satiny sheen i liked the sheen but did not notice any brightening it pulled quite warm pink on me and gave more of a light sunburn effect i suspect it would work nicely as a neutral blush on fair to light cool tones ,color
240,i have the travel sized version of dim light and i really do not notice any difference with and without it it literally does nothing if it does do anything then it is so minimal that i do not really care it was not even that expensive compared to the full size but i still feel a bit duped i would not repurchase it but i am still trying to play around with it and see if i can finally make it look like it does anything on my face i wish it worked the way other people say it does but i look the same before and after ,others
241,it does nothing for me i have the 3 pan hourglass palette not a one of the colors makes a difference one way or the other on my face with the exception of the darkest one that leaves a bit of glitter on my face i am super annoyed that i bought it ,color
242,i have ethereal light the super pale white pink and diffused light the pale yellow my skin is dry so i have to use them sparingly but they give a lovely soft luminous glow etheral light is a little more reflective than diffused light so i use it more on my high points and the other shade everywhere else ,color
243,thanks for commenting i am considering both mood and dim light ,others
244,thank you for adding to the conversation your comment was really helpful also it seems obvious to consider undertones when choosing i missed that completely ,others
245,thanks for commenting i would try to watch some youtube videos on it and try it out may be it would work for you the role of each type of powder is confusing for sure,others
246,i was gonna get dim light for the longest time but when i actually went in store i found mood more brightening it definitely depends on your undertone though ,brightness
247,i have warm olive undertone so i think mood light will play nicely according to a theory i heard from a korean mua that pink color in general would neutralize the olive undertone,color
248,cool idea applying alp after everything i apply it before all my other powders i must try this ,others
249,what an excellent idea i will have to try that thanks ,others
250,this collection feels so dated tbh like something that should have been released years ago when obnoxious highlighting was more of a thing lol,brightness
251,kathleen has really mastered the art of saying she likes something but giving signals even if unconscious that she really does not thought the glow from within powders would be my fav but it looks like it is not glowy enough and the beaming light powders seem too metallic for what is in trend right now the palettes look nice tho ,brightness
252,as someone stated this launch seems dated but so does the brand the products she is coming out with do not seem creative while i understand in an over saturated industry that can be hard but some originality should show she is taking make up she likes and recreating it with her name on it seems more like instead of this brand being a trendsetter its going to be a trend follower but from jaclyn is prime youtube days not to mention the products pricing is equivalent to a high end brand that has a good reputation this was a new company that had one launch that was a terrible product and handled poorly seems like customers are paying for all those refunds in a different way kathleen you can tell felt uncomfortable reviewing this collection it felt like some influencers were being pushed to review this collection by subscribers ,others
253,does anyone else feel like jaclyn just remade the highlighters she likes from other brands like i totally get the marker is saturated and it is hard to make something unique but as someone whose job it is to review makeup it is a little sus that out of the three things she released two of them are exact copies of products from other brands and the other is just like a standard basic product ,others
254,like others have said this video was a little awkward for me to watch because kathleen was obviously walking on eggshells i do not typically take influencers reviewing each other is products too seriously though because they all seem afraid to say anything negative about the products as for the names not being on the products this is not the first time jaclyn has done this either with the lipsticks i do not think anyone even knew they were called the so rich lipsticks ,others
255,i will be passing on this collection i do not think metallic stripes on my face,color
256,so much highlight and she never did the nose interesting and weird what she said about the products not including the titles jaclyn used ,brightness
257,i am surprised she would even make a video about this brand considering the snapchat thing with jaclyn forever ago,others
258,i feel like jaclyn is whole vibe is a couple years out of date,others
259,yep i watched that video and was like k got it she hates them and they suck ,others
260,i agree the market is very saturated and it is been hard to be impressed by any new releases but then there are releases like the amor eterno collection by melt that are so well executed and clearly made with a lot of thought so it is not entirely impossible to make an exciting product i think jaclyn really had to have blown it out of the water with her new launch to redeem herself after the lipstick incident and this highlighter collection is so uninspiring and dated it seems like she is phoning it in big time ,brightness
261,completely unrelated but what does gate mean in the way you used it i know the us had a thing called watergate but never really knew what it meant is it another meaning for controversy ,others
262,because that is exactly what she did lol in all her recent videos she gushes about lanc me is loose glowy powder and kylie is loose powder highlighter,brightness
263,i think she is just trying to be polite but you can low key tell when she does not like a product ,others
264,she is been really bad at saying anything negative lately about products so unless she gushes and provides specifics i assume she hates it ,others
265,i do not know if jaclyn reached out or if kathleen felt awkward because in general she seems to dislike saying things against collabs negatively reviewing products or the whole snapchat thing with her and jaclyn i imagine it is hard talking about a past beautyguru is scandal when you have had your own scandal that that person was indirectly involved in edit this is not me saying something for or against either of them just my thoughts on why she could possibly be awkward about reviewing this launch ,others
266,i felt the same way i watched the video before this thread was posted and i felt like she was trying really hard to be nice the whole time which is disappointing she did not even mention how pricey they are and for a brand with no credibility thass esspensive ,others
267,i read that the highlighters were made in the same lab as the shitty lipsticks with proof in the labels having the same batch numbers and saying made in the usa when she is pushing the whole milan thing with only one product being made there so of course she is going to rely on influencers to sell that stock so she does not lose money and if that means guilting and paying people then she will do it ,brightness
268,weeeellll kathleen has nobody to blame but herself for that one ,controller
269,i did not think she looked oily but glowy which i loved but for real i did not see a fucking difference with the first product and for dollar32  nah if anybody needs me i will be at ulta getting that essence highlighter she mentioned lol,brightness
270,i think the names thing is probably because she actually did not get usage of the names as they are too similar to the hourglass ones ,others
271,but she has like 11000 likes so  i mean i do not care for the review but 500 dislikes compared to 11000 likes is not a lot ,others
272,well yeah she has not made content that was not a commercial since highlight like that was a trend,brightness
273,exactly and why the f would i purchase from jaclyn shill instead of hourglass a cruelty free classy prestige brand it is a no for me,others
274,in empties videos and stuff like that she is said this is honestly garbage when she really disliked something but typically she tries to be nice and not bash the product and instead says the product is not for her or maybe she is using it wrong but yeah she is not the most critical reviewer unless it is literal trash,others
275,she actually does she is said many many times when she dislikes something ,others
276,the watergate was the name of a building that was the location of a spying scandal that led to president nixon is resignation now adding gate after another word is just american shorthand for huge scandal ,others
277,yes it is cause typically anything having to do with gate and the year is a train wreck of epic proportions lol i love attaching it to different scandals ,others
278,i think the singles in her palette were actually mac and makeup geek back in the day jaclyn was really big on mac,color
279, truth,controller
280,especially if you have seen how kathleen gushes when she actually loves something ,others
281,can you provide that source ,others
282,kathleen went to jaclyn is florida mansion to collab with her they hung out after playing some horror vr game with their husbands this was still when jaclyn was with her ex kathleen was tipsy and freaking out over the game jaclyn was snapchating the whole thing and in one of them jaclyn was laughing as kathleen flipped out and said the n word so there was a whole drama whether jaclyn posted it on purpose or not to make kathleen look bad imo i am not black so i can not tell anyone to get over it and will not police people who give her a hard time for it but i do not think it is jaclyn is fault that the word came out of kathleen is mouth and she happened to post it they both apologized but the collab video never saw the light of day ,color
283,bc that is when she peaked,brightness
284,this as someone with anxiety i will almost always avoid confrontation and drama ,others
285,i knew that do not know why i typed morphe ,others
286,i used to do hair jaclyn reminds me of the women who would not change their hair or makeup from what they would worn in highschool or college whenever they would felt their best it was sad because even small changes could have updated their look and made them look their new best but they just can not move into the present ,others
287,then being a beauty youtuber may not have been the best option to take for her,brightness
288,oh man you have hit a big fear of mine lol i really glowed up in college and with my hair i think a specific but simple haircut looks best on me it is just long layers cut in a v shape but it makes me feel good,brightness

290,hey there at one point i owned all of the hourglass ambient lighting powder shades i am fair with cool neutral undertones mac shade nw10  i can tell you that the only two that will probably work on your skin tone are ethereal light and diffused light dim light could maybe work but it is fairly golden and actually worked on me as a subtle bronzer luminous light and radiant light were very dark and muddy looking on my fair skin luminous was straight up orange mood light makes a perfect glowy blush for me but i can not use it all over my face since it is quite pink as far as how shimmery they are they vary a lot from shade to shade ethereal and diffused have very little shimmer and are just glowy and beautiful for all over the skin mood light is the same and works on the cheeks i would still use a highlighter on top of them if you are into highlighting and want the high points of your face to have an intense glow luminous dim and radiant light all had quite a bit more shimmer in my opinion i also have oily skin and i would apply my foundation concealer and normal setting powder and then would use the hourglass powders on top they are finishing powders which is technically different than setting powder so they are meant to be a last step if you skipped the setting powder you would likely get very shiny throughout the day i actually only own mood light now because i always felt that the other hourglass powder colors were just not quite right for my skin tone too brown radiant too orange luminous too golden dim or too yellow diffused ethereal light was okay since it is just a sheer white powder but i did not find it to be worth almost dollar50 since it was so subtle i fell in love with the laura mercier candleglow sheer perfecting powder in fair it is like a perfect mix between ethereal dim and mood light and it is so lovely on my skin that i feel like i only need this one finishing powder forever it has some coverage and really blurs my pores which i did not quite get from the hourglass ones hopefully this helps you decide ,color
291,1 if you are oily definitely set before they are finishing powders made to smooth and diffuse texture and refract light they do not set very much in terms of holding product in place but work beautifully all over the skin to blend everything out 2 for the shade it depends what kind of effect you are going for diffused light is good for brightening and helping even out redness luminous will warm up your pale complexion a bit more i would use luminous all over after doing your bronzer and blush to blend everything seamlessly dim light is also a great colour for people on the paler side i am shade oslo in nars radiant longwear and it works beautifully 3 i still wear highlight as i like a very visible glow however with the lighter shades you could definitely use it as a soft highlight shades like mood light or ethereal light 4 i find they are worth it if it is a product that sounds like what you are looking for despite the price tag i have had mine almost 6 months and have barely made a dent in it same thing with the bronzers ,color
292,worth it yes i had diffused for years until i hit pan and then i rebought it and i hit pan on nothing it is a lovely low glow on me that i use in place of setting powder these days but do not let the finishing powder thing determine how you use it in the beginning and still for any long outside days or i think i will photographed a lot my routine starts with this in other words moisture prime hourglass powder foundation and setting powder if it is unholy hot this results in a healthy skin effect that lasts forever but does not break down if i get sweaty oily in my t zone i think i picked that trick up from a wayne goss youtube actually ,brightness
293,use individually addressable leds and a cheap o controller with mobile support ws2812b is and magic led controller on amazon for diffusion look on amazon for led channels ,controller
294,paint some cheap aluminum channeling from a hardware store diffuse it however you see fit since it is facing a wall individually addressable strips and controllers are very cheap from amazon since you do not need a very long length,controller
295,the original version is remote controlled dimmable and you can combine any two colors should i look for a single strip that can display two colors or 2 separate strips would be easier ,color
296,what do you plan to use for the frame of the lamp i saw this lamp on instagram the other day and had the same thought as you ,others
297,thank you all for your answers ,others
298,just made two based off this light used two 4 foot sections of aluminum corner and tacked it onto some aluminum feet used a smart led strip so they can be turned off on and color adjusted via google pretty simple to do but looks really good ,color
299,currently making this myself using a d1 mini esp8266 w wled firmware wifi webui can be used with alexa google assistant through ifttt and has a android ios app to control it and some 1 2 pvc corner is a 3 way 2 legs and the main shaft there are places online that sell furniture grade pvc parts which come in many colors such as black and have a gloss finish is one place they also sell on amazon mine is going behind a couch so its appearance will not be visible you can also find diffused led strips almost anywhere online amazon banggood aliexpress ebay the measurements of the one pictured is legs 40cm 15 7 in height 142cm 56 in ,color
300,2 strips and 2 controllers would be the easiest way or diy a controller with an arduino or an esp to save some money another easy option would be adressable leds and an cheap esp with some pre written code ,controller
301,use ws2813 led strip link  each led can have its own color and to control those leds if i were you i would use arduino or you can use simple controller from aliexpress link  also do not forget 5v powersupply,controller
302,awesome do you mind sharing a picture of it ,others
303,how much did all this cost you in total ,others
304,does it get as bright as the stock photos show the light coming from the leds does not seem to light up the room like the advertisement shows ,brightness
305,i am making my version based on yours right now at the junction of the aluminum angle and the aluminum channel did you just jb weld it together or did you also have an l bracket there as well thanks ,others
306,around 60gbp if you do not count a few tools i needed retail price is 180gbp and mine has double the amount of leds d,others
307,mine has double the amount of leds that the advertised products it gets pretty bright ,brightness
308,but the other three which are in hidden corners where no one passes by are completely fine so i guess it depends on where you will be putting it but adding a bracket should also help so yeah do that ,others
309,here is another tip the lamp does not have to be full spectrum it only has to have the blue wavelengths so you can get something like  for instance and it will still work fine the retinal neurons that project to circadian areas only have the blue photoreceptor not red or green ,others
310,do you find the vitamin d a help or would the light alone be enough now that you are using it correctly ,brightness
311,why not do this and use it at work where the lights are so much dimmer ,others
312,seasonal affective disorder sad is a type of depression that typically occurs each year during fall and winter use of a light therapy box can offer relief but for some people light therapy may be more effective when combined with another sad treatment such as an antidepressant or psychological counseling psychotherapy light therapy boxes for sad treatment are also known as light boxes bright light therapy boxes and phototherapy boxes all light therapy boxes for sad treatment are designed do the same thing but one may work better for you than another ,brightness
313,why would not a computer monitor work they are designed to have the same color temperature as the sun or even bluer ,color
314,and who are you ,others
315,computer monitors can be harmful which is why apps like  are so popular i do not think they are typically bright enough to be helpful though i know looking directly at my lamp can be painful i use f lux so my sleep is not disturbed too much when i have to work late at night then use the lamp to wake up trying to make my body think i have retired to the tropics already ,brightness
316,well good morning the sunrise light is not subtle more like an intergalactic death ray the waves and chaotic robot birds are not as horrid as i feared and the 2 minutes passed quickly the sound of my wife laughing at me at the clock at both was nice ,brightness
317,i was just awoken by mine i bough got it it after reading your positive review i did find that the light got more gradually bright such that i was aware of it but not fully awake before it went off which is a nice way to start the day i agree about the nature sounds not at all relaxing and more hey get out of bed now but that is more useful in an alarm pleasantly surprised at how easy the buttons were to use ,brightness
318,angry cows have been waking me up for the last week quite effective but i think i will try the fm next time can not imagine what the neighbors think is going on in my apartment at 6 15 am ,others
319,so i love the light on the alarm living in the north it helps when trying to wake up in the dark but this clock misses in so many other ways if you hit any button other than snooze it is off and snooze is very close to the other buttons also the buttons are smooth and flat there are no tactile clues to help you find the correct button and it is a bit painful on the eyes to look at the clock and find the correct button which you have to so because you can not feel for the button since they turn off with a gentle touch so fumble around at all and this thing is off the point of the nature sounds is to wake you up i think it would have been better to wake up to a normal alarm sound if the light has not woken you yet and have the nature sounds be soothing and something you can turn in at bedtime and have them run for 30 minutes as you fall asleep the radio is weird it does not have a dial it is just supposed to find all the stations and then you sit and select them one by one until you find the one you want so i love the light and will keep using it for that feature but i will have a back up alarm also minimal design can be cool but designers need to think about usability and what helps is use products and get the most from them coolness over usability is a pet peeve of mine also the first time i used it it either did not work or i turned it off without waking up testing it since it has worked fine but ,brightness
320,so the radio only stores 30 stations i can not set it to my favorite station because it fills up with other stations just before getting to it boo,others
321,does the light sunset as well or just sunrise i still saw some of these at my local aldi and wanted to suggest it to a friend to help her get to sleep but wanted to make sure it had that function ,brightness
322, more like an intergalactic death ray lol i do not have this aldi clock but i have a similar one by lacrosse technologies it clicks on with increasing brightness in 5 stages about 60 seconds apart the first click alone is bright enough to wake me up one thing i did was cut out a circle from yellow paper and tape it over the light it helps soften the harsh light so it is not so bright ,brightness
323,i wear a sleep mask think it would shine through ,brightness
324,mine goes from 10percent brightness to 100percent brightness in about 5 seconds you can see it jumping through the brightness levels is that what yours is doing too trying to figure out if mine is defective or if that is how they programmed it,brightness
325,light therapy or  has been in use for a number of years i have seen a few episodes of oddities that have shown such devices i do not believe that their effectiveness in treating some of the diseases they were supposed to is effective but there are other applications by no means am i an expert on it but it is widely know that light exposure does affect peoples mood and is necessary to a degree for example seasonal affective disorder aptly named  has been shown to be treatable via light therapy also and biliruben levels have been shown to be affected by sunlight it seems to me that it is kindof legit in the sense that yes it does help and affects mood but such a device might be more helpful with your mental state rather than actually doing anything physically though it is often times hard to say that your mental state does not factor into how your body responds which is an entirely different issue  edit to answer your basic question it might work for the device you showed but mental state is a fickle thing to study edit2 clarify add to answer edit 3  basically it covers the same wavelengths of light that would be present in phototherapy seems like a case of tl dr go outside for a bit or sit by a sunny window and save yourself some money ,others
326,i have non 24 hour circadian rhythm free running disorder and these do work the light from the machine is incredibly bright i used it as a flashlight once and everything took on an eerily different color the blue light to the best of my understanding is meant to simulate intense uv frequencies of light exposure to it from my experiences at least is almost like a simulated sunrise which helps to wake you ,brightness
327,this  favorably comparing light therapy to flouxetine prozac for sad convinced me to get one it is not my field so i did not analyze it carefully but here is the conclusion from the paper  light treatment showed earlier response onset and lower rate of some adverse events relative to fluoxetine but there were no other significan not differences in outcome between light therapy and antidepressant medication although limited by lack of a double placebo condition this study supports the effectiveness and tolerability of both treatments for seasonal affective disorder and suggests that other clinical factors including patient preference should guide selection of first line treatment  ,brightness
328,i had a friend that had a disorder in the spectrum of aspergers autism his mood was affected greatly by warmth light he had to have a specialized light heat lamp in his dorm while studying or he would get super cranky not gonna lie i feel a lot better when it is a sunny day so there might be some truth to it that being said you will probably see real results for people that have a disorder and actually need a device like this ,brightness
329,a quote the philips golite blu plus hf3332 is clinically proven to naturally boost your mood and energy and fight winter blues in as little as 15 minutes a day these people are just asking to be sued i can not believe this claim got past the corporate legal department it is an absolutely absurd claim without scientific evidence that is would work for any purchaser or without a legitimate tested explanation for how it works on the other hand there are plenty of similar absurd claims for totally bogus products maybe they just decided to roll the dice ,others
330,hyperbilirubinemia jaundice of the newborn is almost exclusively to this day treated with phototherapy there are drugs other methods availabile to treat it but light is still the preferred treatment method for newborns edit clarity since there are other treatment options but not truly drugs to the best of my knowledge ,brightness
331,did not take a look at the specific product listed by op but i think these things emit high levels of light not just low ,brightness
332,well the thing is it could be a placebo effect the mind is powerful enough to affect your health so compared to people who do nothing putting a light in front of them that is supposed to be therapy could show clinically significan not results however the study could have been poorly designed to give it but without the actual study we do not know ,brightness
333,that is pretty cool actually i assume that there are a lot of quack devices out there as well edit clarity ,others
334,i am not a doctor and this is not medical advice there is strong evidence that bright light therapies are effective treatments for circadian rhythm disorders the therapy generally progresses like this the bright light is positioned in front of your face as you are waking up 3 4 days each week if the goal is to roll back your waking time then you move back the time you wake up and go to sleep by 20 min per week you do the opposite if the goal is to move forward your waking time this generally works to stabilize circadian rhythms and can help with associated symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness insomnia etc 4 hours in either direction is generally the maximum circadian change one can induce brushing teeth making breakfast and getting ready upon waking if all done outside in bright sunlight would have a very similar effect the point of the bright lights is to be able to carry the unit around to your bathroom sink kitchen table etc so as to more precisely control the istimulation of the blue light circadian rhythm modulating signal ,brightness
335,i would have to agree i have not look at any of the studies surrounding phototherapy for other illness but the whole blue light for acne thing has never been explained clearly to my satisfaction perhaps someone else can shed light on that dermatology is not my specialty ,others
336,thanks man hard to tell out of all the brands what are great and what are duds just got my first led strip today and i can tell it is a dud on to govee ,others
337,wow awesome this is exactly what i was looking for only thing is i have the lg gn83ab and it does not have usb ports however i am looking for a 2nd monitor and i may get the version with usb ports will i run into much trouble connecting these to my tower if i run the light strips behind my monitor and behind the desk with out showing wires i also have i nice cable race way under my uplift desk would a usb hub come in handy in this case ,others
338,sorry i do not have direct experience with content aware lighting but i would say this chinese made ones work fine except their software is pretty bad you can try out some chinese alternatives on amazon and if they do not work for you then return it and get a hue kit ,others
339,usb ports will be able to handle the light strips for sure,brightness
340,i recently bought mood light which has a slight pink cool undertone i am fair light with neutral undertones and this shade really works for me i usually do not use powder over my whole face but i got this hoping it would add a slight blurring effect without emphasizing my dry skin in short it gives me a nice subtle sheen and does not emphasize texture however imo it is nothing revolutionary or spectacular my skin looks basically the same with or without the powder given i do not use very much just slightly more glowy i can notice the difference on my face but no one else could i am not sure i will repurchase but it does make me feel extravagant classy every time i use it i certainly do not regret buying it even though the effects are minimal ,color
341,i think i have ethereal light i do a layer over my foundation and setting powder i agree it does not make you look dewy at all just like you have good healthy skin it is a nice but not necessary step i also use it by itself on just mascara and brows days i will put on a little pore filling primer a little glowy primer under my eyes and a generous amount of this powder all over and i really enjoy using it like that,brightness
342,i have the pale yellow one and use shade 2 in giorgio armani luminous silk foundation i really like it it does soften the look of my base and i think it helps with the appearance of my pores it is the only powder ive tried that does not look like i have powdered my face it actually takes away a little bit of the luminosity of my foundation but i do not mind since it is so glowy to start with the resulting finish looks like healthy skin not over the top dewy ,brightness
343,stephanie nicole on yt has a video that goes through all of them at the time not sure if there are more now and the differences uses well i personally have ethereal light this is my second after panning my first last year it took about a year to do that maybe a bit more it is great for setting liquid foundation and concealer for me i use both of those lightly and do not really get creasing so i would not say it is a replacement to a setting powder if you need setting powder it is really more a finishing powder and for dry skin especially can sort of liven up the skin i have rather dry skin that can look flat and dull easily so this gives a little sheen honestly unless you are using a lot at once this is not really a product that people will notice if you stop using it i do not mind that i am probably the only person that notices a difference when i wear it but i do get why that would not make it worth it to others ,brightness
344,i have the pale yellow one which i think is diffused light i use a bunch of mattifying products and i found that using the alp after everything else so after foundation setting powder and setting spray would just make me look so healthy it is kind of weird it just makes you look great i also found that i kind of had a habit of over applying blush and not realizing it until after i had applied the setting spray and using the alp over it sort of fixed my mistakes recently i have been using a foundation with a really nice finish fenty and i have not been using the alp as much anymore because the foundation already looks so good ,color
345,i have got dim light diffused light and ethereal light and i have tried mood light my undertones are cool olive and quite muted using them on bare skin particularly in combination really gives a subtly healthy look dim light was the wrong choice for me and i did not understand undertones at the time i bought it it has a lovely non glittery glow and blur effect but on me it reads as a peachy orange blush because it is warm toned diffused light is my favourite it is cool toned enough to blend in and gives a slight blur and luminosity it feels like a souped up version of the meteorites ethereal light can be a little stark on me but it does seem to capture the look of moonlight on skin a non glittery cool toned glow i have heard that they reformulated though  mood light is a neutral to warm pink with a satiny sheen i liked the sheen but did not notice any brightening it pulled quite warm pink on me and gave more of a light sunburn effect i suspect it would work nicely as a neutral blush on fair to light cool tones ,color
346,i have the travel sized version of dim light and i really do not notice any difference with and without it it literally does nothing if it does do anything then it is so minimal that i do not really care it was not even that expensive compared to the full size but i still feel a bit duped i would not repurchase it but i am still trying to play around with it and see if i can finally make it look like it does anything on my face i wish it worked the way other people say it does but i look the same before and after ,others
347,it does nothing for me i have the 3 pan hourglass palette not a one of the colors makes a difference one way or the other on my face with the exception of the darkest one that leaves a bit of glitter on my face i am super annoyed that i bought it ,color
348,i have ethereal light the super pale white pink and diffused light the pale yellow my skin is dry so i have to use them sparingly but they give a lovely soft luminous glow etheral light is a little more reflective than diffused light so i use it more on my high points and the other shade everywhere else ,color
349,thanks for commenting i am considering both mood and dim light ,others
350,thank you for adding to the conversation your comment was really helpful also it seems obvious to consider undertones when choosing i missed that completely ,others
351,thanks for commenting i would try to watch some youtube videos on it and try it out may be it would work for you the role of each type of powder is confusing for sure,others
352,i was gonna get dim light for the longest time but when i actually went in store i found mood more brightening it definitely depends on your undertone though ,brightness
353,i have warm olive undertone so i think mood light will play nicely according to a theory i heard from a korean mua that pink color in general would neutralize the olive undertone,color
354,cool idea applying alp after everything i apply it before all my other powders i must try this ,others
355,what an excellent idea i will have to try that thanks ,others
356,ahhh this explains a lot for me i ordered from beautynetkorea for the first time a few days ago and did not expect to get my order for a few weeks i have ordered products from sk from ebay before and they took about 2 weeks to come in i was shocked this morning when i woke up to an email from beautynetkorea saying my order had shipped immediately followed by an email from dhl stating my package would be here monday i was wondering how that happened since i had not chosen dhl now it makes sense so cool they randomly upgrade like that ,others
357,another thing is keeping track of korean public holidays in my experience the sites do not always notify you hey we will not be working the next two weeks  ,others
358,an addendum to the rose rose shop one is their new ruby ruby shop not the ebay one the website itself it is fabulous shipping for anything at all is just dollar2 50 and prices and other details are the same as rose rose the downside no samples zilch nada nuffink i requested specifically and my third order was more than dollar250 and i did not even get a foil sachet of a random toner for 1ml not even the ubiquitous benton aloe thingy ,others
359,can anyone recommend a shop that ships to eu specifically spain i just got into ab 6 months ago and still use ebay a lot and it takes so long to get the products like 2 weeks to a full month some products are available on spanish amazon but very few brands and they often come with a huge mark up ,others
360,no one use gmarket there is much larger than all above mentioned site lowest price and loads of sample gift i tried testerkorea it is super slow a bit pricy compared to gmarket and no samples included roseroseshop too a bit pricy but they include samples ,others
361,i think stylekorean and masksheets com are also both pretty good there is minimum shipping but they seem to have more sales on higher quality products plus i get 50 cents in credit when i review my orders you are supposed to be able to do that with jolse too but i can never attach pictures ,others
362,i have only made one order form sweetcorea it was at christmant so i was expecting super long wait times it turned up a week later  good christmas present for myself ,brightness
363,roseroseshop is like that too i check the ebay and main site to do a full cost breakdown lol,others
364,oh yes i forgot about that this is especially necessary during lunar new year christmas and chuseok and if you are in the us keeping track of the time zones also helps ,others
365,not op but dokodemo and amazon co jp ,others
366,also yesstyle carries japanese products as well ,others
367,i remember reading that yes i have definitely noticed that with yesstyle if i am researching a particular product and search it up lots of times the price moves around a bit lots of facebook ads based on what i have searched up too ,others
368,ymmv as to the return policy some places do others do not ,others
369,everything mentioned here except for etude house ships to the eu ,others
370,sorry to pony off of this but have you found anyone i might just have to order off ebay,others
371,its not baked into the pricing and varies by weight,others
372,agree that the packing sucks ,others
373,you might need to use a forwarding service like tenso for that ,controller
374,i actually filtered the items that are available via amazon global shipping yet they will not still ship it ,others
375,i have checked tenso before and compared priced from other stores like dokodemo tenso ends up being more expensive because of the shipping i think dokodemo is the place for large hauls ,others
376,what is the price difference between the two again ,others
377,thanks for the review yeah every time a fixture is rated for 75w or 1000w the 800 lumen bulb is going to fall short  i have an up shining floor lamp in the corner of the room that had an older 800 lumen white and color lamp in it and i always felt like it was not bright enough i would say that a small room needs at least 2 x 800 lumen bulbs in the ceiling when the bulbs are shining down and a medium sized room needs at least 3 plus task and accent lights so when you are reflecting the light via the ceiling some of the light will be absorbed by the ceiling while its distance also increases the distance from light bulb to ceiling and then onto the surfaces in the room it is a much longer route due to the inverse square law adding distance causes light to decay faster than one might intuitively think near the bulb the light is highly concentrated and dense but with distance it spreads further and further apart and the amount of light falling per each square foot is going to be less resulting into a dimmer appearance i would compare it to spraying water from a spray bottle and how much that spray can wet a cloth from a close distance vs further away the spray at a distance will be less dense and therefore less efficient at wetting something that the brightness of a light is 100percent at one meter is distance two meters away you will not have 50percent left but just 25percent four meters away it is only 6percent so you can imagine what happens when you reflect it via a surface if you want to use it as general lighting instead of an accent light indeed you are going to need a much brighter bulb than you would in a fixture that shines the light directly into the environment without reflecting via something first standing uplighters typically used to have a halogen lamp at the top for this very reason so the 1600 lumen hue bulb is the right call  but in my use case rich colors do not need to be that bright two reasons first reason is that our eyes do not perceive colors to be as bright as white is because not all of the receptor cells of the eye will be firing and out of the colors we perceive red and especially blue to be darker and yellows and greens to be brighter even if they are set to equal luminosities green color causes two different types of receptors to fire blue causes just one type of receptors to fire and the same goes for extreme red second reason is that white light is the sum of all the colors so when you set a color changing light bulb to a non white color less of the leds are on which inevitably results to less absolute luminosity than with white light where all the leds in there are participating  despite being a lot brighter it actually runs a tiny bit cooler than the previous generation bulbs that is very surprising is the bulb base a bit taller than with the 800 lumen one could it be that it would have otherwise been hotter but a new adaptation with the shape allows for better heat dissipation ,brightness
378,i agree with you just posted about my similar experience here ,others
379, and if your fixture can accommodate it there is no reason to buy the previous generation how about because my wallet can not accommodate it dollar60 lightbulb is insane just to get brighter whites let alone a smart bulb ,brightness
380,i have 8x 800lm bulbs split in to 2 groups of 4 in lamps in my living room i think what people often do not realise is that perceived light output is not linear 4x 800lm bulbs are perceptively to me at least twice as bright twice as much light output as a single 800lm bulb this is because lumens are measured logarithmically ,brightness
381,i show about a dollar10 difference 59 99 vs 49 99 pretty marginal actually if they made a br30 version i would really want 4 of them for my living room the 60 watts are just a little too dim when i am trying to really light up my house and i totally agree about the color being for mood lighting primarily ,color
382,your mention of how ceiling bounced light is less efficient definitely applies to this room three of the bulbs in here are like that this room is a combination office study and is about 10x11 feet it has the above mentioned ceiling firing lamp it is like one of those old halogen lamps but with an edison socket the bulb is about 6 feet off the floor so about 2 feet from the 8 foot white ceiling a tiffany style lamp on a desk with an 800 lumen bulb and two 650 lumen br30s also pointing upwards on top of a wall unit that is about 1 5 feet from the ceiling so that is two 650s an 800 and the one 1600 now the room finally feels bright enough unlike before with 800 less lumens on the floor standing lamp it might be expensive but i am thinking of getting two more 1600s to put in the upward firing fixtures on the wall unit i will then be able to make the room crazy bright when i want it i will just feel bad because i do not have a place for the two would be retired br30s ,brightness
383,most hue lights have white specific diodes 2 different types for cool and warm whites that are mixed when you choose a mid temperature white the rgb diodes are not actually on when using whites until you move out of the white range and then the rgb diodes are mixed in to tint the overall colour while the white diodes are mixed out as you saturate the colour more it is to do with the cri you can not get the highest crispest quality whites by using just rgb diodes ,color
384,i bet it would fit into ceiling lights that are designed for 75w or 100w fixtures not because such incandescents would have been physically bigger but because they probably need more room around them due to the heat output so it is a matter of matching the correct bulbs and fixtures as usual ,brightness
385,every hue bulb uses zigbee and bluetooth is always the extra that adds demo version capability for people who are not convinced that they would want to upgrade to the full version with the zigbee bridge ,color
386,yeah you are right i guess let there be light ,brightness
387,i have a room with 15 x 20 feet approx with 9600 lumen output from 8 sources i still need to have a few more to have a nice lightning ,brightness
388, most hue lights have white specific diodes 2 different types for cool and warm whites indeed the white only bulbs are the only hue bulbs that do not have the color temperature leds in them  the rgb diodes are not actually on when using whites until you move out of the white range yes they are and you can see that from the light strips as the leds are directly visible all leds are also participating whether you are picking the white shade from the full color or color temperature gamut in case of a neutral white the rgb bunch is compensating by being green at a similar saturation as the cool and warm white leds are bluish and reddish  it is to do with the cri and that is why almost no color changing bulb can be a high cri bulb including philips hue ,color
389,i spent roughly dollar11 50 for each bulb in a 3 pack of nanoleaf a19 800 lumens,brightness
390,i have a room 12x25 with 18500 lumen from 2 sources and i still need a few more lights to get ideal lighting lol ,brightness

495,f lux really has nothing to do with what is being described in the article its purpose is to attempt to alter your display output is white point temperature to resemble that of the combination of sunlight and daylight given the time and approximate latitude the display does not produce monochromatic red output for 12 hours a day f lux has always bugged me for a number of reasons if you work with colour at all you should at a minimum install daylight fluorescent lighting in your workspace e g 6500 k so that colour reproduction is consistent between physical and virtual colour spaces there are also more expensive colour critical luminaires available for proofing design and photographic works although both are usually lower temperature to match more likely lighting scenarios and require suitably enabled colour critical display devices to match their colour temperature television and film related work e g grading is usually done in near or total darkness using crts or expensive tri color backlight screens regardless of industry any colour related work should be done on a monitor that has been calibrated and profiled since f lux almost certainly achieves its effect by altering your display card is gamma lut it would instantly invalidate all of it it is also very important to note that that all native displays on relatively modern apple devices use a cold cathode or led based white backlight that is usually designed to produce light at a colour temperature close to 6500 k so that when calibrated they narrow the colour gamut by the smallest possible amount when you alter the colour temperature of the display output to emulate say 4000 k such as you might do for a sunrise or sunset you dramatically reduce the amount of colours your display will actually produce in the srgb colour space from 16 million to maybe something closer to effectively 10 or 11 million which has the effect of producing banding and other rendering artifacts that can make photographs gradients and other continuous tone graphics look terrible to avoid this problem you have to use a crt or a tri color display backlight that can adjust red green blue backlight intensity independently of one another personally i would stay away from this software but i guess some people think it is a neat idea tl dr install a daylight coloured bulb at your workspace and stick with d65 on your monitor turn your various device screens off as you approach bedtime as any form of light particularly the whitish blue light from computer screens may be detrimental to your mental health and circadian rhythm ,color

499,i just hate to be the anti flux guy but i would like to question people why they use it at all it makes your colors look orange if you need help sleeping then get off the computer meditate read a book flux is not the answer using your computer and attempting to go right to bed is not the best idea for you if you have a problem going to sleep ,color

512,i used red light as my low back light to see in relatively dim environment it was horrible for my mood because when i leave the room into bright light it feels like my eyes would were being pierced by needles after some time i somehow came to the conclusion that blue light is what i need so i got blue lights for my back light and it worked out perfectly dim enough for computer display work can see things around decently enoughl no eye strain pain at all when transitioning to bright environments and there is really no significan not transition to fluorescent incandescent lighting though sunlight is a bit rough on my since i spend so much time in the dark sunglasses are a requirement or taking ibuprofen since it will give me headaches if i do not block out the intensity of the light i can see where they might consider blue a colder more depressing color though i have been thinking about seeing how an amber or purple light would do though i do not feel the blue light really plays a significan not role in my overall mood i have though about trying a more comforting color like amber or purple ,color

522,its all blue lighting in cic and sonar now the blue lighting creates a contrast with the green screens allowing you to see more definition in the old crt screens its still red everywhere else part of the reason why even though everything is switching over to led screens the color scheme on most programs is the traditional green ,color

524,it is not just the blue portion of white light melanopsin is most sensitive to blue light but rods and cones which also mediate light is effects on the circadian clock are most sensitive to green light moreover above a certain intensity wavelength is no longer as important as the response saturates ,others
525,i actually work in the same department at ohio state as a student not under the same pi and can perhaps shed some light on the reasoning behind the behavioral studies which i admit  first you have to understand that depression is a very complicated disorder and there really are no definitive physical measures that we can use to quantify it diagnoses are usually made after a patient complains of lethargy or anhedonia the  you are referencing is effective because it mimics the apathy to pleasure humans experience when they develop depression mice have fairly well developed brains and mice with induced depressive characteristics mimicking those of humans will be less apt to seek pleasurable reinforcement and will respond to antidepressant treatment it is an accepted method that a lab can use in combination with other study including looking at the dendritic spines and while naysayers will always complain of poor translateability to humans animal models are very effective and more efficient in many cases clinical trials should be done eventually only after receiving approval a process that often requires data from animal models but you should still take the discoveries at face value ,others
526,medications do not get typically tested on humans until after they have been through animal trials this may be something similar testing it on animals to see what kind of results they may expect in human trials ,others
527, if research labs can test new and potentially dangerous medications on humans why not pay some people to test the correlation between light and moods generally they cannot if the risk is high to participants such an intervention is considered unethical all human research studies must be approved by an irb any potential benefits to others must be weighed against harm to the individuals participating but with a high degree of risk aversion ,others
528, i am a bit confused by this article it was my understanding that the white blue light lamps were useful for helping people feel happier since those are what they use in the lamps for treating seasonal affective disorder yes but that is during the day if you have bluish light like cold white during the night or actually any light at all but more blue makes it worse it will suppress the production of melatonin which is the so called sleephormone this will fuck up your sleep wake cycle which in longterm can lead to some bullshit like depression or increased risk of alzheimers ,color

530,that will not happen unless it makes people buy more ,others
531,cars with blue dash light drive me crazy who decided to use something that hurts night vision a bit if blue accent can make something stand out but the general color should be red red is also a relatively new color sense we sense red light because our green receptors duplicated and then changed seeing in the red spectrum helps us in a way that was so beneficial that nearly every human has this adaptation without fail excluding red green colorblind folks ,color
532,blue lights have a shorter wave length than red and are easier on the eyes and mood at night my car uses bluish lights for dashboard and are quite soothing at night think about how red light affects your mood think prostitutes and venereal diseases personally i think it is an evolutionary thing that mimics natural light bright sun during the day white light and reddish sunsets at night as the light dims it is related to your sleep time patterns and your overall circadian rhythm think african sunsets and how terrifying the nighttime was for early humans tigers prefer to hunt at night lighting is critical to staging any scene including work places and shopping centers eg walmart possibly everybody could benefit from a change in reddish death lights to something cooler and less stressful ,color

535,as the article says  the study examined the role of specialized photosensitive  that do not have a major role in vision but detect light and send messages to a part of the brain that helps regulate the body is circadian clock follow the link above for a wikipedia article about iprgcs these cells do not usually participate in vision but instead serve regulating things like pupil size and the circadian clock they are most sensitive to blue light it seems to me that the researchers were testing a very logical hypothesis that follows from the facts above the circadian rhythm is most strongly influenced by blue light so in order to have night lights that disturb it the least we need to use the kind of lighting that the iprgcs are least sensitive to with such lighting our rods and cones the vision cells will still detect some light but the influence on the circadian rhythm will be minimal this poses a problem because lighting during night shifts is supposed to keep workers awake as for your question color vision is done by the cones we have three kinds of cones red green and blue if you are red colorblind you do not have red cones because of the way the brain functions if you lack enough rods and cones it could rewire itself to use iprgcs for vision the extent to which this happens may depend on how early in life you lost your rods and cones my wild guess is that if you only lack red cones this will not be enough for the brain to rewire itself so being red colorblind would not have much of an effect red green colorblind well you might have some rewiring which means that the iprgcs may start playing a role in your vision  such as mostly blue light causing blurred halos slowly fading in and out your view this should not cause any change in the way iprgcs affects your circadian rhythm though which means that colorblindness should not affect the results of the study ,color

551,i was looking for something like these i wanted to make multicolor outdoor lighting and control it with an arduino i still can not find a bulb that is cheap or something i can reverse engineer a bit the philips are nice but wireless and expensive ,color
552,blueblockers and maui jims due this as well ,others
553,i have tried those and they do help what works best for me is a blue blocking screen that i attach to my lap top at night flux is also great but it is not enough to keep me from getting insomnia at night ,color
554,you eyes adjust to 3400k just as well ,brightness
555,i only have issues with 3400 when my brightness setting is not 75percent or higher ,brightness
556,you can use your own location if you set the daytime temperature to the nighttime setting ,controller
557,would not purple blue be bad i am not sure if i really understand why this would help either could you explain a little more ,color
558,you can get rgb led lights that can be programmed to do the same thing but they are expensive ,color
559,start with it off at an angle that it looks normal to you then turn on f lux and adjust your settings accordingly after awhile of using it the orangish white it changes to will appear white ,color
560,i am pretty sure photographers and graphic designers know better than to work while running f lux those of us whose jobs only require excel word do not have any of these concerns ,others
561, i am a designer photographer artist so i can not use f lux this is not for me f lux was created by people who care a lot about accuracy in colors we know you want to make sure your colors are perfect so there is an option to disable f lux for 1 hour at a time for example while using photoshop this setting returns your screen to its normal settings in the future we plan to allow automatic disabling of f lux when you launch certain programs f lux is not designed for use during advanced color work but it is fine for layout or html currently we do not recommend running f lux on calibrated systems running windows but we expect to have a solution for this soon  ,color
562,your points may be true but not everyone needs to do colour sensitive work on their computers ,color
563,99 99percent of people do not care about color accuracy f lux just dims your screen colors so night time reading is more pleasant for the eyes that is all ,color
564,it amazes me that you have been downvoted so hard for this all of this info is accurate no matter what color your display is artificial light late at night is going to kill your sleep cycle and play merry hell with your mood there are far more studies than one that suggest this and using humans too not hamsters ,color
565,f lux is exactly what the article is talking about if you have to work at night you should use software like this to reduce the amount of blue and white light your device emits so that your sleep rhythms are less disturbed ,brightness
566,that is sleep deprivation you need to try sleeping 9 hours a night ,controller
567,there is an option to disable it temporarily and making everything more orange is the whole point of the program ,color
568,i like the nice blueish tint my mouse cursor get when you get used to orange plus you can always tweak the nighttime color setting i set it to fluorescent i wonder though if i usually sleep during the day and waste time during night should i set my coordinates to obtain reverse day night effects since it would make sense that as i am getting closer to going to bed my screen would gradually become darker not the opposite ,color
569,f lux is an app which adjusts the color of your screen during nighttime hours to reduce stress on your eyes and psyche ,color
570,so what if you avoid blue light in the day and red light in the night ,color
571,you should live in another part of the world that matches your rhythm ,others
572,maybe it would help to control your light conditions really well make sure you are exposed to bright light from the moment you wake up until sunset one of those full spectrum therapy lamps might help if real sunlight is not an option moving the sleep schedule back is pretty unpleasant even without a disorder i have to go to pretty extreme measures sometimes ,brightness
573,i know your pain i am 38 and have fought dsps all my life running out of ideas other than getting a night job and fully giving up on my past effort and career ,others
574, in some bad ass command center missile room is a mood now ,controller
575,your right but i i am sure you know what i meant it is just for special effect not to try and make me happy through science ,others
576,yes it is i just want to know if it is bad for my eyes ,others
577,i am curious would you share a pic of that setup ,others
578,i think firemen and ems workers have bigger priorities given people may be dying and all ,others
579,i read somewhere that the reason that hospitals were traditionally painted a light green colour was that when doctors and nurses were concentrating on something red like an open patient and needed to look away for a while to let their eyesight readjust the after image appeared green and looking at a wall that actually was green allowed the readjustment to happen quicker thus allowing them to return to fiddling about inside the patient quicker ,color
580,the interior of the u s s constitution was painted red so that the blood would not show up during battle and panic the sailors as much that is what i remember from the grade school field trip i went on to see it anyway ,color
581,we have patient controlled coloring in all of our peds and peds ed rooms i am actually not sure if our other newer rooms have it too one floor of the hospital has a lobby with ambient changing led colors it is weird to see it changing at night to me it always looks like a disco of illness ,color
582,just chiming in to say that i worked night shift for several years and these are the same glasses that i used and  to other night shifters best dollar8 i have ever spent ,others
583,fyi yellow tinted glasses exist they are used by drivers and they help with eye strain on long journeys ,color
584,pretty sure it happened before then a ways ,others
585,perhaps i will not next time ,others
586,perhaps you should consider that much like the previous millennia of language evolution the meaning of the phrase is not the same as it used to be and correcting people on an incredibly common and perfectly valid use of the phrase just makes you look like a smug asshole ,others
587,blue lights are better for treating depression red lights are better for letting you get tired so you can sleep at odd hours it all depends on the intention and the time of day that you are using the light ,color
588,why is that ,others
589,that is true red light is used because your eyes do not adjust for it ,color
590,i agree about the sensitivity to green but i have not seen anything that suggest green affect circadian rhythm ,color
591,makes sense i never even knew rats had mood disorders o,others
592,some people say insomnia lessens depression but then being sleep deprived also sucks ,others
593,wow thanks for the detailed reply here i did not know that there was a difference between normal and atypical depression cheers for the links it is made for some good reading ,others
594,that is who he is often compared to ,others
595,no i was more asking if certain moods are impossible for me to feel because i can never see the color that was supposed to trigger that mood ,color
596,electric tape ,brightness
597,check that your coordinate settings are entered correctly it bases the timing on your lat long so it shoud not be off ,controller
598,lux it is great can be set to change the brightness depending on the ambient light brightens when you are out in the sun dims turns more red when you are in a dark room at night ,brightness
599,i was going to say this so i will give a protip for android 4 3 users you can setup easyeyes to work on a schedule location or set time based and then open system settings on the app settings apps or hit recents then long press easyeyes and turn off notifications for the app now you never think about it or hear from the app again it just works  also the app lux does all this and you can turn off its status bar alert also but i could not get it to behave consistently you might have more luck protect your eyes ,others
600,problem is i do not know what color multipliers are ,color
601,hell yes and you can sometimes set those up as toggle buttons on the main screen to swap around colors ,color
602,your simple thank you managed to baffle a half dozen redditors and start a bitcoin flame war  those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time but that we are powerless to prevent it ,others
603, on jailbroken iphones since reading your reply a whole two minutes ago i have wandered around google looking for an app that does not require jailbreaking and have not yet found one additionally found no iphone alternatives so you may be out of luck if you are avoiding jailbreaking your phone ,others
604,i feel like i should say something since i spent a semester studying the effect of darkness on drosophila circadian rythym and lifespan but all i really want to do is murder every last fruit fly ,others
605,its more white balance play than really changing things to proper red its red er but not really red it would need to basically be a red pass filter kind of deal to suffice for the goal i was pointing out and it would be more useful for me at least on a phone checking things in the middle of the night without blinding yourself ,color
606,flux messed up my color scheme now every screen is blu ish i disabled flux but everything is still blu ish that will teach me to listen to reddit how do i turn everything back to default white ,color
607,anybody with eyes ,others
608,i guess i am like that i look forward to sun up ,brightness
609, though sadly they patented the most unavoidably obvious way of mixing colors with leds pwm so basically no one gets to make custom colored led devices without paying them ,color
610,if you have more examples handy i want to hear them ,others
611,they are not they are sold through the apple store but i use the android app they also have a generic web interface ,others
612,i like 3400k even though i have no idea what that means for most things but 3800 is better for like gaming and things i guess ,others
613,not if you get them from ikea they are called dioder i believe ,color
614,likewise amazingly it turns out you can actually switch off f lux whenever you want ,brightness
615,i have designed plenty of stuff in grayscale with flux if i do not have a color scheme yet then just turn it off when i start coloring nbd ,color
616,that comment states that it is not for people working with colors i used to ba an f lux user but forgetting to hit the disble button has caused me to redo a lot of work personally i just have light in the room so my eyes do not tire for people who do not care about color and sits in the dark it works great ,color
617, whoosh ,brightness
618,i got one of those really expensive sunrise light alarm clocks and it helps a fair amount my psychiatrist had prescribed a special light but my insurance denied it and i am not about to buy what is basically a dollar500 lamp ,brightness
619,go live in a different part of the world,others
620,yes he is describing how he feels in that room if it makes him feel like he is in a command center than that is different than what he feels in a run down single apartment ,controller
621,those kind of places are often depicted as important significan not so he wants to make himself feel more badass my personal moment of zen at work is when i step off the ambulance and start assessing the situation makes me feel really badass important,others
622,that is my only mood motherfucker ,controller
623,red light is lower level then blue light so less damaging ,color
624,i think the thing that is really damaging to your eyes is the sudden change in brightness when you look away from your screen and into a dark room i heard it tires the muscles in your eyes because it has to keep dilating and shrinking your pupils i am no scientist though and this is just what i have heard ,brightness
625,why would they need to let their eyesight readjust if they were going back to the task that needed that adjusted eyesight i think hygiene concerns making sure all blood is cleaned up would reduce this to a side benefit anyway ,others
626,definitely need to give this a try i had a feeling that seeing daylight after i finished work really fucked with my daytime sleep ,brightness
627,i have been a shift worker for over a decade now and it is killing me as you know midnights are getting to be unbearable and i am a zombie for days afterwards any other recommendations ,others
628,orange glasses best money i have ever spent that and my morning sad lamp seriously ,color
629,gotta get the polarized brown orange or red i have a pair of sunglasses from zeal that have a brownish red polarized lens and it makes everything look like eye candy,color
630,there is a large scientific literature on this topic e g  ,controller
631,i have to admit i did not read the link sorry but i work in the field so i felt i could jump in ,others
632,you probably learn to associate the color seen with that mood sorta related i took sign language in college and one of the deaf teachers said deaf people do not make the smacking noise when kissing to me a kiss does not work without the sound but since they have never heard it they do not even need it ,color
633,how would you feel about a patch to adjust color temperature based on screen brightness when automatic brightness is enabled ,brightness
634,there will not be any alternatives either as apple will not let apps access the functions necessary to modify screen colors outside of the app ,color
635,thank you d now i just need to get to the place where i am ok spending dollar50 on a lightbulb and i am definitely getting one  ,brightness
636,this man speaks the truth heh blue blast that is a good name for it ,color
637,i have these things all over my house i love ikea unfortunately they die kinda quickly i have a few of the led strips that you can change colors and about half the leds on one of the strips stopped working ,color
638,some people need a solid 9 every night and often people listen to the average hours and do not pay attention to their individual needs ,others
639,i thought it was a joke about semantics in some bad ass command center missile room is certainly a mood in a general sense everyone disagreeing with u thejunkyard is using mood in this sense but u thejunkyard is initial question and u pandabearxtream is top level comment uses the word mood in the sense that the article is using which is the physiological mood that is affected by the sync ness or out of sync ness of your circadian rhythm  pandabear is saying it has nothing to do with physiology and circadian rhythm but i like feeling like being in a bad ass command center u aureality is saying but feeling like being in a bad ass command center is a mood then thejunkyard is saying or i thought was jokingly saying so feeling like being in a bad ass command center is now caused by the physiological state of your circadian rhythm qed,controller
640,indeed but in a command centre still is not a mood sure it could affect his mood but then so could literally everything else that happens to him ,others
641,i think op was trying to say that the lights do not have a direct effect on his mood as described in the article but rather just give him the illusion of being in a different situation ,others
642,its not about the location in the spectrum it is about the actual brightness a red light can be as damaging as a green depending ,brightness
643,you are but the officer that just saw his mate blown to bits by a 100mm round is not ,others
644,i would usually just put them on in the mornings sometimes i would just pop them on while i was leaving work in the morning i was usually pretty okay as long as i did not expose myself to sunlight without them before it was time to sleep if your girlfriend works under bright lights or something she might want to put the orange glasses on a couple hours before her intended bedtime ,color
645,weird i am the opposite way pretty much been much happier better rested since moving to night shift around a year ago ,others
646,jesus christ marie ,brightness
647,thanks,controller
648,i technically would not feel any way about it i am using a hacked nook that does not do automatic brightness sounds like it would be pretty awesome to allow that though ,brightness
649,it may be in one of the newer releases have you updated recently i noticed i do not have it on my pc have not updated in forever but i do on my mac ,others
650,i have never heard of bcm the bcms i found body control modules do control leds but use pwm if it is something else like a technique can you use it on an arduino or get drivers comparable to tlc5940s that use it ,controller
651,actually dollar200 lol you need to buy the base station first that plugs into your router and it comes with 3 bulbs ,others
652,dude when i turn off f lux on my ipad i can feel my eyes screaming in agony and setting themselves on fire ,brightness
653,hmmm that is odd how long have you had them i have some that have been running nearly constantly for over 2 years and my father has some that have been up for 5 years none of those have died in the slightest maybe you got some defective ones ours never move either do you mess with them a lot ,others
654,not with that orange flux software you do not ,color
655,i know for myself that i can do 7 min any more then 8 makes me tired as well ,controller
656,now if you spent as much effort on your actual essays you would be going somewhere ,others
657,key word like he has the same mood as he would theoretically have in a command centre ,controller
658,and the creation of said illusion is used to inspire a different mood from what the room would normally give off ,others
659,could be ,others
660,just updated still no candle lowest is halogen at 3400k,brightness
661,i have had them about 2 years leds started dying in that strip after about a year the others i have are still fine and were bought at the same time,others
662,how would you know ,others
663,not college but somewhere wait no bullshitting on essays is exactly what gets you into college ,others
664,feeling as though you are in a certain place is not the same thing as mood you have conflating the two uses of the word feeling i could not say that my mood was feeling like i am in mcdonalds ,others
665,where is that hidden at i am on a few week old build and i am not seeing it ,others
666,huh i have got no clue then ,others
667,ohhh so essentially the same idea as pwm but not quite as flexible interesting idea thanks for those ,others
668,to reduce the flickering why not put a capacitor in the led circuit ,controller
669, of it i am not going to cite specific led control patents because they have loads of them many looking almost the same ,controller
670,hmmm sounds like a defect i feel like ikea is the kind of company that would replace that even after that long leds are not supposed to die ever ,others
671,because i have used it and it makes everything orange ,color
672,that still implies a mood whether it is hungry or disgusted or whatever people feel inside a mcdonald is it is an invoked mood ,others
673,okay i can accept that but surely then everything is a mood everything one does or experiences affects one is mood to some degree does not it ,others
674,sure and it is hardly the most earth shatteringly important distinction either but if one can not argue in favour of logical correctness in a science subreddit where can one ,others
675,you want me to find you a study of staring at led lights in a desk for an extended period of time damages your eyes long exposure to a light source at close proximities is not good for your eyes would you stare at a lamp for 4 5 hours no it would make your eyes and probably your head hurt pretty bad the obnoxious leds i am talking about are not as bright as a 100w light bulb but they are not something you should be staring at for extended periods of time ,brightness
676,do not most of us suffer a 9 5 or equivalent job seriously though you could be right ,others
677,damn nope i think i know where it used to be hidden in cm10 but they hid a bunch of stuff recently the more advanced settings ,others
678,are you being obtuse on purpose the command center feeling he describes makes him feel a certain way which certainly affects his mood which is why he prefers it because it makes him feel a certain way which is his mood if you did not like to be outside because it made you feel like you were in a boiling cauldron it would certainly mean your mood is fucked as well hence the usage of the word like how do you function in the real world with such a fucked up sense of logic and that level of reading comprehension you have no foot to stand on with your logic and you have no premise to continue this conversation ,controller
679, but surely by that standard everything implies a mood pretty much some places will need more context then others to accurately convey a particular mood or feeling though ,others
680,that is kinda what i do too minus the get up and dick around i am a miserable zombie it is really no fun you have got it good enjoy it ,others
681,paypal has a ton of other problems and is a shitty company in general so i avoid using it but i generally agree with you bitcoin is still too volatile right now ,others
682, it would not i would be bored out of my mind and it would produce an afterimage but a typical lamp is not going to make my head hurt we are not talking about staring at the sun here tried it when i was kid i noticed that when i looked at bright lights and then looked away i could see an effect where the light was i stared at a light for about 2 minutes and got a headache i have no info other than that but i would not recommend looking at bright leds all day anyway though i have been staring at a crt screen for a few hours a day for the past 3 4 years of my life and my eyes feel fine so ,brightness
683,sorry i do not recognize you all youtubers trying to monetize off of reddit with no content look the same to me ,others
684,you again lol merry christmas to you too and have a joy filled holiday season ,others
685,judging by the content of your responses here on reddit it is very apparent how lonely and self conscious you are i am really sorry your life is as stale as it comes and you have no friends or joy to cherish this christmas season i really hope 2020 is better for you and your troll outlook on reddit of trashing topics calling people is names and just being straight up a negative nancy changes life is precious my friend it takes more effort to flame someone on reddit than to say something nice hope you pay it forward kindness is still a thing ,others
686,you have hit the nail in the head there the premium price is not just on the packaging but on the integration and also the value you get from the endless options on colors and settings if you want white you got white if you want colored you got colored no more buying endless strands of christmas trees only to have them all be a particular color break lights lose bulbs etc still think the price is steep but this is a product i was pleased with and hope the durability sticks and the quality on the software continues to improve if you have not please consider subscribing to my channel for similar content of tech reviews home automation and smart tech really appreciate it admz8 ,color
687,they are literally lumps of salt they are not magic they do however emit a lovely glow and look very nice edit and they do taste like salt if you lick them my so did this as soon as i opened the box ,brightness
688,i have one i find it great for sexy time because the glow gives enough light to see but not enough to see unwanted detail ,brightness
689,my mom uses one when she meditates and she loves it it is a lovely glow and definitely gives the room a very warm peaceful look to it ,brightness
690,my office has like 3 they make zero difference ,others
691,my mom who is on oxygen got one as a gift she insisted on getting rid of it because the instructions warned not to use it if you are on oxygen anyone else have this in their instructions ,others
692,i do not know of any benefits other than light they are supposed to give but my sister has an orangey pink one and it is pretty ,brightness
693,to me with severe anxiety and ptsd they are very calming i like sitting near it is light it is soothing in the same way a candle is but it is as beneficial to your health as a candle too lol so if you buy one realize it is just a fancy little lamp ,brightness
694,do we share a so when i bought my boyfriend one for christmas the first thing he did was lick it ,others
695,you might have just convinced me to buy one my fianc always has the brightest lights on in our room i tell him all the time they kill the sexy ,brightness
696,thank you this was very helpful ,others
697,not to be nitpicking or in your face but there is very little solid science behind the article you read and i am pretty sure that ions cannot cause the effects claimed above even if they could they cannot be absorbed by the body in their ionised form ,others
698,i guess that is why science is always expanding ,others
699,i used the faq from their page to add another profile so we can share control over it ,others
700,thanks for the heads up been tracking this for months just bought the black floor lamp ,color
701,finally nabbed two black floor lamps that i have been eyeing for quite some time stoked to finally get them in and finish the setup i have been working on,color
702,i think there is more flexibility with these biggest examples being they can produce multiple colors at once and the colors are diffused ,color
703,i am not sure if this is isold out since it showed the same message of temporarily out of stock before it was even in stock today it could be they just never added the stock philips hue has the stock count deep within the code of the site here are the current stock  black table lamp 320 left black floor lamp 122 left white table lamp 6 left,color
704,omg where did you find the stock count this is amazing i would love to use this in the future ,others
705,awesome i ordered a ruby one today that will ship 4 20 can not wait to get it ,color
706,all of this ,others
707,thank you very much for your thorough review however i would very much like to hear your personal opinion on what you deem to be the best pick from each category ,others
708,thank you would you recommend the blue for sad i an looking for something portable to treat it and find it hard to use the lights and for it into my schedule ,color
709,yes blue light is a tad better than green especially for mood changes so yes for sad blue light is likely to be preferred luminette should work just fine and there is at least one study showing the luminette is effective for sad see these 2 studies where a luminette 1st study but unnamed because the luminette was not yet on sale it went on sale on the year of publication of this study we can check it is the luminette because it is emitting at 468nm exactly the same wavelength as luminette or luminette like glasses 2nd study were used  more studies about the luminette can be found here  and also on pubmed and scholar google com,color
710,i really like it i use it all the time yes it is expensive yes it is kinda pointless but if tech and flashy lights it is your thing then you are well away maybe do not buy it straight away casually save for it if you still want it in 6 months you have saved enough for it and may find it cheaper as well ,brightness
711,wait on that some people love the box some do not and at that price for what you are going for it is not worth it  you need some aps the color change feature you are asking about can be controlled through any number of apps for different effects and moods ,color
712,it really depends on the use for you at this point i use it daily for tv gaming and the occasional mood light for relaxing or gatherings not so much lately i love it and would not give it up that said it is a complicated device and requires patience for the majority of people this is not a plug and play situation in my estimation so if you are going to buy it you need to be really intentional on the use and which bulbs you plan on using it took me many weeks to get it as close to perfect as i could and i have many years of bias lighting hobby ing under my belt to answer your question it is worth it if you are going to make the most of it if your lighting needs are a once and a while situation the cost and attention required may not even out ,others
713,i do not have it but i have been looking at it my conclusion is that when i upgrade my tv i will get one a philips ambilight tv instead and try it out apparently it is much better and you can add it to hue stuff and i am not sure i am willing set everything up manually for a less than great experience ,color
714,it sound is like you have answered your own question play bar 550 dollargbp60 signe 1000 lm dollargbp150 hue beyond table lamp 600lm gbpdollar250 hue beyond ceiling 1200lm gbpdollar400 normal hue bulb 800lm gbpdollar40  if you have the money get the signe looks better than the play bar when upright do wish they have mae the whole thing one material the white with the black back looks awful up right  signe is nice i have a few in the lounge ,color
715,thank you so much for the detailed response the explanation on why the brighter light is not always the clear winner in this case makes a lot of sense i also agree that the appeal of the play bar is that you can easily hide even 3 of them behind the tv and at the same time keep a very clean and simple look for your entertainment area i think i am leaning toward the play bars now as the signe would not really provide a clear advantage for the higher price unless you just really love the aesthetic i feel like the signe might fit better lighting a corner with some plants rather then near the tv ,brightness
716,appreciate the good right up i went ahead and bought the hue light start kit with 4 bulbs cause best buy was giving away 2 evho dots depending on my experience i will probably stick with hue their prices have come down dramatically from when they first hit the market and i originally looked at them ,color
717,dude thanks this worked like a charm it was not obvious when i opened the packaging that i would be able to do it you saved me there are some kinks like i will ask alexa to turn the light strip purple and it will say ok but no changes it still works with colors like red but that is minor thanks,color
718,does harmony work with alexa as a skill or device ,others
719,i do not think those are the ones he she got i just bought the small space kit you linked to actually i bought two of them it is the kit that comes with a fancy looking remote control with color wheel one light bulb and one light strip at dollar14 88 it is a pretty sweet deal except that i do not think it can be configured to be controlled by a smartphone alexa homekit or google assistant the instructions make no mention of it being controllable by these things unlike this dollar12 88 monster light strip that walmart also sells light strip only no remote but photo on the box mentions wi fi and smartphone controllable before i ran out to my local walmart to search for and buy the small space kit i had done some googling and youtube searching and found no mention of it being controllable by a smartphone except this thread here i took a chance and played around but could not get it working some additional notes  the smart life and monster iphone apps give some goofy instructions for putting the lights in pairing mode whereby you plug in the lights unplug them plug them in again and repeat once or twice more and the lights should start blinking i could not get my small space kit is light strip to ever start blinking by following those instructions the instructions that come with the small space kit make no mention of smartphone capabilities but do give instructions for pairing and unpairing with their remote control i was able to un pair the light strip which caused it to blink a couple of times but then the light just went solid so if there is a way to get it into a constant blinking mode i am not sure how i would not be surprised if this kit and the other one are using completely different underlying technologies that are not compatible with one another it is really too bad that monster did not take these a step further and give them smartphone functionality because the price is fantastic searching walmart is website i see several products light strips and bulbs that use this new remote control system a couple of light strips that use some other credit card sized remote and just that one other light strip that i linked to above that touts smartphone capabilities i do not see any bulbs mentioning smartphone controllability at this point i may hold onto them for another week just in case someone else finds a hidden feature but i may end up buying that dollar12 88 light strip because even that is a good price for a smartphone alexa controllable light strip ,others
720,epl has a few too ,others
721,this is good to know i have been trying to find a good blue light lamp i have to add vitamin d in the winter to my daily medication regimen but if this works as well as you say and i do office work so it would be incredibly easy to have it shine in my eyes consistently for a while i will have to look into getting one sad hits me like a freight train every year without fail ,brightness
722,i use rgb strip lighting yeelight in my bedroom largely so i can simulate sunsets when i get into bed it is great for winding down and sunrises which i use in place of an alarm in the mornings i played around with colours when i first got them but over time they are pretty much always on the same warm white setting though i do play around with the brightness ,brightness
723,yeelight does have some cool light gadgets but it is not that well know right i also have used some products from this company rgb strip is in my opinion more suitable to use in gaming room while playing games or living room while watching movie or have home party it is indeed not a common way to adjust colors in the bedroom haha thanks for your comment ,color
724, but smart switches might have some limitations it might be better to have more advanced features such us app control set timer work with other smart devices etc which is what smart bulbs or other smart light gadgets can achieve if the switches are truly smart then they should be capable of all of that anyway effectively the only reason to have a physical switch involved is because there is no sensor suitable for determining when it is needed it is not needed on a set routine and some users are uncomfortable using voice assistants and or phones i suspect that as we move forward there will be a generational shift in how we approach lighting for older generations used to having whatever bulb was available at the local shop in whatever colour temperature the tungsten filament burned at the idea of coloured lighting in various spaces is somewhat alien the best they could hope for was a dimmer and using furnishings to provide colour for younger generations moving forward i suspect we will see more neutral decor but more use of colour selectable lighting distributed around the room as opposed to a few point sources in the more traditional model think light strips along the bottom and top of walls localised lighting to working areas i e kitchen worktops desk lamps etc we are already seeing some of these shifts begin to happen even without everything being rgb w due to a much greater understanding of for want of a better term the ergonomics of lighting and availability of suitable technologies namely led compact and low voltage does not require high power cable runs everywhere  as for me my ideal would be both smart switches have no way of controlling colour or even white balance temperature making me inclined to use smart bulbs but smart bulbs are incompatible with other users of my household who have decades of hit the switch on the way out drummed into their heads effectively i just need a button they can hit to trigger the smart bulb but preferably one that does not cost a kidney and sometimes asking alexa involves alexa deciding to ask you a stupid question loud enough to wake the dead ,color
725,very detailed and experienced answer appreciated it the main reason is that we are in a middle stage where new devices need to consider the compatibility of old ones and it will lead to some function limitations eg color hue cannot be adjusted in the future with all devices becoming more advanced we should be able to see some really interesting things on the market implemented with 5g ai iot cloud computing making our whole life smarter but now we still have a long way to achieve truly smart lighting in home what would be your expectation about that ,color
726,i know everyone hates on hue for being so expensive but their shit just works consistently i have philips hue bulbs throughout my apartment and have convinced my parents to get them as well not a single issue with them ever and i have used them with homekit and google home together and separately a lot of people like the lifx bulbs and i will say they are brighter than hue but less consistent in my experience even being 20 feet away from the router they had issues at times where hue has never had an issue i think they look really good and their color saturation was amazing but could not get over the inconsistency when i say to siri google to turn on a light i expect it to turn on i have also seen people have some success with the tp link kasa smart bulbs as well i have no experience with them but a friend of mine has reported no issues with them be careful with cheap bulbs on amazon 9 10 times you will get a bulb that reports back to china through your network and trust me network security is more important than saving dollar20 per bulb i have a friend that had cheap bulbs he got and immediately found they were sending pings back to a server in china so has taken them out let me know if you have any questions ,brightness
727,philips hue in my opinion this is the easiest way to go ,color
728,i went for a hue starter pack with color bulbs on black friday about 2 years ago and i have been buying hue since then today i have around 70 hue products in my home and there is only a handful of dumb lamps left to be replaced in the future my experience of hue is great the most important should be reliability and security and that is something hue can offer it is great that it works internally on my own lan even if i am offline and the response time is fast eventhough my wlan sucks the hub that is connected by wire will work better as opposed to some alternatives that do not use a hub something else that very few people mentions is the availability of the products because the brand is so popular you will be guaranteed to have support updates and new products in the future i mean even the stores where i get my groceries have hue ,color
729,i have the tp link kasa smart light bulb the dimmable one but i think they do colours too,color
730, be careful with cheap bulbs on amazon 9 10 times you will get a bulb that reports back to china through your network and trust me network security is more important than saving dollar20 per bulb and then you think well hey i will buy these sylvania smart color smart bulbs because sylvania is a good ol company right and so you buy some and they work ok and so you buy more only the original ones start dying and now you have bought 16 sylvania bulbs and a year and a half later only half of them still work ,color
731,fair points and i had the same concerns about reliability and security is the philips wiz a good middle ground then philips hue really only benefits you if you have more than one bulb and want a synced system right i just need one that will slowly brighten in the morning as my alarm clock ,brightness
732,two years in and my hue bulbs are still kicking just saying ,color
733,oh for sure i have 15 or so hue bulbs in addition to some motion sensors blooms etc the hue stuff is solid and i have had precisely 0 issues i just thought maybe i can cheap out a bit and put color bulbs in a bunch more lighting fixtures turns out i can but they do not last ,color
734,the latest generation of philips hue bulbs also have bluetooth so a hub is not needed for only a couple bulbs this will probably be your best bet if you want reliable and just a single bulb just note that the white hue bulbs only dim they do not change colour temperature ,color
735,listen to this guy he knows what is up i did not know the new bulbs were bluetooth and hub capable thanks for the info ,others
736,definitely not the fixtures and definitely not just me if you read the reviews on amazon this is a pretty widespread issue,others
737,i have it for my basement the tradfri line is ok the price is great i highly suggest getting the hub and not integrating into a hue hub too many drop offs would i do a whole house in it no would i continue to use them in less used spaces around the house absolutely the whites are not as accurate as hue but good enough the color spectrum is meh and control is trash in the app i just use homekit if you cared about those models ,color
738,worth it but use a hue hub,color
739,more watts less money i hate dark ,color
740,i have 4x in my living room we do not need a bright lights in there we use it to relax at the end of the day i found them to be great at the price we do not have a lot of local choice here i need to buy all my smart home products from china via aliexpress due to the current situation i felt like i needed some bulbs for my home office and bought 2 white tradfri for the recessed downlighter in the ceiling i set them up just yesterday to enter pairing mode i use a table lamp and was really disappointed they really do not have the power for a darker environment where brighter lights are required i use a raspbee bridge you might want to check it you can use ikea bulbs hue gledopto bulbs i think any zigbee bulbs and combine them with pretty much any zigbee sensor or smart plug if you go the route of the hue hub i think im right in saying you can only go down the route of using hue sensors ,brightness
741,i picked up most of mine from the ikea ding and dent section so the price was right on the bad side the motion sensors and round dimmers are absolute useless junk same with the app the colored bulbs will not do any color just a pre selected pallet even in home kit where you have a color wheel to pick it will cog to the next preset the good is that they work well nice and bright warm whites if we do not have our phones we just turn the manual switch off and back on again to trigger the light back to it is last scene homekit is where it is at for us we generally have our phones with us i really wish i could rename siri i would love to be able to walk in and say computer lights ,brightness
742,i have hue in living room white ambiance no colors they are great except for the price in home office i have tradfri they have narrower brightness range hue can go darker bit that would be fine but sokething crashes at least once a week i second investing in hue,color
743,chandelier screw end e14 ,brightness
744,i am kinda late to this discussion but how exactly do they integrate with your smart things hub do you still need the tr dfri driver ,others
745,that is my plan all overhead lights and mounted lights will be this and use hue for lamps and colour splashes just did not want to pull the plug without some reviews youtube seems to be lacking on these ,color
746,that sounds right could not remember the actual designation mine are not regular bulb with an e14 end mine are chandelier bulbs with e14 bases,others
747, partly because the whole blue green cold white spectra is mostly useless if you have a fancier color bulb you will prolly still only end up using the warmer side of white red possibly magenta pink ,color
748,unless you have a toddler alexa is constantly changing all the lights in the house to green then blue then magenta then red then purple at least he is learning his colors ,color
749,the production on this album is insane it is so ambitious and not afraid to go the extra mile and be the best version of itself my brain just turned to mush over the past 37 minutes so much of it sounds different from what i was expecting and also sounds different from what they sounded like live i found it in u sounds so different i feel energy is just as good but draws from different places sounds for its power zombie conqueror is nuts fuckin nuts also we now have confirmation that the 3 new ladies in the lineup are not on this album all of the uncredited vocals were dave even when it did not sound like it i think,controller
750,going for my fifth spin loving it this is how i hoped the follow up to swing lo would sound like dave is definitely rejuvenated glad to have nat baldwin on board again the new band sounds great favorite song i feel energy  i love when dave throws this kind of curveball a song sort of reminds you to other songs but has a characteristic dp sound highlights right now break thru zombie conqueror found it in you and i wanna feel it all lowlights i really do not care for you are the one can not wait for my physical copy of the album to arrive i want to dig into the lyrics and credits ,others
751,i have listened about 6 times by now and i am loving it i love how rewarding it is to listen for the intricacies of the production and the details that get glossed over when first listening to an album those sonic goodies if you will lol i feel that is something that dave has mastered over these last two records i like how he uses the piano as a sort of glossy texture i also like how minimal the bass is for whatever reason my favorite song right now is zombie conquerer it is hard af and feels so intense when the chorus comes in i also especially love you are the one feel it all and that is a lifestyle my least favorite is actually i feel energy it is energetic but i think i am just not inclined to like the timbres of that song and it feels busy it reminds me of wanna be starting something though which is cool i also feel like this is a good companion piece to the last album which i also love it is like the opposite side of the same coin but with guitar this time ,brightness
752,a few listens in and i am loving this album for me the standout is definitely what is the time has elements of gospel soul thrown in and makes for a song i love listening to that is a lifestyle sounds to me like the closest thing to parts of swing lo and i dig it albeit with less self reflection and more societal critique lyrically also really love bluebird to be honest i can not really complain strongly about anything on this album you are the one seems a bit different but i can see why it is in there and it serves as a bit of a transition for i wanna feel it all with the possible exception of the last two songs it sounds like an album written by someone just generally high on life love it as said by another commenter dave sounds rejuvenated ,brightness
753,i have been paying attention to this band to varying degrees for a long time now but last year is self titled album and now lamp lit prose are what have really sucked me in i love the blend of contemporary pop production with dave is bombastic but sharply focused songwriting singing guitar playing the horns the rhythms and polyrhythms etc the tonal shift fast follow up between dp and llp blows my mind it somehow still feels like a direct sequel sonically but with a completely different mood vibe i am hooked this is my first post on this subreddit hi ,brightness
754,after having listened to llp on a loop for 5 days i have got better formulated thoughts i have far more compliments than criticism and so for the sake of time here are my criticisms compliments to follow soon right now do not really get this song find it mildly irritating the chorus is so tame the guitar is mixed too highly the horns are a lil naff the production feels the least self sure or least fulfilled on the record and that keyboard solo at the end is weak i hate that the girls sing conq you rer on zombie conquerer that songs definitely a grower wasnt sure at first but that one pronunciation really bugs me  the way dave sings rad at the end of i found it in u is soooooo cringeworthy that aside it is one of the best tracks that will do for now gushing praise to follow ,brightness
755,you are an amazing poster around here and from now on any of these big posts you make will be made into a current announcement thanks for being a great member of the community and keep the discussion up ,others
756, direct sequel sonically i totally agree it is the horns that really sell it up in hudson was my gateway into dp so i love that he is exploring that sound more ,controller
757, i hate that the girls sing conq you rer on zombie conquerer i love it part of me thinks david told her to do that just because he sings it that way live too ,controller
758,much appreciated i love writing them and reading everyone is thoughts ,others
759,right so here is my take on the timelime around llp past future dave made this record with just nat and mike the guest vocalists and then found three female vocalists to keep the same stage setup that they have had this gives him a chance to work with the new girls for a while and get to know their voices and musical abilities and the next album will involve them more ,others
760,wow dave is a god did any of the new touring members get credited for anything on the album or were all the additional vocal parts done by the guest features ,others
761,the new band are not on the album mike johnson is on a number of tracks and nat baldwin is on two i think all vocals are done by himself and guests although even the guest spots are minimal ,others
762,haha i do the same on my band is albums in terms of recording most of the instrumentation other than the drums myself then having a separate live lineup ,others
763,currently converting the kcrw session to mp3s will post soon,controller
764,i am disappointed from the title i was expecting a tron lightcycle that would transform into an autobot and for dollar650 it really should ,brightness
765,so you are telling me i could get either really direct harsh lighting or really uselessly diffused lighting in a form that has all the charm of an automotive paint robot for only dollar650 dollar850 where do i sign up ,others
766,it does not look that great to me can wealthy people not just afford better lighting built into their home why would i need this would anyone even notice it unless i point it out that i spent this much on a lamp it is not something flashy enough to brag about nor useful enough to break any new ground worth bragging about the vacuums and fans are unique enough but this does not really seem like a bright idea,others
767,well this is one heck of an ad,brightness
768,are the socks intentional so confused ,others
769,let is see in 60 years how they really hold up it is a bold claim and i do not believe them ,others
770,is not thomas edison is original lightbulb still working due to the thickness of the filament ,brightness
771,i made a light like this a couple of years ago for a totally different purpose made a 6 foot version for outside lighting and 1 foot version solo led source and costs under dollar100 to make ,others
772,what i want to know is why she is wearing different colored socks ,color
773,dyson lets put a blade in the base of the fan and call it bladeless lets put a light in the base of a lamp too and call it revolutionary i will admit their vacuums are really good tho ,brightness
774,the ceo of dyson suckered me in to buying his shitty ass vacuum cleaner by saying i just believe things should work properly in his european accent my dumb american brain was like yeah he sounds smart and that is common sense then i proceeded to buy and return 5 of them over the course of 3 years as they constantly broke until i realized wait these are pieces of shit first time marketing worked on me never again  ,controller
775,since versatility seems to be its main selling point i was expecting it to be wireless and therefore easily movable with crazy battery life that you recharge once a month in an hour or less nope it is a wired lamp that swivels could probably just buy an led bulb for your existing swivel lamp ,others
776,so r gadgets is basically just ads huh ,others
777,this is the apple pro stand of lamps ,brightness
778,ugh i can make that with home depot parts and an led you might have to change the led once but i will do it for dollar125 or less stupid ,others

780,what an overpriced piece of shit just like all their products ,others
781,way out of my price range all my lamps are ikea i think it is pretty cool though ,others

784,okay but for dollar650 could not they have made it less fucking ugly ,others

787,cool it is not dollar650 cool though ,others
788,i do not get it ,others
789,it does change into a lot of different configurations based on the video and it does last 60 years but i would think half that cost would be more acceptable but i still would not buy it unless i became very rich ,others

791,wait so it is a lamp that swivels in multiple areas is that it ,others
792,wife wants to know if dyson makes a vibrator ,others
793,what gets me is this can function as several different types of lamp but it is actually s o much  less  convenient than just having 3 different lamps and for the price of course you could get at least 30 ,others
794,i saw this at best buy the other day it is really nothing special absolute waste of money ,others

814,now now i am getting a lot of sarcasm here you are forgetting you also get a usb c charging port ,others
815,it is a reach reminds me of the hair dryer but keep in mind some people who care way more about their hair than i do swear by those when the fans came out people said the exact same as you but it was just vacuums a version or two later it was quieter and a little cheaper and i think they have done well i have a couple and they really are somewhat nicer than equivalent fans i have from other brands i hate minor rattles and squeaks and they mostly do not have them trick is they are 20percent nicer for 4x cost depending on your budget and needs that may or may not matter it did not to me the light will probably be the same it will be a question of whether the value add is enough to make it attractive to larger budgets or niche needs ,others
816, bright idea i see what you did there ,brightness
817,rich people need to have something absurd like this as more of a display piece so they can point to it and say  see how little money means to me even though it defines my entire meaning of life and everything i do revolves around making more of it i throw it away on piddly shit like this just because i can ,others

824,look at a product is warranty when you are shopping do not buy an appliance with a 1 year look for a 5 or more products are changed so often now you can not really go off reviews for an assessment of long term durability so the warranty length is the closest you can get ,others
825,and the 60 year life thing  a devices lifespan is normally a bit longer than the warranty period the lamp had a 5 year warranty so being generous here it should last 10 15 years if they really expected it to last 60 they would put their money where their mouth is and warrant it for 30 40 i can get a mattress with a better warranty than this 60 year lamp  that is all i need to know ,others

897,i just sent an email to the aeotec folks asking about switch input behavior the lamp that is my focus needs to pass the non tech wife test the floor lamp by her favorite reading chair the 3 way socket recently shorted out and with 3 way led bulbs being so expensive i replaced the socket with a one that has a full range rotary dimmer and used a 1500 lumen led bulb to replace the old incandescent it is plugged into a smart plug so it can be controlled while we are away but only if she remembers to leave that rotary switch on and asks siri to turn it off through ha i am hoping the aeotec folks will say that wiring the nano dimmer into the lamp i think i can hide it in the base will do the trick of both manual on off and dimming while letting automations control it regardless of the switch position ,controller

916,led strip lights are one of those things where there are a ton of different and varying qualities outputs and lifespans i have done a lot of research and have favorites the question for you is really what is the intended use and lifespan you are looking for vs budget if you are looking for something that will last 10 15 years have amazing color rendering use the best leds with the best phosphors 3 4oz copper strip for heat dissipation and a really bright output you probably want to avoid aliexpress and most amazon sellers i am sure there are great ones on amazon i couldnt find it also here in this page i have seen people link to amazon with referral links check the link before you take someones advice 5050s are the older led type and pretty inefficient compared to the new leds out there if you are looking for color changing rgb yeah the 5050s are good but if you are looking for cove lighting with a nice warm white i would recommend 3014 2835 2216 and 2110 leds in high density  you are probably going to need something 300 500 lumen per foot on a dimmer if you need some good output i recommend going with a 24v light as you can make longer runs without doltage drop or uses of amplifiers amazon is a crapshoot i have had great results for small behind the tv projects but when purchased again from same seller the product changed and was junk others i got from amazon got too hot i think they are overdriving the leds to achieve brightness  great super bright product i ordered years ago and the lights are still extremely bright run cool and they had a design service for free where i took my photos of my project and they built it all out and quoted it a little more than i wanted to spend but for a 30 day guarantee i said go for it they have like 1500 5 star reviews that i assume are real i love these  i also tried these guys but i cannot find where you can buy online anymore they had a good selection of dimmers and remotes and i used their lower output lights on my kickboards they are still running well  great for dmx and controlls i havent tried their lights honestly but the specs look good just make sure you compare apples to apples and compare 1 lumen output per foot 2 how many oz of copper in pcb 3 watts foot 4 maximum run length 5 warranty 6 compatibility with dimming systems 7 for me customer support and warranty 8 price i tend to go higher quality higher price i think i paid like dollar115 for the flex fire stuff per reel but it was 3x as bright as the other stuff and has lasted forever 9 color temperature and cri will each reel you get match the other reels color you do not want 5 reels with different shades of white even a slight variation sucks i love strips and have them everywhere good luck edited for missing info,brightness

927,h fele,brightness
928,if you do not mind swapping them out every year or so buy the waterproof 5050s from supernight on amazon for dollar12 and do your own 12v wiring i buy 50 100 rolls at a time for theatrical installations and they are surprisingly consistent color and dimming wise they hold up really well and the weatherproof coating while it builds up dust easier is better for longevity  if you want quality long lasting leds with top quality color and anti flicker i second the guy recommending environmental lights that is where i buy all of my led dmx gear from they are great folks and offer a lot of help in planning your projects and can get you set up with everything you would need ,color
929,i really love the led strip from sanwo they can do a rainbow chasing effect even work with alexa and google home  ,color
930,i like to use dc power myself ,controller
931,rgb leds are the best kinds of leds ,color
932,how are you controlling dmx lights via alexa google assistant ,controller
933,what does copper thickness have to do with light output ,brightness
934,you can get lightify expansion sets for those if you desire perfect color matching it is not super cheap but imho worth it ,color
935,you can buy these  separately but i agree they are necessary for most applications ,others
936,it reads like an advert not a review i am sure you are just trying to give good advice but somehow it feels fishy like the company had this written in the about us section that is probably why it was downvoted ,others
937,sure i have got three of those and just bought two more strips this one from amazon is cheap and works well  also the pinout on the gledopto controller is f would up and printed wrong see the last image in my post for the proper wiring order to get it to show up with the proper colors in hue ,controller
938,heat dissipation is a big issue with leds more copper more heat dissipation more brightness potential ,brightness
939,not sure i am super concerned with 100percent matching color i thought dollar15 for 6 feet seemed a little pricey though ,color
940,that seller also sell tracks but sliding a rigid led strip in that groove is so much sastifying than peel stick and pray it is perfectly square and flush ,others
941,oh my that last point is so helpful thank you friend ,others
942,you are wonderful thank you for the in depth response i will surely know what i am getting myself into now ,others
943,that same resistivity exists in heat transfer too so practical heat dissipation will be better with thicker copper since the heat reaches more surface area more easily ,others
944,hey i know i might be necro ing a thread here but did you ever get those sk6812 strips i am planning on buying those exact ones from btf and a wall adapter 5v 10a were they any good ,others
945,i think that unless you are into color control smart switches have a lot more utility than bulbs with any smart solution be careful though the equipment can outlast the company is cloud offerings so be wary of startups and lesser known companies as they have higher risk of folding shop without a community strong enough to figure out alternatives bonus to longevity if you can fully control the device without needing cloud services ,color
946,if your asking if it will save you money in the long run absolutely not smart bulbs will save you cents maybe dollars per year even of you could save dollar2 a year in energy costs that is still 8 15 years you would need to use it to make it worth it the bulb probably will not even last that long they are worth it however for the convenience especially if you actually automate them to the point that they interact with other devices and sensors in your house to turn on and off when needed on their own it is nice walking down the hallway and having your stairway light turn on dimmed to 5percent at 2am then walking into the kitchen to get a drink of water and the cabinet lights are already on and dimmed to a comfortable brightness ,brightness
947,cost wise look at other options than hue bulbs for example i use yeelight color leds and have found them to be excellent they are currently on amazon for dollar29 99 so a lot cheaper than the hue at around dollar49 99 i have them around the house and love them hue lights also require you to purchase a hub so thats another consideration when buying some like lifx and yeelights connect directly to your home wifi and can be connected either through their own app or through another like google home or amazon alexa are smart lights worth it personally which ever you use i think they are having the ability to automate your lights and control them remotely is great having them come on at certain times dusk etc while you are away adds to your home security you can also set them up with if this then that ifttt so that they come on when you arrive home again they are not needed but they do offer great benefits and convenience ,others
948,guy with a newborn here totally worth it,brightness
949,do you cohabit the house with anyone my biggest issue with the smart bulbs was my son and wife still physically flip switches leaving the lights completely useless i installed a smart dimmer switch to test it out and it is far more convenient for my situation that and it was dollar30 and controls 5 lights ,controller
950,it depends i have both smart bulbs and smart switches in play in my home my wife has a daylight balanced pretty bright bulb in a lamp for crafting purposes we put it on a smart switch from idevices so she can turn it on and off without having to unearth herself from whatever knitting project she is buried under a hue bulb would not have enough brightness and the lamp has a switch meanwhile we have hue lightstrips behind the tv that come on white at sunset adjust color for movie watching and i have hue color bulbs in my front porch lights that i have set to all kinds of colors depending on the season blue for winter red green for halloween yellow for spring etc the nice bit of them all being smart regardless of how you do it is they can all shut down with a simple hey siri goodnight command when we go to bed ,brightness
951,phillips hue are high quality product and its ecosystem is pretty ok hue virtually are supported by all home automation platform and zigbee z wave in terms of hw and sw support for cost saving there are also bulbs from ikea innr osram yeelight etc however if you are looking to invest that big and you own the house smart switch should also be considered bulbs still need be replaced like every 5 10 years at best switches do not that said i would say maintaining 10 15 bulbs or so in your entertaiment living room bedroom is totally worth it the color ambiances just give a distinct vibes and imo functional e g color temp based on time night light syncing with movie music ,color
952,i will say there are plenty of smart lights cheaper than hue bulbs i will also say that for me it is not worth it it is actually annoying to me to think i would have to say a phrase or whip out my phone to turn on off a light i think the colors can be cool for the right usages but more of a neat toy rather than a need ,color
953,depends what you mean by smart if you are just using them to change the colours then probably not because who ever needs their lights to be blue green or red but automating things like having them automatically turn on off when you enter or leave a room is useful or having your outdoor lights turn on off at certain times to save power or when you arrive home is good ,color
954,smart lighting is worth it smart bulbs are not at least for me anyways i have switched that control 5 lights i can automate that with a switch for around 20 dollars it would take much more to replace the bulbs plus once the bulb burns out you replace it meanwhile the switch keeps on working if you care about color you prolly only want it in a few places get hue bulbs for those places i guess also you do not have to do the whole house anyways do the places that you enjoy the most ,color
955,i still like switches better the only way i would get a bulb is if it was a lamp where the light is not controlled by a switch i have two smart bulbs on each bedside table and it is annoying when my wife turns it off manually and the app can not find it ,controller
956,i first smart dimmers to smart bulbs because i have no use for different colors in my house ,color
957,i would say it depends i have got multiple switches all over my house some controlling the same lights some controlling different lights the only compatible switches i could find for my wiring was lightwave rf and the set up was going to be a nightmare with slave switches etc and very expensive in the end i went down the ikea tradfri route and so far i have been happy with them it is worth looking into what you require what you want them to do and what you currently have installed and what your wiring is before deciding which way to go ,others
958,the only place i use smart bulbs are lamps or where i care about the color in my office workshop i have the adjustable temp white bulbs which are great otherwise smart switches are the way to go ,color
959,i would get some for a select few places and go from there i have 5 or 6 total the ones i love the most are the ones that i have on a motion sensor one in our bedroom converted to a walk in closet where the light switch is broken and i do not want to walk over to the lamp every time and one in the laundry room that is pitch black and has the light switch about 10 feet from the door i walk in to those rooms and the light turns on automatically i also have all of the lights in my bedroom converted to smart lights it is nice to have them turn on early in the morning to help wake me up and also to have lamps in multiple places that do not reach the outlet controlled by the light switch ,controller
960,is that 2k for the full color control lights or just the standard white lights full color is 50 a bulb iirc and standard white was 15 which can be pretty steep i like mine because it is hooked up to my alexas and i can voice control all the lights in my house but i do not have any desire to have crazy colors going on ,color
961,use switches when you just want dimmers or on off bulbs when those solutions do not work if you want colors which i would recommend around media centers and bedrooms then you can go hue lifx or even ikea tradfri which is great quality for the price ,color
962,yes i have all my house full of yeelight and is amazing for example when i am 100meters far from home the lights turn off when i wake up the lights turn on automatically it is amazing,brightness
963,i think they have their place but are widely used where there are better options i will take a smart socket plug over a smart bulb and a lutron dimmer over a smart plug  i know people who use hue bulbs in lamps plugged into an outlet controlled by a switch that does not make any sense to me ,color
964,pretty much echoeing everyone else switches and plugs are definitely the more versatile way to go i wish i had that as a option i have to use the bulbs because my home was built in 1900 and does not have ground wires for switches i use hue bulbs throughout ,others
965,i was not into color control until i started noticing color temperature i blame r flashlights for that and now i am very into color control i have lights scheduled for 4500k when i want comfortable light and 5500k when i want more light and have lights programmed for sunrise and sunset settings that run the full 1700k 6500k range i wish i used more of the color setting for color i do have some exceptions that i use for amood and i am sure i will probably goof around with some holiday settings but color temperature has become my most used program schedule for the bulbs i am still looking at switches and outlets but the ifttt bulb schedules are working now to have the house lit according to schedule action for now using yeelight color bulbs nanoleaf aurora the aurora panels are set to quite a few color displays but it is more a room accent than actual lighting ,color
966,out of curiosity how did you implement that motion sensor combined with time of day settings ,others
967,can i control the yeelights with a google home or echo device i am still brand new to this so sorry if this is a silly question ,brightness
968,consider the load on your wifi of lifx yeelight though given that op estimates to spend dollar2000 it sounds like he is looking at about 40 bulbs that many additional devices on your wifi will have an impact on your router and you might need to upgrade that hue does not have that issue as it has its own hub ,brightness
969,what makes zwave better than wifi based switches curious as a rookie here ,others
970,there are no silly questions we all start learning somewhere i use a google home mini and you can control yeelights from there i have not used an amazon echo yet so can not comment on that i am still in the process of trialling the lights with the google home so do not yet know what it is fully capable of i can say that basic interaction is possible once you have linked either the mi home app or the yeelight app to your google home  examples of this would be hey google turn on off the bedroom lights or hey google turn the hallway lights to red hope this helps ,color
971,the design is not my cup of tea but very encouraging to see new homekit devices ,others

976,what is so special about this use any lamp and apply either a smart plug or smart light done edit downvoters ok spell it out what is so special about this lamp ,others
977,my thought as well ,others
978,650lm when set to cool white which is not massively bright to light a room but more than adequate for reading or for mood lighting ,brightness
979,hue smartplugs are pretty terrible ,brightness
980,nanoleaf essential bulb,brightness
981,same been doing it for years not sure why anyone would want a homekit lamp just get a much better looking lamp and add a bulb and you are done this thing is so ugly and janky looking ,others
982,problem with that is literally nothing supports it right now not compared to what is out there maybe that will change soon though i hope it does ,others
983,agreed on the poor design of this lamp  however a use case does exist where a user wishes to use both a hard switch as well as homekit to control the lamp certainly other ways to accomplish with a separate homekit button but not as elegant as a lamp with the switch built in ,others

986,so i am waiting for the 4 4 update as u neekster404 suggests but i received the channels today and wanted to update that the ones i ordered muzata u107 are not as spotless as their name description would imply i can totally see the led spots they just are not deep enough i should have ordered the u108 which are taller putting more space between the led and diffuser but they were and still are out of stock on amazon the spotting is not a huge issue i don t think for this application i will not be looking directly at the lights as they will be facing into the room corner the curved diffuser will hopefully do a good job of spreading the light onto the walls i am going to do a test this evening to see if i can see bright spots of light on the walls if i could have gotten the u108 i would have should have ,brightness
987,no advice besides stating that numerous other have exclaimed they have not had an issue with cutting but just wanted to say i admire the ingenuity and can not wait to see project updates ,others
988,bit of an old thread but honestly thanks for the idea govee makes one like this now but i already own strips and might do something like this this also opens up an opportunity to do custom heights and such ,others
989,any updates on this project i am intrigued but seems it may have fizzled out after flushing out the design perhaps ,others
990,this is very helpful info thank you now i just have to find the patience ,others
991,is there someplace you found that upcoming release info that i can check from time to time ,others
992,govee updates their app about every month and half and they have indicated that 14 more devices will support the new scene modes in that update i am just assuming that the h6143 44 will be part of those 14 this information is found keep your eyes peeled for a new update ,others
993,the anticipation has been nerve racking i want to build my lamps thanks for coming back and updating me ,brightness
994,well the update does not seem to have included what i was hoping for the only new function that let is you specify the starting point on the strip power end for me is the separation one however the light reaction on this one is sporadic at best there are periods when it sits completely dark and others fully lit regardless of the music sound activity when it does look like it is working it sends varying lengths of lit leds from the start point down the length of the strip what i was really hoping for was the spectrum setting but being able to start it at the end of the strip instead of the middle i want the rise and fall of the lights with sound like a spectrum analyzer i guess i will build my lamps and use them as non reactive to sound and hope that a future update will add what i really want ,others
995,intro i have purchased these lights for my significan not other although i have not compared the two products side by side phillips color wiz and phillips hue i can say that for dollar15 it is a great deal also a hub is not required as it connects to your wifi colors the colors are accurate and bright they are better than the first generation phillips hue since it can actually do shades of green while dragging my finger across the color spectrum i have noticed that the color sort of slightly jump if you are looking directly at the light rather than transitioning smoothly but that is to be expected with a dollar15 price tag it might not be able to do 16 millions shades of color that phillips hue advertises app the app is okay setting up is okay it is pretty basic you do have scenes stuff like candlelight fireplace and wake up routines siri google alexa it does not work with siri google alexa right out of the box i have heard you can set up a routine with ifttt to let it work with shortcuts on the iphone compatibility with hue since it uses two different apps i would not place it in the same room as your current lights due to the inconvenience unless you can a ifttt statement to adjust both brands of light automatically with siri or do not mind switching between apps cons separate app from phillips hue connects directly to wifi multiple bulbs could potentially slow down your wifi depending on speed and amount of bulbs wiz app is basic no accessories similar to hue tap motion sensor etc tl dr it is great for dollar15 buy it and try it out you have 90 days to return it back to home depot ,color
996,is home depot subsidizing these to make them so inexpensive do bt and zigbee really add dollar35 to the hue color bulbs ,color
997,fwiw i tried them and gave up the color is very nice and vivid but the lack of google home integration and needing a separate app from hue are deal breakers ,color
998,do these bulbs sync well across different platforms like smartthings google home alexa if you make a change to color in google home does it reflect quickly in the alexa app i bought some cheap sengled color bulbs although they cost more than these and if i change the color in one app the other app does not recognize the change it makes it way too complicated and i am going to return them  i am looking for another cheap alternative i do not need them to be super bright and honestly i usually use them at a very low dimmed percent at night anyway so the lower the dimmable range the better i often notice that the brighter the bulb is the more difficult it is to achieve a very low dimmed setting  thinking about giving these a go ,color
999,question for these bulbs if you accidentally turn them off without voice activation and turn them back on they auto default to warm white is there a way to have them auto default to a different color ,color
1000,for the bulb i was interested in downlight hue has a cri of 80 while wiz is 90 no brainer for me ,color
1001,late to the party but i give these an 8 10 considering the dollar15 price tag i have 2 of them in my bedroom they seem to be good and fun nothing too crazy or fancy the setup is a pain they just did not want to connect to my wifi turned off 5ghz temporarily and a few other things until they finally manually setup i have a unifi access point the app is basic but has what it needs no siri but has alexa and google home i have mine setup to turn on in the evening and change brightness and color throughout the evening seems to work without any issues my wife uses the light switch to turn on and off hers and it always reconnects to wifi no issue sometimes i do see sync issues with one light bright and the other dim the colors are fun and bright the kids love it and its nice to have mood setting lights that are not just white i noticed the two bulbs are slightly off color from each other the warm white on one is more greenish than yellow not a big deal but noticeable my only main complaint is i wish they made a remote or switch to put on the wall instead of just the app when i have other bulbs die in my house i will replace with these for fun ,color
1002,is it worth the extra dollar3 bulb to go from white adjustable to full color ,color
1003,i bought 2 wiz bulbs at homedepot for dollar30 canadain they connect over wifi just fine but you do need 2 4ghz they also work with my nest mini i found this post because i was wondering why anyone would pay dollar60 for a hue bulb both are made by philips the wiz also does not require a hub and you can turn them on and off from outside of your house i used the android app and the ios app both work nicely  for dollar30 i have been really happy with them and can not think of a way to make them better ,color
1004,what i like about these is they have colored versions that fit in new construction hi hat cans and philip hue does not have them that can fit in 6 in hi hat cans new construction,color
1005,i have both phillips hue is better in every way than the phillips wiz bulbs rich color brighter light more extensive app easier to use with google alexa and hue connects to the hub and the hub connects to the router instead of a million wifi connections to the router setting up the wiz lights is a nightmare and it fails often they also drop from wifi every now and again and you can not change the color until you cycle the power all of my hue products have success on the first try i have 4 wiz lights and 8 hue bulbs 2 hue led strips 2 hue lamps 1 multi switch and 2 wifi remote switches the wiz has 1 switch available but it just looks like a roku remote if you can not afford the hue lights but you can get the wiz lights go for it they do not necessarily suck but if you look at them side by side you will see that you get what you paid for i am going to cycle out my wiz lights ,color
1006,for siri you have to make the existing light setting to a particular scenes and have to create a sentence for this scenes an example that i made the bulb to romantic created scense and write down i am going to make some love the when i talked to siri that i want to make some love the bulb will automatically changed to the color in romantic colors of course you can do the repeat the step to warm white cool white which mean you would finihsed ,color
1007,do you still need to buy a light switch to operate these and if so if you bought a dimmable one will it work ,others
1008,home depot is site says these integrate with alexa sira and google ,others
1009,for alexa you need to auto add device and the bulbs will show up add them that way then you can voice control each bulb or add them to a room and auto control the whole rooms bulbs i e master bedroom so far they work wonderfully and for the price you can not compare ,controller
1010,yeah i use mine with google and alexa both no issues,controller
1011,second this just bought a wiz today for my office because i do not have an overhead light was a pain to turn on lamps i used these and they integrate with my google pixel and alexa ,others
1012,give them a shot but if youre looking for simplicity i think thats where the extra cost of the hue come in these work but they are a pain in the ass it comes with cool scenes out of the box but to get your alexa or any assistant to recognize them you have to set each scene through ifttt which only lets you use the phrase alexa trigger light mode i do not really like saying trigger to activate but oh well nitpicking if you want to just do solid colors and basic stuff youre all set alexa will make your lights blue or green once you set her up with them my cons so far after 1 week of use could be how i set it up but going from hue white lights to these have pissed me off and make me jealous of people who can fully outfit hue color or lifx alexa is warm white on these are almost tan red when i ask to turn on all of the lights only my kitchen goes on some times the lights can be somewhat slow to respond some just randomly do not listen on occasion my internet is 300mb down with cox panoramic wifi and all my devices are ethernet so the wifi should be pretty open for these all in all 8 of these are like 100 bucks vs the 4 500 for hue this is about as budget as smart lights can get maybe i will get better with them in the future but so far i am just annoyed wiz lights in general are in a desperate need for tutorial vids but they are not massively adopted yet if anyone can find a way to seemlessly integrate ifttt or other smart home stuff please let me know its all been a headache so far and my largest complaint they do not seem very smart guests are going to have alot of trouble with these if someone comes over to watch your pets for the weekend be prepared to give them a crash course of what phrases to say and how to say them ,color
1013,you can choose whether you would like them to return to the most recently used color or default to one of two favorite settings returning to a favorite setting is known as wizclick and the idea is that you can easily get to your favorite light settings without having to use your phone virtual assistant so far i prefer to turn off wizclick meaning if you flip the switch off then back on the light stays on the same setting wizclick annoyed me because it switches between your top two favorite colors meaning sometimes you have to flip your light switch twice to get the color you want i would rather just choose one color to default to if you wanted them to auto default to a different color you could just change your favorite for the bulb to whatever color and turn on wizclick overall i am super happy with these lights i have purchased 20 bulbs so far and i love them ,color
1014,had a pretty high powered ap about 6 feet from the bulbs running only 2 4ghz band i think there was maybe some weird software problem as it would work when i pair them until i turn the switch off then they would forget that they were paired and the app could not find them i just bought some hue bulbs instead ,color
1015,is the above still applicable to you usage of wiz i bought mine recently in aus and have none not a single one of the issues you bring up,others
1016,thanks i am assuming you can still make it a nice warm white ,color
1017,as others have said you can buy them for a higher price directly from their website karrie locher on insta recently did a review of similar lights due to the vava not being sold on amazon anymore it might be in her highlights ,others
1018,i saw something about how you can only buy it direct from their website now not sure why the change though ,others
1019,i was wondering the same thing i have been planning on buying once i actually got pregnant but now it is not on amazon and it looks like the company does not ship to canada ,others
1020,oh noooo i have one of those too and love it i wish i could tell you but hope that someone else will be able to say with any certainty ,others
1021,can someone share how this light differs from the hatch the hatch seems to have more features but this is obviously cheaper heading to the us in september  and if it is as good as you are all saying i might just need one ,others
1022,interesting what does that mean exactly i love it so much i actually went to buy a second a few weeks ago and was so sad it is no longer available ,others
1023,me too ,others
1024,interesting mine turns all the way off but it is the harder plastic non silicone one that does not change colours just yellow or white tinge light maybe that is the difference i love the portability of it and how you can dim it very low that being said if it never shut all the way off i would not like it as much my kids room needs to be dark to the point i have debated covering up the little blue charting light when it is on the dock ,color
1025,the light has two settings 1 warm white dim to bright you can double tap the top to turn on the the brightness you had set it to previously press and hold from off to turn it on very dimly press and hold from on to adjust brightness nice for middle of the night stuff mostly and 2 colours cycles through colours and then you can select one of those colours to be the colour that turns on every time the colours do not dim better for mood lighting or distracting the baby lol but i use this feature very rarely ,brightness
1026,interesting it feels like there has to be something more to it though because i have recieved a lot of products that have the amazon review for a gift card promo inside including anjou which suck and they have not been pulled yet vava which i have both the nightlight and monitor and both are amazing high quality products are pulled curious ,others
1027,hah could be profitable lol i will have to check out the hatch because the glowing at night is really annoying,brightness
1028,i hope this is only temporary the monitor is honestly so much better than i was expecting it to be and was such a good price i had just reccomended both products to a friend who is expecting in the fall ,others
1029,a relative of mine who has oily skin gifted this to me once she swore up and down that it was her favorite sunscreen as someone with dry skin i hated this as you said it is ridiculously matte however i did not have any issues with a white cast or with removal the texture of the liquid is quite nice though applying it felt good it is just once it sets it leaves a super dry powdery film like feel to the skin throughout the day the film felt like it was really tight and made my skin feel like it was cracking not comfortable edit oh i just realized you also said that it felt like it was cracking on the skin did not mean to come off as redundant but it really is an accurate description ,controller
1030,how long did it take for jolse to deliver ,controller
1031,i keep a pump bottle of olive oil for stubborn waterproof sunscreens especially the spray on body sunscreens i rub down everything with a generous amount of olive oil and use a soft cloth to scrub before i get in the shower then i emulsify my face with dhc cleansing oil and use eucerin shower oil cleanser everywhere else ,controller
1032,i agree the liquid texture is nice enough but everything else sort of failed for me if your skin is super oily like you can fry eggs on your face oily yeah then this will work well normal to dry skin will not tolerate it as well though ,controller
1033,i can not really use olive oil wish i could because it breaks me out horribly  but it is a great tip for others who are not bothered by olive oil ,others
1034,bullshit the quantity of negative ions produced by a himalayan salt lamp is negligible and even if they did produce negative ions in a meaningful quantity science has so far not shown any benefits ,others
1035,it is nice ambient light ,brightness
1036,read somewhere someone talking about how they thought it was bullshit and then stayed at a bed and breakfast where there was one and discovered that it emits just the right wavength light to hide blemishes but let you see while having sex they then bought one at home negative ions are fake news so i must ask what benefits are you referring to ,brightness
1037,bullshit i am not smart enough to explain it but varitasium is ,others
1038,i recently watched a veritasiam video about this the belief is that when heated the lamps produce negative ions which are known for boosting mood in people but yes this is bs in this case salt lamps can produce negative ions however it is such a small amount not even complicated machinery can detect it your best solution to getting those negative ions would just to go outside go on a nature walk walk by the water go outside when it thunders and rains salt lamps bs going outside not bs negative ions not bs,others
1039,  short answer they are bullshit ,others
1040,completely agree that it is bs however recently purchased one from the sister of a new co worker in a blatant attempt to make nice at my new job i could use all the help i can get and dollar50 was worth a try ,others
1041,double bullshit the health benefits are supposed to be from negatively charged ions but i saw a test where scientist could not detect any negatively charged ions coming off of the thing also after over 100 years of research on positively and negatively charged ions scientists have been able to find absolutely no health benefit whatsoever ,others
1042,bullshit benefits are supposed to be due to the heating of the salt to release the negative chlorine ions but it is ineffective at releasing them there is limited evidence suggesting that negative ions are good for us and that is why these lamps are sold veritasium does a great video explaining  ,others
1043,veritasium made a great video about this a few days ago actually it explains the idea behind the lamps as well as proving ways they could work here is the link  if you do not want to watch the video it was basically no the lamps can not produce what they say they can which is negative ions the tings that are supposed to make you feel good but there are other substances that can ,others
1044,i think red light is meant to be easy on the eyes when it is almost bed time right ,color
1045,a girlfriend gave me one it is a nice night light ,brightness
1046,i have one on my desk at work it gives off a nice warm glow which counteracts the harsh cold fluorescent lighting if nothing else i love it for that ,brightness
1047,i want to leave a helpful comment to cat and dog owners on here in case you own a salt lamp do not let them lick the lamp because they are poisonous to them ,others
1048,its all bullshit can verify bought one for my mom but also a geologist minerals do not have special healing powers just by being in your general vicinity ,others
1049,not only are the benifits bullshit for reasons previously stated by others but that pink salt does not even come from the himalayas it is usually mined in poland or pakistan ,others
1050,apparently the negative ion thing is bs as i have googled it many a time we were given one as a gift and i was wondering about their effectiveness as dehumidifiers but can not find any discussion about that ,others
1051,interestingly enough i just watched this  video about the purported benefits of negative ions seems like a completely irrelevant thing but they talk about these salt lamps in the video ,others
1052,i like them the glow is nice i take vitamin d to stay happy ,brightness
1053,whatever is attributed to it it is all placebo ,others
1054,what about the supposed air purifying effect it is supposed to attract and re evaporate moisture particles in the air trapping dust and pollen on the salt ,controller
1055,the idea of the salt lamp is that it purifies the air in a similar way that gargling sea salt water can help draw infection from your mouth or tonsils heating up the lamp a few degrees with a standard light bulb is not going to do anything the idea that the salt is natural ions float through the air and absorb toxins has never been tested and since there is absolutely no evidence that salt sitting in a room can change the electrical charge in the surrounding air i call bullshit the only way that ions can even remotely purify air is to be emitted through one of those commercial ionizers and even those are sketchy just open a window ,others
1056,there is a whole store in santa barbara dedicated to these things crazy they are essentially the snake oil of our time lol,others
1057,i do not know anything about the supposed benefits of these lamps and i have never looked them up before but there is an ad for salt lamps on my side bar right now targeted ads are really doing too much  ,others
1058,they are pretty tasty so that is one thing,others
1059,i give mine a good lick every now and again to get some salt or when i forget to dust my margarita glass ,controller
1060,98 2percent bullshit the color of the lamp means that it will not disrupt your sleep if it is the only light source including screens that you use at night and some pollutants can be drawn from the air in negligible amounts on contact with the salt in practical terms it really is not anywhere near as effective as using warm color lights and a color temperature controller on your electronics and having houseplants or an air filter ,color
1061,i have a large one i just love the light it relaxes me at night i know it does not do anything but it helps my fight my fright my friends occasionally lick it though ,brightness
1062,they should warn people about this put it on a plate and you will not regret it later ,others
1063,yeah if you do not turn them on for more than 12 to 6 hours depending on your humidity they will start to run so basically just leave your salt lamps running all the time ,controller
1064,what if someone bought 500 of them and they are shipping to their house right now because they thought it was a bulk purchase for a convenience store when the real plan is to have 40 in every room including closets ,others
1065,are any of the ion bullshit real i know the ionic water filters are bullshit same with all the various wrist bands ,others
1066, explains why ,others
1067,came to say this also do not let you cats lick it ,others
1068,which is interesting because the supposed scientific benefits are what a seller once used to try to get me to buy one i am glad i did not have the money because i almost got it knowing it is fake just makes me want to storm into that place and scold them but i am not like that so i just hope they go out of business ,others
1069,i just got it because the lighting is pretty a couple years later i heard about the health benefits ,brightness
1070,i have read in other subreddits that women seem to like them as their sexy times night light because of the soft light that is enough to see by but leaves something to the imagination and hides in shadow whatever flaws they feel they have ,others
1071,yeah i love my salt lamp because it emits the absolute most flattering light i have ever seen hahaha,brightness
1072,fun fact that is where red light districts get their name ,color
1073,i think they are just referring to the calming affect it is a nice light to have and it really does help calm my anxiety when i have it on other than that i do not think there are really other benefits ,brightness
1074,got links to any reading about negative ions superficially with my high school knowledge of chemistry in college level knowledge of physics and science anything about negative ions sounds like pure pseudoscience ,controller
1075,negative ions also bs sorry ,others
1076,also showers ,others
1077,how do we know it produces negative ions if we can not detect them ,others
1078, umm which would release the moisture back into the room ,controller
1079,that is bullshit too they do not so any such thing in a measurable effect ,others
1080,totally agreed well maybe not about the licking it but the other part,others

1087,r oddlyspecific,others
1088,no it is all bullshit top to bottom it is banking on nobody knowing what an ion is which is depressing as hell tbh ,others
1089,why was this downvoted lol i have heard this same thing from several women some people obviously got upset,others
1090,yeah but they all have serious problems with how they conducted their experiments meta analysis shows negative ions do not matter,others
1091,i feel happy when i walk by running water because of the nice sound and the fresh smell of the outdoors if i put a salt lamp fountain in my home do not have now wish i did though then i will feel happy because i like the look of the salt lamp and the sounds of the water until there is more research on this i am not going to believe that ions are the reason that things that make me happy when i curl up on the couch with my favorite blanket some tea i do not think my blanket tea are letting off some ions so that is why i am happy it just does not make sense ,others

1106,i am not trying to be pedantic or contrarian but i must point out that youtube links are not as credible as actual research even from someone like veritasium he gets a lot of basic science right but in this case i really want to see his sources and i am glad that he links them i am also glad you took the simple steps so so thoroughly debunk the lamp itself among his sources there is only a few are actually scientific research  without even opening the paper we can take some wisdom from the summary results  consistent ionization effects were not observed for anxiety mood relaxation sleep and personal comfort in contrast meta analysis results showed that negative ionization overall was significan notly associated with lower depression ratings with a stronger association observed at high levels of negative ion exposure mean summary effect and 95percent confidence interval ci following high and low density exposure 14 28 95percent ci 12 93 15 62 and 7 23 95percent ci 2 62 11 83 respectively the response to high density ionization was observed in patients with seasonal or chronic depression but an effect of low density ionization was observed only in patients with seasonal depression however no relationship between the duration or frequency of ionization treatment on depression ratings was evident conclusions  no consistent influence of positive or negative air ionization on anxiety mood relaxation sleep and personal comfort measures was observed negative air ionization was associated with lower depression scores particularly at the highest exposure level future research is needed to evaluate the biological plausibility of this association with a confidence level of 95percent that means is a 1 and 20 chance this is pure bullshit even then they are only claiming it helps with depression a little bit and they have no plausible mechanism to explain why consider the effect of jelly beans on acne this is exactly how a lot of other pseudo scientific woo starts people start by finding anomalous data and then reading into how much it affects things just like that chemical in grapes they found in the 90s that reduce blood pressure so a bunch of news outlets ran with headlines claiming that red wine would reduce blood pressure anecdotally this looks true because relaxing reduces blood pressure and a lot of people relax when they drink wine but very little of that chemical makes it into the wine and certainly not an amount large enough to be medicinal that one has largely fallen away with apologists mostly backing off and acknowledging that alcohol does more harm than good in most situations but others wind up turning into religions or the anti vax movement or something similar i am declaring salt ions as bullshit until or science comes out overwhelmingly in its favor edit add to this a lot of people who study this for people with an interest in getting their results one way or the other the paper that i linked was a meta analysis i did not do any actual research of their own but aggregated data from a large number of other papers this means they may have included papers from dubious sources or evening sources that just were not as rigorous as they could have been and could have been measuring some other effect it is been shown several times just helping scientists perform an experiment can change people is moods if people knew they were part of an experiment that by itself could have helped reduce depression because they knew that even if their work was a daily slog that they were helping science anyway this effect is real that has been measured many times also there is no way chlorine ions are good for you oh chlorine gas is a primary component in mustard gas oh maybe some other ions are good for you but sodium ions we will also melt your face literally unless there are too many sodium ions then they will explode your face literally i have not read the paper to know if they accounted for this but it is just so bullshit on its face i am hesitant to at this point i would need some believer to bring evidence to me oh the same state i am in for bigfoot ghosts nessie lizard people chemtrails and a bunch of other woo y conspiracy theories ,others

1127,i like this one i got on amazon naturebright suntouch plus light and ion therapy lamp sorry link not working it is dollar49 i can not speak to the whole 12 vs 18 but it works for me ,brightness
1128,from amazon it sounds like 12 14 is needed for 10 000 lux still by far the best i have seen for the dollar100 mark especially since it seems easier than most lamps to adjust it to be that close to you the one i am using sits right on my desk if i could raise it up to eye level it would be probably 12 away from me i will have to keep it in mind thanks ,brightness
1129,it could always be a placebo if it is one like  nobody seems to know the distance you need to be for 10 000 lux so most likely it is very close 6 or less and yeah they are supposed to be obscenely bright they have to trick your brain into thinking you are getting sunshine after all ,brightness
1130,yeah the problem is that at least from i have seen you need to be exposed to 10 000 lux to gain most of the benefits from a sad lamp why would 1 500 lux be enough no matter where or how it is positioned ,brightness
1131,huh i do not see the lamp you are talking about in the post though i was curious about what lamp you used for them i actually commented on your comment before making this thread ,others

1134,i ended up purchasing the northern light 10 000 lux therapy box after reading this  i have been using it for a couple of weeks now and can already feel a difference i use it for 20 minutes every morning when i am eating my breakfast and reading the internet when you do buy one make sure that you place it so the light is angling slightly down from above your eyes i ended up stealing a couple reams of paper from work and put the light therapy box on top of that i am sure there are easier diy solutions though i wish you the very best of luck dealing with seasonal affective disorder really sucks ,brightness
1135,i also reccommend the northern lights 10 000 lux therapy box it makes a bit of an improvement i just have to make sure i do not leave it on for too long i forget what the appropriate amount of time to sit next to it is but there is a recommended maximum just because it could affect your circadian rhythm i take at least 500 1 000 iud of vitamin d daily i recommend getting a good primary care provider who will test your vitamin d in the winter and provide helpful supplement recommendations the last time i got vitamin d bloodwork my level was 29 the minimum recommended level is 30 unfortunately my doctor was not very involved and helpful so i just chose supplements based on what i researched online feel free to pm me with any other questions ,brightness

1162,i went with medialight ir and control it via my logitech harmony homekit relevant because i have my harmony exposed to homekit via homebridge so homebridge homekit harmony ir medialight because my sony tv is itself homekit capable i am the able to use tv on off events to send the signal to the medialight it is a very effective and fast setup wife approval factor is high because it just works you might ask why not just use tv usb power to control the bias light unfortunately my new sony was not reliable my previous tv was but this model had the bias light going on and off all the time while the tv itself was off so hence the convoluted setup it does sound like medialight now offer a wi fi controller which i may need to checkout but my setup is working so well i may not bother ,controller
1163,if you want homekit and color changing hue might be the best bet probably have to get their play hdmi hub so the colors will change with the picture does not help you as you have a tv already but i have wondered if the philips tvs with ambient lighting built in can be linked to homekit ,color
1164,the hue sync box and lighting is great but it costs about dollar700 to get the full affect look at the govee immersion kit you will get very similar quality and do not need to worry about compatibility,color
1165,thanks everyone for the replies i am definitely not looking for an adaptive system like hue etc with it being an oled i am actually considering going without due to the brightness of the set vs my old plasma if i do decide to put lights behind i think it will be a nanoleaf lightstrip just to provide some basic lighting effect ,brightness
1166,i am not after true matched lighting just a nice subtle light to help your eyes the tv will already be amazing bright with it being an oled i am still thinking just a standard lightstrip will be fine but just considering my options ,brightness
1167,shoutout to r colorists,color
1168,the magichome wifi controller has native alexa and google home but currently only supports homekit via homebridge looking at the tuya wifi controller now and it also requires homebridge  looking for a manufacturer of a controller that works natively and will lyk ,controller
1169,thanks the reply i am actually considering this with the oled being so bright to start with ,brightness
1170,any good real ones you suggest for anyone who has yet to upgrade to oled or what specifically should one look for high cri rating i am guessing is recommended ,others
1171,how did you end up liking the nanoleaf light strip for a bias light i was thinking of buying the medialight but then i read with my sony tv there is a bug where it does not turn on off automatically so i started looking into a homekit light strip to just tell siri to turn it on off since i only use my apple tv through my tv ,brightness
1172,here is a sneak peek of r colorists using the  of the year  1   2   3   i am a bot beep boop  downvote to remove    ,color
1173,the bias light is installed on the tv and plugged into a usb port there the bias light has an ir receiver that allows it to be controlled from a basic remote control or a smart device which can send ir harmony hub is a logitech product for controlling media devices it has the ability to blast ir i trained the harmony hub with the remote from the bias light so that it can control the bias light on and off homebridge is open source software that runs on an always on computer server that can expose non native homekit devices as homekit devices there is a plug in for homebridge that allows me to expose my harmony hub over homekit since the bias light was setup in harmony hub it will now be exposed to homekit through homebridge this setup probably only made sense given that i already had the logitech harmony hub buying that plus the bias light is probably more money than buying hue light strips which i use and enjoy elsewhere ,controller
1174,actually my main point is probably just do not buy anything let your oled shine ,brightness
1175,that was my original plan and is the way i am probably going to go even if it is just for mood lighting in the room rather than in use to watch content ,brightness
1176,after setting up homebridge install the homebridge magichome dynamic platform plugin will require a restart of the homebridge the plugin automatically detects the bias lightning wifi receiver and added it to homekit plug in the advantage to the plug in is it also allows granular control over lighting intensity from 0 100percent in 1percent increments colored lights on an excellent accurate display like a c9 it is only going to make the screen look less accurate but as long as you can turn it off do what you like ,color
1177,yes i have a 2021 sx and it has that lighting n the cup holders and then in the doors and below the dash etc ,brightness
1178,if you have already made arrangements to fly out and pick it up then there really is not much you can do about it anyway at this point right and you will find out for yourself soon about the vin i do not know if there is some public facing part of kia is consumer website that lists all the options for a given vin but as a kia technician i have that info available to me if you are still curious and feel like dming a stranger your vin i would screenshot the list and dm it back it should list every installed option on your vin ,others
1179,i find myself finding more value in my blooms and iris than my normal br30 bulbs these days the bulbs are just too expensive per piece compared to z wave zigbee wall switches and using accent lights like bloom go and iris are so much more portable and easier to use to get a similar effect than moving lamps around ,color
1180,thanks for the replies but i was thinking shouldnt i just buy the the gen 3 bulb and a spotlight instead of the other two since it has more lumens,brightness
1181,i love my blooms i have got 4 wide range of vibrant colors and you can put them in some really cool places to accent walls corners or nooks ,color
1182,i love the bloom but i also have gen 3 bulbs in uplighter sockets which works just as well,brightness
1183,the go is super fun to play with and provides an amazingly bright light for the size everyone who handles it falls in love with it ,brightness
1184,i bought a refurbished black on and have it on top of my fridge i have a small kitchen area so it basically provides a glow for the whole thing it looks neat not worth the full msrp in my opinion though ,color
1185,my first experience with hue was with a go that i got basically for free apple is sorry for all the trouble we caused you present i immediately fell in love with it bought and bridge and now have 5 color bulbs the go can work independently no bridge needed but no wireless the built in dynamic candle setting is really nice i like the idea that you can bring it with you and have 3 hours of battery too cool effect when placed under my bed or behind furniture ,color
1186,i have 10 blooms and yes i like them i like them a lot perfect for areas without a light or if you want to project color on a wall ,color
1187,why do you need the battery function power cuts or for outside ,others
1188,from someone who has gen3 bulbs and go lamps i would take the go the go is are quite bright and due to portable nature can move them anywhere for a quick room change great for lighting features walls etc the only reason i would go the bulbs in a lamp over a go is if you wanted the bulb hidden in a lightshade this can give a different look the go is are better for features for mood lighting all together the lightstrips are king,brightness
1189,the battery function coupled with the nice size and shape has helped me with nice ambient lighting in a pinch for example i needed to see behind an entertainment center for an extended period of time while i ran new wires and i just popped a go back there and went about my work the go can also be just a nice temporary addition to a room if you are not interested in running wires for a short span of time ,brightness
1190,grab a couple ws2815 12v strips a meanwell power supply and a dig uno controller running wled ,controller
1191,welcome this is a song analysis that i am doing weekly or once in a while and there are a lot more to come if you want to check out my past reviews here are their links top link is the most recent  edition                                 ,others
1192,is it just me or do these look completely pointless and dumb i think they are really trying to ride the ambient lighting train til the end of the tracks and then some goodness what are they gonna come out with next ambient lighting mascara ,others
1193, have not watched it yet so i can not say how helpful it is ,others
1194,i actually think these could be cool i know a lot of people use the becca shimmering skin perfector liquid under their foundation to get a glow from within look depending on how bright these are i could see the appeal of combining a primer and the illuminator i like the look of mood light ,brightness
1195,just got this in luminous light yesterday i was a little disappointed when i swatched it did not seem like much but hopefully it will be magic on my skin when i try it this morning the way the powders are for me will report back ,brightness
1196,i may snatch up the light one as i do need a new primer and it looks nice also wayne goss has nice things to say and i generally trust his judgement ,brightness
1197,i ordered luminous light i do not wear foundation usually so i am excited to see how this works on its own ,brightness
1198,side note i presume anyone who uses pink color correctors to prevent sallow ness could use mood light instead of doubling up products and maybe get the same effect idk if pink is used to brighten but afaik it is ,color
1199,i was thinking the same thing something i like to do is use one primer on my face and then use a luminating primer mixed with my foundation to make it more dewy to me it kinda seems like these are made for that purpose i can not imagine they would have much of an effect otherwise ,brightness
1200,on this tangent i love the hourglass palettes too and i could not honestly figure out why other people did not so i asked at the store flagship store in venice what was up with that according to the manager they tweaked the formula so they are not nearly as powdery are more creamy and the matte shades are not patchy i wonder if he has new formula palettes and that explains the love ,others
1201,sounds likely i have such love for hourglass i hope this is true ,color
1202,i have a red light lamp when you read through the manual it does claim to do all that you listed above as well as help heal wounds and acne it is supposed to penetrate your skin and kill off certain bacterias or reduce some of the inflammation some dermatologists offer the treatment but to me it sounds like black magic i tried it out for a couple of nights having the light shine on my face for about 15 minutes 2x a day i noticed a very small difference i do not think it is worth buying there seems limited evidence that it actually works and it all sounds a bit too good to be true if only skincare and health was as simple as shining a light on yourself haha ,color
1203,christina hello has the makeon device from amore pacific that uses blue red and yellow lights you can read her review and ask her how she is finding it as she still uses the device ,color

1205,yea planet fitness okay i am pretty convinced this is hooey now haha but i might still get the black card for the massage machines ,others
1206,i do that black card cause for dollar10 more why not then you can bring people whenever and the massage chairs and i think we get a discount on drinks or something too,color
1207,haircuts we do not have that ,others
1208,the names are totally hourglass ,others
1209,also sounds like she ripped off the names from hourglass as well lol,others
1210,maybe an unpopular opinion but not everyone needs to recreate the wheel with make up packaging like if something is innovative sure but most cosmetic brands especially newer ones just starting out are using similar the same components as other brands it is not ripping off when those are the components offered by the factory you are manufacturing with ,others
1211,nothing is original anymore,others
1212,the collection is very much hourglass  with a splash of lanc me absolute  and a sprinkle of the kylie ultra glow all wrapped in a fenty box ,color
1213,maybe this is a dumb question but who cares what the pr looks like how many box shapes are there if you end up using a certain shape for the pr box that matches the component shape of some product who cares if she packaged the highlighters just like the highlighters of another brand yeah that is copying but why do we care about the pr package ,brightness
1214,it all felt very hourglass and becca which shows how dated jaclyn is because i barley hear from those brands,others
1215,i do not think it is that bad to use similar or the same packaging most companies are not creating custom components as others said there are only so many companies producing these types of packaging and brands have relationships with them jaclyn is people probably just found whatever company does packaging for whoever and chose them funnily enough i think the pr box looking exactly like fenty is just stupid it is just a beveled octagon she probably saw it and thought it looked the most fancy and offered good space inside fenty does not own the octagon shape and they do not own things being metallic silver jaclyn is attached to that tacky ass shiny silver even more than fenty imo and it does not even make sense because none of jaclyn is actual products look like that it is just a fucking pr box loooool and the highlighters are people actually joking they are just quad pan highlighters the packaging does not even look like anything specific it just looks like every quad pan ever and the loose powders are just in basic little cylinder jars with a shiny top how is that even ripping off anything it is just basic packaging lol i can not even believe people are going in this hard for her i can not believe i wrote this post ,brightness
1216,big big yawn reusing names   oh the horror and who tf cares if her pr box looks like fenty i know you are just looking to get some free upvotes and karma by starting another circle jerk hate thread on jaclyn yall are so predictable and tire ,others
1217,i am surprised hourglass did not send out a cease desist it is not as if it is a coincidence as if jaclyn did not know or something because she is raved about hourglass powders highlight on her channel before why copy the exact shade name of another luminous powder on the market but again it is jaclyn she is forever shameless lol,brightness
1218,oh really which ones i am not familiar with hourglass products just like the highlighter names in general ,others
1219,everything about it makes me think hourglass it is not original and you think she would learn ,others
1220,i was thinking the same thing even her description of it sounds like the absolue powder she always raves about ,others
1221,this is literally only talked about because it is jaclyn hill you could go on for days pointing out all the brands that are similar or have products ripping off another brand ,others
1222,to your point i feel like the strategic failure of not launching when she had initially said she would 3 4 years ago is what is causing her launches to feel drab i can not speak to the personal reasons her and her team could not launch then but the caveat is that the products by comparison seem dated and like copycats for those saying that she should get cease and desists i have a hard time believing a legal team would ok the launch of a product without vetting it first especially given the legal nightmare that was the first launch ,others
1223,me too or mac ,others
1224,hey jaclyn calm down thanks ,controller
1225,i did not really intend for this to be a hate thread on jaclyn i was just wanting to see people is perspectives on her choice of packaging i love to see people think outside of the box when it comes to packaging and names and themes this line does not really stand out to me because it looks like other brands instead of something she came up with on her own ,others
1226,she is probably had the lipstick components for 3 years more like it ,color
1227,mm didnt we just all watch shane dawson is palette get made its time consuming but not that time consuming jaclyn is a known liar i do not believe it took her 3 years to make lipstick components lol ,color
1228,i think there is one called mood light which is an hourglass powder ,color
1229,this sub when makeup revolution is literal business model is ripping off other brands   this sub when jaclyn hill breathes which is something other brand owners also do     ,others
1230,so who gets claim to a 4 square pan cheek palette is elf is also a becca rip off what about huda is wet wild has a 4 pan so does makeup revolution and natasha denona and charlotte tillsbury and urban decay it is four squares in a square it literally can not get more basic than that   ,others
1231,yes clearly she can not actually come up with her own unique ideas or names or packaging but she will make money as long as her product does not hurt anyone so that is that is what matters and if the other companies try to sue her more marketing pr for her ,others
1232,wow a four pan square palette so original,color
1233,would be helpful if you linked the stuff you are talking about ,others
1234,the controversy palette is not sold in a new component it looks exactly like the blood sugar and blue balls or whatever palette ,color
1235,she should have released one called fluorescent light ,color
1236,the difference is that we know she has a history of doing this tho she is not the most original person in the world and her lipsticks reminded people of her becca packaging and her morphe vault collection jaclyn does not know how to even spell original when it comes to makeup ,others
1237,mainly because it is a quad if four highlighters and it comes in light and dark ,color
1238,ignore it if you do not like it ,others
1239,blue balls palette ,color
1240, and now i am just going to use my new powder highlighter called fluorescent bathroom blinking light look at that pigment ,brightness
1241,but it is just so trendy to rip her apart for past mistakes and say anything beyond wow whatta coinkydink  s people are so focused on that even though mood lighting is a general phrase outside of hourglass products the packaging and product are somehow even less original imo ,others
1242,i answered a question ,controller
1243,my feeling is just if you are not interested do not buy it if it is a bad formula absolutely give it bad reviews if you get shitty customer service absolutely let people know but do not get your panties twisted because she dared to make square highlighters it makes it easier for her others to dismiss more serious criticism ,others
1244,nah you guys are way overreaching she has a history of doing this therefore we get to be assholes  everyone is packaging looks like everyone is packaging when there is no special concept happening that is the truth ,others

1252,one thing i would recommend is not just grabbing the first vitamin d supplement you see the supplement industry is shady as fuck and not all products are equal as there is minimal oversight and regulations with some products the results effects are probably no different than if you were to just eat your money i have used this service in the past which is a 3rd party that randomly tests products off the shelf and then rates them using a set of criteria the highest rated option i could find here was this one carlson vitamin d3 2000 iu 50 mcg bone immune health vitamin d supplements cholecalciferol supplement gluten free vitamin d capsules 360 softgels  i have seen people who have clout in this space recommend using labdoor as a resource they are supposed to be unbiased and impartial with their reports but i guess you never know unless you work there i would still rather use them than just blindly pick something off the shelf fish oil is another recommended product to combine with vitamin d i also use labdoor with this resource another 3rd party that tests and certifies for quality ,others

1261,yeah this sucks do not know whats wrong hope someone can help because the whole point of buying it was to use it for screen grab not mood lamp,others
1262,i do not think there is anything wrong with the lights themselves based on the mood lamp you showed at the end of the video my guess would be your configuration needs to be tweaked i use  on my raspberry pi for screen grabbing so my configuration file probably will not be useful for you i would recommend looking at example configurations for whatever software you are using for the lights ,others
1263,they should both work though especially the software made by lightpack that they expect you to use it must be the lights ,brightness
1264,i have been using a red light panel since july for a variety of health reasons but mostly importantly to improve my health in anticipation of eventually catching covid 19 perhaps the most impressive and unexpected benefit i have experienced i gave up my allergy medication i have had terrible allergies since i was a kid i even saw an immunologist in my early 20s that said i was one of the most allergic persons she would ever tested one night over the summer i was experiencing some very itchy eyes i had not used the red light for a couple of days and i had been lazy about taking my antihistamine big mistake since my gf moved in and brought her cat i am very allergic to cats i spent 5 minutes in front of the panel shining red and near infrared light on my face and within 20 minutes the itching had stopped entirely i use the red light every day now and gave up the antihistamine with zero allergy issues fast forward to today i have finally contracted covid i am pretty young 30 so i expected mild symptoms but the only thing i have experienced is the loss of taste and smell no congestion sneezing respiratory symptoms gi problems fatigue nothing my girlfriend who started experiencing symptoms earlier than i and confirmed our affliction with a positive test has had more severe symptoms like congestion sneezing diarrhea and serious fatigue she is resisted my enthusiasm for the red light panel and uses it very rarely i can not for sure chalk up the difference in our symptoms to the red light but i do believe using the red light generally reduces inflammation see allergy results above and therefore the potential damage covid can inflict tl dr red light therapy works for a variety of issues i genuinely believe that existing and emerging research on photobiomodulation will spur a general health revolution and change how people live and work in the coming decades sunlight ultimately powers almost all life on earth ,controller

1288,this is pretty much me you are me same color same everything i did try a sample of the born this way but it was not revolutionary i liked it and i would use it again but i think i would be hard pressed to buy it the nars sheer glow tends to pull a little more yellow so i think it would be alright for summer if you go out a lot but i do not like how it looks i will also say i made the huge mistake of trying the benefit hello flawless in i think the match was i am pure 4 sure what an awful name but it literally came off my face in flakes after only a few hours too ,color

1296,its really interesting to see different opinions i actually got rid of my alp palette after i got the w w because i decided they were too similar in effect to keep both and the color of cabana matched me better than any of the three in the palette anyways i kept ethereal because i like it better than the palette but i do not plan on repurchasing i actually got the w w to use as a setting powder and didnt realize it was a raved about alp dupe until i swatched with my finger and realized i had felt that texture somewhere else before in a much more expensive powder then i went online all excited about my discovery intending to tell other people  only to find that tons of other people had already gotten the memo lol,others
1297,yeah i just could not get on board that train i think there is certain dupes that are passable like this but this is a product that i think you get what you pay for i wish it worked as well as the hg so i could save money but i would rather pay for something i love and will use plus i love the hg packaging and it just makes me feel good ,others

1299,i want to say c1 i do not 100percent remember but looking at n1 it looks too pink so i think it was c1 if we are the same shade i would also recommend asian foundations i match really well with shu uemura and shiseido because they have the right yellow undertones in their foundations i have just never tried out any of their foundations in the long term to recommend them just fyi i am not asian i am a white lady i think my weird undertone has something to do with the fact i am a product of a scottish ginger pink dad and a very olive italian mom ,color

1302,i would say light to medium and it is very buildable i would have got the double wear but there was not a very good colour match,color
1303,they do not offer my shade at shoppers in canada so i checked the website and they have it sometimes they run out but they restock the whole range on their site ,color
1304,oooo so many reccomendations was kinda curious about tarte is rainforest so it is nice to see someone who likes it i really want to try it cosmetics too but i am in canada one day ,others
1305,oh hey thats a golden endorsement for me thanks ,brightness
1306,if another brand is better then name that brand i would love to inspect it is api to see for myself if it is really better ,others
1307,oh the worthless rant posts next ,others
1308, next the newest generation of hue are cri 90 however there is no way to actually select a color temperature from the app the sliders and color wheel do not give you numerical feedback so you can not actually set 2 bulbs to the same setting unless you use presets but even with presets with a sdcm of 6 or 7 there is no way to accurately get 2 bulbs to the same setting you know you can use other apps with hue do not you specifically all4hue allows you to enter a colour temperature from 2000k to 6500k i am guessing that is not going to persuade you though just as your rant is not going to persuade me ,others
1309,what the fuck are you doing to your bulbs that could possibly lead to them getting scratched if you have never bought or used the products it is pretty poor form to comment on the reliability and build quality i have hue bulbs next to each other in the same fixture and to the naked eye the color or temperature difference between them if any is absolutely indistinguishable you would have to use special equipment to see a difference in my opinion ,color
1310,thats any led bulb longevity is not an issue they should last another 6 or so years ,brightness
1311,hey rikuz7 your analysis detailed post is absolutely awesome packed full of info i got into hue thinking i could use the bulbs for home video production but was a little bummed that the gu10 bulbs in particular lacked consistency even among the same series with some shifting to magenta and others to green the e27 bulbs were a lot more consistent though i was using a sekonic color meter to do adjustments but it was a long and arduous process with so many lights in the end i started using a high cri tlci light aputure cob for the main subject the hue for the background color lighting so far so good i do hope philips upgrades the performance of the hue series when it comes to whites as this is where the buzzing flickering low cri rears it is head at the end of the day i think most of us use some temperature of white day to day but this is where the performance of the hue just dies philips makes some awesome bulbs like the master series led is that bring a certain sparkle to your home i just wish they would up the game for hue rgbw maybe ,color
1312,thank you for taking the time to write this and for all the information provided in it i read through your link with the color temperature discussion that is quite interesting i did not know that they do not even use the kelvin scale for the internal algorithms so what about the white ambiance bulbs how are those configured from your link it looks like there is a warm and a cold diode and uses their internal algorithm to output a perceived color temperature without regard to it is numerical kelvin i assume it is the same exact bulb for the white ambiance and color ambiance lines with color controls software disabled in the white ambiance bulbs so for my application i just need white ambiance so the color aspect of these bulbs is useless to me basically i need bulbs to shift color temperature throughout the day going from 6500k to 2200k as the day progresses and i need them to have high cri and be color consistent they will be multifocal use for ambient and task lighting the philips sceneswitch kinda offers this in 5000k and 2700k but the cri is quite low and the light comes out quite harsh i do not like the philips wiz because they work off wifi and that is not really ideal this leaves the hue and the specs they sent back to me were kinda meh which is was led me to create this post i was planning on trying them in bluetooth mode as i only need 2 3 bulbs and do not have any plans to expand from that are you suggesting the bridge is imperative or can some of these 3rd party apps and settings be done with bluetooth setup i also did not particularly want to connect them to my network my equipment is centrally mounted at ceiling height so that is not a problem my concern is more security and privacy do not really want light bulbs pinging home or being a source of entry for anything malicious although i have not looked into this since i only planned on using them as bluetooth since you are probably better familiar with the software than most how secure and private are they if connect with a bridge as far as color consistency that claim is based off  6 7 sdcm is visually perceivable color shift regarding the build quality that is just based off the reviews and feedback i came across while researching them not personal experience frankly i agree i saw a number or references to easy scratching but that seems questionable i usually handle glass bulbs wearing gloves so to avoid oil prints ,color
1313,i will let you know i am still looking through all the brands unfortunately other brands are not disclosing detailed specs either so obtaining the data is the challenge and it seems even philips did not provide me with the correct data based on another comment above ,others
1314,hi what do you think of  they may end up being a bit hard to acquire but seem to fit my use case of wanting shifting color temperatures perfectly and seems to have progressive color temperature options ,color
1315,no i did not know that i am going off the info the philips rep gave me he told me there was no way to control numerically these other apps work with the bridge and bluetooth is there a list not a rant thoughts based on the information i was provided from philips open for discussion ,others
1316,you had just claimed the build quality leads to malfunctioning whatever bye,others
1317,i was refering to the api in my comment as others did as well but you do not react to it which makes me think you do not know what an api is it is a very important part of every serious smart system if there is no api then the system cannot be called smart at best it is wireless then but not smart i bought into philips hue products because of the quality of the api most brands do not even offer an api i have got an awox bulb the quality seems better than philips at first sight but the api is so badly documented that the bulb will probably never be used ,others
1318,patently untrue philips has been a leader in home led lighting from day one even after nearly 7 years no other system really compares in terms of offering a total package of good light quality reliability a complete ecosystem and ease of use there are a ton of third party apps which will put your bulbs at exactly the same setting i would be surprised if 1 person in 10 000 could actually distinguish between two hue bulbs set at the same color side by side i invested in the original philips l prize winning bulbs when they were first released because they were legitimately better in terms of color quality than the other early led is coming out but they clearly took what they learned in designing that bulb and applied it to the rest of their products no they do not build every bulb that strictly anymore but they figured out what actually matters to people and focused on that i have found that the real benefit of hue vs a regular bulb of any sort incandescent cfl led whatever is not only the smart home automation scheduling features but rather that you can adjust the color temperature by time of day matching your home lighting to the ambient surrounding light temperature making the lighting feel much more natural this still is not perfect ideally one would have a sensor that monitored this and adjusted the bulbs automatically but it is far better than having a static light temperature throughout the day or at best a very mild change from warm to very warm a la incandescent bulbs there may be a real specific areas where the hue system does not meet your needs but as a whole system there really is not anything else on the market that comes close ,color
1319,then do not buy them if you think they are cheap and overpriced might i suggest a 2 pack of rgb bluetooth bulbs from amazon even with hue being 3 gens in home automation is still in it is early years get it or do not if you can recommend a better whole home solution i would be happy to listen ,color
1320,the rep you talked to only commented on the official app and experience of the bulbs out of the box however the official philips offerings are very limited compared to the third party apps available the philips app itself does not allow numeric control but the underlying api definitely does and thus there are almost certainly apps out there that can do it i do not use other apps myself preferring to write my own scripts that interact with the api to make my lights do entirely custom things so i can not name any specifically but i can definitely say that when i set bulbs of the same make and model to the same color parameters i cannot tell a meaningful difference in the shade from bulb to bulb at all and i have more or less perfect color vision color consistency really does not seem to be a significan not problem as far as i can tell the only exception might be if you mix bulbs of different generations early hue bulbs were very weak in certain colors so if you mix one with a newer one with the richer colors they will likely look different but among bulbs of the same models which use the same led types as each other even after a couple of years of use mine still seem to be spot on when i switch several to a particular color setting i would definitely recommend looking at the third party apps or even the api itself if you are at all into software development as the potential of the system philips makes available to third party developers is far greater than what their own app provides on its own if you limit yourself to the official app you are missing out on a lot of features and functionality ,color
1321, whatever bye lol malfunction and longevity are two different things ,others
1322,yeah i am seeing the blue boxes too apparently the highlighted comments are ones made since your last visit to the page so essentially new comments you have not iseen philips tells me according to their email that the hue are all cri 90 this seems inline with other bulbs on the market right now ,others
1323,hmm your use case seems to be similar to mine i need lights that will shift color temperature from 6500k to 2200k as the day progresses to keep in line with the ambiance of the surrounding natural light they will be used for ambient and task lighting any advise on how to achieve this setup there is no way to automate this color temperature shift i was thinking about connecting them via bluetooth since i only need 2 3 white ambiance bulbs and do not plan on expanding the system did not necessarily see a need to connect them to my network and am always wary of doing so from a security and privacy standpoint ,color
1324,not a fan of that blue box feature it just appeared suddenly but good to know that it is not a formatting error from my side but everyone sees it differently that is a weird one from philips because if you look at the official site is product specs all i am seeing is cri 80 sure that could still mean that it goes all the way to 90 but usually when a lamp is marked cri 80 it is in the range of 81 89 ,others
1325,so you are not looking for suggestions but you want to discuss how displeased you are with them even though you do not own them i could understand this post if you have a vs situation where you needed advise on one product or another but there is not a competitor feature or price wise for a whole home solution every product falls short for to an enlightened individual in some way but this is a luxury product and has the market cornered ,others
1326,current third party apps operate with the bridge only last i heard philips has decided not to provide any official third party bluetooth support at the moment though i have caught wind of some attempts at reverse engineering the protocol your best bet is probably to get a starter kit with two or three bulbs which includes the bridge since the pricing of the kit bundles is such that the bridge ends up costing very little extra if anything at all compared to buying the bridge and lights separately the bridge itself connects via a wired ethernet cable to your network so your devices and apps can communicate with it and it uses the separate wireless zigbee protocol to pass commands to the lights it does not require an internet connection or cloud account for basic usage the internet connection allows for proper time date scheduling and firmware updates and that plus an account on philips is server enable remote control away from home but these features are optional i can not name any specific apps since i have not messed with them personally though others here should be able to suggest some i am more of a lighting and programming hobbyist enthusiast and like to just write my own little programs to do things i want such as automatic color temperature shifts ,others
1327,i found  last night they have a really wide spectrum and cri 90 looks clean and look like it has automatic color temperature shifting not sure if they have a pubic api though ,color
1328,how might i go about automating color temperature shifts if this is not already a built in function fairly straightforward diy to write your own scripts ,color
1329,ahh yes they do have high cri bulbs but they are in a single temperature another brand i particularly liked was soraa with high cri snap on colour temperature adjustment via filters but not the app controlled changes that you are looking for ,color
1330,here we go the ones i used are not listed but there is now philips master expert color with 97 cri colour consistency of 3 once again like the soraa they are single temp ,color
1331,thanks the ones  range from cri 80 90 with a color consistency of less than 6 but yeah single temperature i am considering just buying a bunch of philips feit and ge smart bulbs and trying them out myself  how did you take these measurements i think i need to get deeper into the data to really understand the product differences ,color
1332,hah that is quite a meter unfortunately not on sale anywhere currently lol the x axis going to a 100 is measuring what cri  and fit my use case perfectly seem a bit hard to acquire though and require 220v ,others
1333,yes the x axis does measure the cri in each of the 15 colours measured in percent and then it gets averaged into one figure wow those lights do seem very capable going up to 16 000k which would look like moonlight ,color
1334,i used the factory connection that was already in place the switch connection in white was different from the aftermarket connection in green so i direct wired the switch into the factory plug ,color

1337,i did not like the iunik propolis serum at all it irritated my skin and made it flush i happen to love the beauty of joseon glow serum tho which is 60percent propolis and 2percent niacinamide it also has a tiny bit of tamanu oil in it,brightness
1338,thank you i will try it out next ,others
1339,i did it was my first propolis product and i really loved it it gave me that coveted propolis glow i do think there are other serums that give you a bit more bang for your buck though namely bonajour propolis serum and the tosowoong sparkle propolis ampoule ,brightness
1340,the second pic is before the third one is after and the fourth one is about 30 mins after  i saw some discussion about the lip care products before  a girl talked about the view 92 products and i do have and am using the product recently lol so i just came to share some of my opinions and hope it will help  the product i bought on amazon is lip toner and also they have lip milk but i do not really know what the difference is between the two products lol hope someone can figure it out and tell me what the difference is haha  okay let is talk about the lip toner  in the second pic you can see that my lips are dry and you can see the lip wrinkles and the dry spot on my lips  after applying the lip toner you can see clearly that it moisturized my lips and make them glossy  that is an immediate effect but i think i have to see if it can maintain for a long time  so i took a picture after 30 mins and you can see thought it is not glossy as before but my lip wrinkles reduced  also the dry spot disappeared  the texture is a little bit sticky but not too heavy and the most important thing is that it does not have strange scent that is one of the reasons that i might recommend this lip toner  it is recommended that apply it twice in the morning and at night  so i think it is not like a lip balm but a toner that you can use in your am and pm routines  btw is there anyone that uses both the lip toner and the lip milk can tell the diffenrence ,others
1341,i really want to try this but it is only available through amazon shipping to my location costs more than the product ,others
