0,I am glad Apple Watch retained the round design. While a redesign could be interesting the current shape lends itself to comfort for all day wear. I was just at the gym a noticed how often my wrists pushed the watch but didn‚Äôt mess with my workout because of the round edges.
1,"[MKBHD's Apple Watch Series 7 Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsosQkfa2L8)

""This watch is basically a Series 6, but with a slightly larger display and slightly faster charge time.""

""This is now the most durable Apple Watch ever.""

""My disappointment with these new watches?  The color choices.  Apple doesn't offer a neutral color for the aluminum baseline Apple Watch."""
2,"It seems like most people who already have an AW are unimpressed by this update, but as somebody who is getting a series 7 as their first smart watch, can I just say I‚Äôm hype as hell for the fast charging and no bezels? I don‚Äôt even mind the colors that much, I went with midnight and I think it looks great"
3,As someone who has a series 1 I‚Äôm definitely pumped! All of the reviews downplay it I think because the reviewers are techies that get review units each year. I will acknowledge I‚Äôm behind and it‚Äôs me that hasn‚Äôt updated. But I feel like we‚Äôre caught up in update culture. Where yes they could add more health features and a few more things but also the changes are so incremental because it‚Äôs such a good device in the first place.
4,"I imagine the space gray aluminum was the single most popular Apple Watch model. Getting rid of it was a pretty naked attempt at trying to force people into a SS or titanium, but I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out."
5,"Basically, it‚Äôs Apple Watch Series 6s?"
6,I am whelmed.
7,Oh man does the green look great. It's a very dark almost army green and looks stunning in the videos. Incredibly happy I went with that over midnight (which looks black with a slight blue at certain angles in direct sunlight).
8,I'm still using Apple Watch 4. No motivation to buy that one. I will wait for a better update.
9,"I will say, seeing videos of the watches in natural light does help - the starlight looks about like how I expected in that champagne kind of color and the midnight and green are both a lot darker than I expected which is a pleasant surprise."
10,"Based on the videos, the midnight looks pretty black at first glance. You see the blue if you look at it carefully/in the right light. Might look different in person."
11,The keyboard is the seller for me
12,"I watched a couple of reviews and cancelled my preorder. Seeing it in real videos now, even with the thinner bezels it still just looks like the same watch which I‚Äôve never loved the design of. My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign, but I still decided to put an order in. But the lack of neutral colours on lower end bands forced me to go for the milanese loop along with the stainless steel to get something I liked the look of, and at that price it simply isn‚Äôt worth it for me. I‚Äôll wait for the series 8 to see if it has the new design and neutral bands."
13,"I have a day one series 3, and I think I might keep hanging on‚Ä¶"
14,"If you have a Series 3 like me and were considering upgrading because of dreadful performance‚Ä¶. I strongly recommend installing watchOS 8.0.1 before ordering a new watch. 

It‚Äôs a major performance improvement and I‚Äôm now thinking of hanging on to this S3 for a little longer."
15,Waiting for another 38mm model. Or 36 w a full screen. These are just too bulky.
16,"Anyone who says this is an ‚ÄúS‚Äù year really doesn‚Äôt get how S models work.

The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is the literal opposite of an S year."
17,I DEMAND 120hz!!!
18,Even with these minor updates since last 2-3 years. AW is the best smartwatch and there is nothing even close. Shows you how other companies are far behind in the competition.
19,I wonder if it still works with the Belkin 3-in-1 Magsafe dock
20,"I‚Äôm debating on canceling my preorder after seeing these reviews. I‚Äôd be upgrading from a day one Series 4 with 80% battery health. 

I mainly upgraded so that I can have a good battery life again, get AOD and blood oxygen sensor. 

I‚Äôm seriously thinking of just getting a battery replacement and call it a year. It also doesn‚Äôt help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS."
21,I have a space gray S4. I was considering going to the S7 but no way am I paying for $800 for Space Black Titanium. Tim Apple has let me down on this one
22,"As an owner of a Series 6 Nike Edition watch, I'll be holding out for the future release that includes a blood glucose sensor.      With the cost of the sensors that you can wear for 14 days of continuous blood glucose monitoring, the Apple Watch series that does that feature will be well worth the upgrade."
23,Looks like I‚Äôm sticking with my series 1 for the time being üòÖ
24,"It's bizarre to me how much complaining there is about the Starlight and Midnight color options in this thread for a few reasons:

1) They're still super close to Silver and Space Grey. A hint of gold or blue does not make them ""not neutral,"" and anybody who isn't up on Apple color conventions is still going to look at them and think they look silver or dark grey. 

2) Why does it matter if they're neutral in the first place? You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. No, the Space Black Ti model is not going to look more professional/less gadgety than the Midnight Al."
25,Did anybody get the Gold SS (or any SS) review models?
26,No hands on with the blue?
27,Is the fast charging exclusive to the 7 or can I now buy a fast charger for my SE? Every once in a while I have my head up my ass ass and forget to charge when I have a good opportunity.
28,"I wonder if Apple will ever update the aluminum version of the apple watch with a sapphire display. My series 3 aluminum face is scratched to hell, but the massive increase in price to the steel/ceramic/titanium just seems not worth it."
29,"This is the 2nd apple device that I may upgrade too only because I regret my previous purchase. 


I got the iPhone 13 pro only because I regret getting the iPhone 12 with no telephoto lens, and I might get the series 7 only because I regret getting the SE with no always on display. Neither seem like enticing options if I made the correct choice with the 12 pro/series 6 last year."
30,so the s7 SiP is the same as the s6 SiP???
31,"I ordered one because It‚Äôs more trouble to buy a cheaper 6 from going to another country rather than get the 7 delivered to my door. 

First AW btw. I‚Äôve only used it briefly for a week because a friend borrowed it to me so I can get a reference to compare it to the gwa2 I had."
32,I‚Äôm excited for my watch coming this Friday. Going to be upgrading from a Series 1!
33,Have a stainless with Milanese loop 45mm coming as my first Apple Watch. I‚Äôm very excited!! I don‚Äôt know too much about the features which makes me even more excited!
34,My new 7 is taking forever to charge and doesn‚Äôt hold a charge.  What chargers is everyone using and how long to charge?  15 mins?!  I wish!
35,So that whole announcement about it having really durable crystal across the board was a lie and it‚Äôs just glass and crystal on the stainless still?
36,"Well the hands on real world footage has shown clearly what I was worried about

The screen going so far edge to edge with such a curvy bit of glass looks weird

Looks to me like the screen is too big for the watch. The way the reflective edge obscures the display just doesn‚Äôt look all that great

The display no longer looks like its on top of the glass, it looks like its trapped behind the glass

And now I‚Äôm convinced that this will look great with a flatter redesign that I suspect we will get next year (if it wasn‚Äôt originally planned for this year)"
37,"I mean just get a Series 6 which will probably discounted by retailers or off eBay. I got a series 5 stainless steel in January, heavily discounted and can see myself holding onto this for a while"
38,"Yeh I also thought this with the ‚Äúleaked‚Äù design, them squared edges don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôll be too nice when bending my wrist. And yes before anyone mentions it, I know traditional, analog can watches have squared edges and are bulky"
39,I don‚Äôt see them doing a flat design any time soon. The sensors would need to be completely redesigned to accommodate it. As it stands they protrude out the back of the watch significantly. They get away with it in part because of the curvature of the watch.
40,"The fifteen minutes of charging for 8 hours of sleep tracking does sound really nice, as I use my watch as a sleep tracker / alarm clock. Definitely feeling the upgrade pull from a series 3 to 7."
41,This is a good summary. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶basically it for changes.
42,"Coming from a wifi only Series 4, it‚Äôs a slightly better upgrade to the 7 cellular. Other than going for walks without my phone with me now, I doubt I‚Äôm going to be using it any differently."
43,Did I miss an incredibly small one-liner or did he not even address battery life?
44,"Seems marques has been getting sloppy with the fact checking. He mentions you can dive with the watch because it has 5ATM water resistance.

Do NOT dive with it. I wouldn‚Äôt even use it for water sports like surfing. 5ATM basically allows for swimming in a pool and showering, doing more is risking it. If you want to do snorkeling you need at least 10ATM and for skin diving it should be 20ATM. 

Free and scuba diving are another beast and those watches need to pass a different certification (ISO 6425) so they are advertised with the word Diver‚Äôs before the rating."
45,Since when aren‚Äôt black and silver neutral colours?
46,"You‚Äôre definitely part of the target audience for the Series 7. I think people forget that for anyone thinking about upgrading from a Series 4 or older, this is a pretty significant upgrade."
47,Exactly the same here!
48,Same here! My first one. I'm only bummed by the removing of space grey color but i'll live with the midnight
49,"Very excited here as well! I am upgrading from an OG Galaxy Watch. I was a recent Android convert, and this will be my first Apple Watch. 

Looking forward to the integration and overall polish, as that was dearly lacking on the OG Galaxy Watch."
50,"I‚Äôm excited for mine, finally broke my series 2 a couple weeks ago"
51,">no bezels

It's not like the Series 4, 5, SE, or 6 had much of a bezel to begin with."
52,"It's just like phones - it's an incremental upgrade from the previous generation, but it's really aimed at people who haven't upgraded for 2+ years.  For them, it's a large jump."
53,I mean I‚Äôm hyped as well upgrading from a Series 0 lmao‚Ä¶
54,"Yeah, I'm digging that midnight. Waiting for mine to arrive.

Up to everyone's taste ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
55,"Same here, I think all the people with recent watches are missing the point. The tech is mature enough that upgrading every year or two is pointless and wasteful."
56,You should see the screenshots and texts between me and my buddy.  We are very excited for midnight
57,Basically the Verge‚Äôs video conclusion lmao.
58,I‚Äôll be coming form a S4. So there‚Äôs some new shit for me.
59,Your hype is totally justified! I jumped on the AW train last year with the S6 which was similarly received and I felt just as you described. I hope you love your new S7!
60,I wonder if they‚Äôll also phase out silver and space grey on the new MacBooks (in favour of Starlight and Midnight). Currently I don‚Äôt think any of the recently refreshed products have any silver/space grey aluminum which is a bit odd.
61,"Removing neutral colors (black and white) from the base iPhone 13 lineup this year didn‚Äôt seem to slow down sales, even though they were probably the most popular colors."
62,"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve calculated these losses go one they didn‚Äôt even need to build a new chipset. This, internally, is the same processor then the S6. That‚Äôs where most of the money in R&D goes, and they didn‚Äôt need to spend a single dollar this year on making it better."
63,"The only reason I bought a model other than the aluminum was for the sapphire screen. In hindsight, it was worth it, but I wish they would let all models have the sapphire rather than just the premium"
64,"> I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out  

Yeah right now I'm waiting to see if any S6 deals are on the go (UK) or go cheapsies on the SE. Was more than happy to go in on the big new thing but what a jip.  

Edit: None have seemingly dropped from the current price that I've seen yet but likely will once they get S7 stock..."
65,"probably. i know i have no interest in buying a *heavier* and less shatter/crack resistant Watch just to get a color i like when that Watch is also more expensive and whose main purpose is fitness tracking.

but also, the only reason i'd replace my Series 5 with a 7 is if the battery degrades sufficiently to bug me and i can't wait for a Series 8 or whatever. there's just not anything exciting about the 7 to me."
66,"I'm sure you're right, but I'm still using a Series 4 and I have to say the improvements on the Series 7 seemed like a good enough jump for me.  Nicer/more durable screen, fast charging, and brighter always on display (which I have yet to experience on an Apple Watch) sold me on it.  

They didn't have the exact color I wanted, but for me the hardware updates and features matter more"
67,"Of the three people who I know who have apple watches, they‚Äôre all getting midnight and are excited after todays pics and videos"
68,I doubt it. Some of these colors are REALLY neutral. Heck apparently the very green one is more or less gray in anything but ideal lighting.
69,Don‚Äôt think apple will ever bring space Grey back for any of their products. It‚Äôll be more of graphite. A darker shade. I‚Äôll expect MacBook Pro to follow suit. Basically all of the pro products will have similar colour range. AW SS imo falls under the pro range
70,4s^3
71,"Ehh I'd only expect spec bumps for an S. 20% larger screen, faster charging but no spec bump is... it's own minor thing."
72,and it's not like the Series 6 was anything more than a Series 5 with a gimmicky Spo2 sensor.
73,"No. S years are by definition the same external design and more major internal improvements. 

The Series 7 is the opposite of this: new external design and lesser overall improvements."
74,"Given the iPhone 6S was one of the most comprehensive internal revamps of all time, not exactly relevant."
75,This is definitely one of the Apple Watches ever released
76,"Same here. I can‚Äôt figure out why the green isn‚Äôt more popular. I got the clover solo loop but man, the black bands paired with the green watch sure look great."
77,"I wasn‚Äôt complaining, I missed preorder by far, but green was still available for day 1 store pickup by midday."
78,What‚Äôs the battery health on your S4?
79,I‚Äôm definitely getting the series 8 if my watch makes it to then.
80,I broke my Apple Watch 4 a couple months ago and have no motivation to buy this. The incremental watch updates are killing me.
81,"I‚Äôm totally happy with the physical design of it, but there‚Äôs nothing this year that makes it a worthwhile upgrade. For me, the two biggest things that I‚Äôd be excited for are either a significant upgrade to battery life, or some new health-tracking features enabled by new hardware. Anything else is kinda ‚Äúwell I guess a slightly larger screen is nice but not $400 nice‚Äù."
82,"> My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign

I just cannot understand the logic behind wanting redesigns on things just for the sake of having them redesigned... It's a smart watch with an extremely limited form factor, what are you expecting? Will square sides chuff your bits?"
83,Hard edge Apple Watch would suck for working out / sports
84,"Same, cancelled and ordered couple new bands instead to clench that consumer thirst"
85,"Series 3 gang üòé I‚Äôll be honest I haven‚Äôt really been tempted by any of the EKG or blood O2 stuff in the new ones, seem kinda gimmicky. I think I‚Äôll be rocking the 3 for a while"
86,Same
87,"Same. When this was announced I was all in. Then as time went on, the shiny idea went away and my s3 still does what I need and doesn‚Äôt cost me $800. Gonna use that to replace my aging iMac"
88,Yeah I agree. I cleared everything and installed 8.0.1 and it feels like a new watch somehow. I‚Äôm still going to check out my ss series 7 when it comes in for a week then make my decision.
89,"> The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is not the official definition though. And no one is calling it the ""S"" model like it is an official thing. 

> This is the literal opposite of an S year.

The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature. None of those really apply here."
90,‚Äú but I need something new and drastic every year!!!!!!‚Äù
91,I think all of us that use an analog watch face agree that its ridiculous that we don't have 120Hz or higher yet. Watching the second hand move on my current Apple watch only compels me to stab my eyes out with an Apple Pencil.
92,It does it just doesn‚Äôt fast charge.
93,"If you‚Äôre able to, couldn‚Äôt you get a Series 6? I just got one, it‚Äôs a great device and one that could last me a few generations. I imagine the series 6 will do the same for you."
94,Same boat as you. Might end up canceling my preorder as well.
95,"As I have a series 4, I cancelled my series 7 pre-order that would have been arriving this Friday. I think I can be patient enough for another few generations."
96,"I had a steel Series 4 with 75% battery health, and right after the Series 7 was announced I was on the phone with Apple to get a battery replacement.

Now I‚Äôve got a Series 4 with a fresh battery that looks brand new (so shiny without all the scratches!) and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my decision.

I‚Äôll probably upgrade next year if the Series 8 gets those rumoured new health sensors. AOD would be cool too."
97,">It also doesn‚Äôt help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS

From what I've seen the reviews, Midnight honestly [looks closer to black](https://i.redd.it/xc3cprrt19t71.jpg) than Space Gray ever did. It has a slight blue sheen in certain lighting, but it's super subtle to the point where black bands match it better than the Midnight ones.

It's almost making me regret getting black Ti, but I still think that also looks great so I'm going to keep it for now."
98,I mean the ‚Äúgraphite‚Äù stainless steel model seems pretty black to me
99,‚Ä¶so get aluminum‚Ä¶?
100,what would they have to add to entice you? curious
101,"Fair play. I went from S1 to S4 and it was a big jump, but every year since has been underwhelming. 

Not that I know what I want from a smart watch these days. Maybe just battery, everything is fine."
102,"> You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. 

I don't think the problem is embracing whether they are trying to hide the fact that they have an Apple Watch or not. The problem is how well the colors go with your bands, outfits, and ""lifestyle"". A neutral watch is likely to blend with their choices. 

A red Apple Watch will not go with how I dress for work, or socially. It won't even match half the bands I bought for my space gray watch. So while I really like the color, I won't get that color."
103,">	Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like.

The colour that I like is no longer available. That‚Äôs the problem."
104,"I think this is just all wild speculative whining driven by the absence of being able to hold a watch in your hand and having to go by product images online. As soon as they're released, I expect very few actual complaints in real world use.

I've been a participant in this before: When every Apple 'news' site broadcasted that the MagSafe Duo was possibly incompatible with the iPhone 13 Pro I was aghast and fretting over it. Only to receive the phone and charge it every night on it without any issue. Not exactly the same, but its no point in getting so worked up over something until you actually have it in your hand."
105,It looks like everyone has been getting the green one for their reviews so far.
106,"Yep, 7 only"
107,The sapphire is more scratch resistant but also heavier and more brittle (prone to shattering). The ion-glass is much better for the ‚Äúsports/fitness‚Äù model.
108,"I know it adds a little bulk, but the there are so many bumper styles out for for super cheap.  I‚Äôd highly recommend; they‚Äôve saved my A3 on dozens of occasions."
109,Yes
110,"I agree it looked that way, but if you take a close look at the watch when it's on your wrist, it's really the sensor on the bottom that has contact on your skin, not the edges of the watch. In fact, short of bending my wrist straight up, I can't even get myself to contact the sides.  That's just to say that I think the more angular design wouldn't be an issue in practice."
111,"Oh if you have a series 3 there‚Äôs no question you should upgrade. 

Also Tommy rules!"
112,"True, but saying only ‚Äúslightly larger display‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really imply the functional upgrade of the revised UI to go with it that can show 50% more text on screen, and has a keyboard etc.

For me, being able to read messages/emails that are 50% longer without having to bring up my other hand to scroll through them is a pretty important upgrade."
113,I was looking forward to more. Series 8?
114,"He did address battery life, it‚Äôs the same."
115,He mentions battery life in the video.
116,"he addressed on battery and recharge 

while battery life is the same. quick charge fits his life style much better"
117,"there's not anything new there really. battery life is the same as it's always been ('fine' to 'mediocre' depending on how you use the Watch), but it charges faster so you can just do a quick charge at night or in the morning if you find some benefit to sleep tracking and be fine."
118,Also watch your bands. I used a sports band and jumped off a rock about 10 feet up and lost my watch on impact (on the second jump). The river was not clear and it was lost forever.
119,There is no black aluminum. The midnight version has a blue tint to it.
120,[deleted]
121,"Coming from a SS series 4, I‚Äôm pretty excited for the upgrade."
122,"This!
I‚Äôve got a 3, so this would be a gigantic upgrade. Wouldn‚Äôt be bummed at all."
123,"Exact same as you, going to try and order friday since I missed preorder timeline for friday pickup"
124,Same I‚Äôm excited - also getting my first cellular model
125,"Oddly, the new iPad mini has Starlight and Space Grey."
126,"I doubt they'd do that. Maybe we'll see MacBooks come in color options similar to the iMacs, but I don't think they're going to release new colorways to match watches. The watch is unique among Apple offerings because it's a fashion accessory as much as it is a tech product. The people who think all Apple products should be color-matched are looking at it the wrong way, imo. The watches need to be matched with clothing, not MacBooks."
127,"At least you can (and most likely do) put a cover on a phone, with the watch you're stuck with what you've got."
128,"For me the color matters much more for a watch than a phone. You‚Äôre likely not putting a case on it, and it‚Äôs part of your outfit."
129,"If it‚Äôs about the durability of the display, I‚Äôve been buying some cheap glass screen protectors for my aluminum AWS6 from AliExpress that use LOCA and a UV light. Very sleek and since it‚Äôs glass I‚Äôve found I don‚Äôt notice it if you put it on right.

Obviously not as premium as sapphire crystal, but my wrist is at the perfect height to bang into doorknobs and my quartz countertops - sometimes it‚Äôll crack but then I just replace the protector. Could be an option for people more budget -minded (read: cheap) like myself lol"
130,I‚Äôn from NL and found a 40mm Series 6 on Amazon for 299 a few weeks ago. That was enough reason for me the take the S6 and not wait for the S7. Best choice ever after seeing these reviews.
131,"4s^3 is impossible, it should be 4s^2 3d^1"
132,Apple Watch Series 6 Pro Max
133,">I can‚Äôt figure out why the green isn‚Äôt more popular

The answer to the question ""Why isn't x color more popular"" when it comes to fashion accessories is pretty simple. Most colors outside of black, white, gold, and brown just don't go together nicely with most people's clothing choices, and this green color on the Series 7 looks like it unfortunately falls into that camp.

Never mind the fact that conventional mechanical watches are almost always found in those colors as well."
134,"I went in 50/50 between green and midnight but I ended up looking in my closet to make up my mind. The green would work with my weekend clothes but it‚Äôs just not right for my black, blue, and gray heavy business attire, and (rather unfortunately) I‚Äôm in the business clothes many more hours than my casual clothes during the Monday through Friday time period when I‚Äôll actually need to use a watch. Still would have preferred graphite to match my 13 Pro but I‚Äôm staying open minded about the midnight."
135,My S4 that I got replaced in Feb 2019 is at 85%
136,How about 400 minus what you get from selling your 6 ?
137,I‚Äôm with you.  Plus I don‚Äôt want a mini iPhone looking thing on my wrist.  The current Apple Watch looks amazing and does not need a redesign
138,"The only way to chuff my bits is by putting the apple watch inside the seiko 5, sorry not sorry"
139,"It‚Äôs important to me that it looks good, and for me the rumoured redesign was a significant aesthetic improvement over the current design."
140,"I‚Äôm on an s4 so I have those, and yeah, totally minor things. The only reason I‚Äôm even entertaining updating is I‚Äôve been dying for the always on screen, and my watch is getting fairly beat up after years of daily use‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt like the colors of the aluminum and would never go to the stainless, and the idea of buying last years product when it‚Äôs still so expensive just seems wrong to me.

I really wanted to upgrade, but everything about this watch feels like a minor revision, and that they plan for something much more significant next year. And if not, well, we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶"
141,">The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature.

TouchID was a pretty valuable feature. And as far as redesigns go, it's S7 is probably more substantial than going from iPhone 6S to 7 was. Same with XS to 11."
142,"Not saying it‚Äôs a definition, but that‚Äôs always how S models worked.

3GS identical to 3G
4S identical to 4
5s near identical to 5, with home button changed for Touch ID 
6s identical to 6
XS identical to X

It would make more sense to call the S6 ‚ÄúSeries 5s‚Äù than to call Series 7 a ‚ÄúSeries 6s‚Äù"
143,"Gotcha, thanks! It wasn‚Äôt listed underneath the dock‚Äôs compatibility section on Belkin‚Äôs website and I saw a post on here a few weeks ago inquiring the same thing"
144,I might just get a Stainless Steel Series 6 to be honest. Good idea!
145,What's the price diff?
146,Did they replace the screen too when you got the battery replaced or have you just taken really good care of yours? I'm debating cancelling my order but the scratch in my series 4 has been bothering me for a couple years now and going to the sapphire glass would be nice.
147,"It‚Äôs black enough to me 

https://forums.macrumors.com/attachments/5-graphite-spaceblack-2-rp-jpg.957384/"
148,"It‚Äôs not, I got a graphite S6 last year before returning it and it‚Äôs very dark gray and not black."
149,"Im not really sure, it‚Äôs just that my current watch is still doing it job as a fitness tracker. It‚Äôs slow as shit but does the job."
150,[deleted]
151,"Agree on red, but I really don't think space grey to midnight is a huge shift, and silver to starlight is even less so. I'd love to see an example of an outfit or band that goes with space grey but not with midnight."
152,"Fair, but I‚Äôve seen a lot of comments that are not about not liking any of the colors but that somehow only silver or grey is acceptable for a watch."

157,"Apple Watch is pretty mature now. I don‚Äôt see any big hardware changes that are possible in the next year or two. The most highly hyped wish, blood pressure/sugar sensor, is either waaaay not ready in an accurate manner or a gimmick for most users."
158,"The watch is really seeming like something worth upgrading every 3-4 years, which is perfectly fine. If you‚Äôre got Series 4 or better you‚Äôre not missing much on upgrades yet."
159,BRO! This same thing just happened to me two weeks ago in Florida. So freaking mad about that
160,It‚Äôs black. If there‚Äôs any tint to it you‚Äôd have to have it next to your face to see it. In any case it‚Äôs one of two neutral colours available
161,They‚Äôre both neutral colours. They might be slightly off but it‚Äôs something you have to look at
162,"Ahh, I pre ordered within the hour of pre orders and have a delivery date of Oct 25-Nov 1st üôÉ

Could be worse I guess!"

173,The Apple Watch is already pretty rectangly.  You want it even more of a rectangle?
174,How exactly does the current design look bad though? Apple Watches have reached a point of ubiquity where lots of people wear them in all sorts of circumstances and don't really stand out because they have a square smartwatch on their wrist.
175,Yeah the series 7 is 1000% an upgrade but I can‚Äôt justify paying $400 when my 3 works so well. I really just use it for the gym anyway. I say wait but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be happy with either one bro

178,"So basically you're saying, the outer material of the watch is more of a priority than stuff like fast charging and a larger screen?

Since you're willing to pay *more* for a used watch with less features, just due to the material being more premium.

EDIT: This wasn't a rhetorical questions. I was just curious if stainless steel was truly a priority for them over the new features (and over getting a new watch w/ a warranty and fresh battery)."

181,"Lmao I felt this. But I bit the bullet. I wanted the bigger screen and to be able to idk‚Äîopen settings without a spinning wait logo haha.

Tbh I think I‚Äôve been really holding out because of the rumour mill. I keep hearing about groundbreaking features like glucose monitoring, redesigns etc. So when I heard the announcement I was like, welp.

But on the other hand. All the excitement behind the last 5 updates all come at once now so I‚Äôm still pretty hyped!

Edit: I meant to also add. It‚Äôs the software non compatibility for me. Having a work focus turn on, on my phone, and receiving zero work notifs on my watch is not a mood. Plus a few other things as I‚Äôm now like 2 software cycles behind haha"
182,"Always on display with S5 is the biggest upgrade they‚Äôve ever done in my opinion, once you have it there is no going back"
183,S5 added the always on screen didn't it? I have the S4 and that's the only reason I see to upgrade
184,Yeah it's hard to imagine [this](https://i.redd.it/xc3cprrt19t71.jpg) having making a significant difference to what people can wear it with. I honestly think most people would just assume it's black.
185,"I don't think the issue with midnight and starlight is that they're so different from space grey/silver so as to be unusable. It's more just that they're less than ideal in many people's eyes compared to the more standard colors. And when upgrading to a new watch, a slightly underwhelming color option isn't really the concern one should have."
186,"I‚Äôm upgrading from a 4. My problem is I was in afib a few weeks ago. It alerted me. But to manually launch a test while the heart rate above 100 offered fast too many ‚ÄúInconclusive‚Äù results. I know that the earlier models cut off somewhere between 100-120 on accuracy for detecting. 
So I‚Äôll take more accurate results and a bonus screen bump. If it wasn‚Äôt for medical, I may have waited."
187,I went from S0 to S4. I don‚Äôt think the upgrade from S4 to S7 is worth it. Thoughts?
188,"for real, at no point ever I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôd benefit from a bigger and I have a 40mm SE.

it could be nice if you have large wrists but for me it‚Äôs the perfect size and fit."
189,">and discovered that you could read a whole 1.5 more lines of a text message.

I'd be curious to see that link, but the difference seems pretty obvious just based on [the comparison photo](https://imgur.com/a/OtCK0He) that they showed. It appears to be more like 2.66 more lines of text based on that, which on the older smaller screen would equate to probably around 4-5 more lines. Since I often have to scroll just to see a couple more words, to me this will be pretty useful.

>To me, that's hardly ""50% better"" or worth the cost of upgrading.

Yeah I mean a lot of it comes down to how old your current model is. I am on a Series 4 so it would be nice to get the new sensors, always on display and fast charging. I never claimed it was 50% ""better"" than the old models though."
190,">If it‚Äôs a long text I‚Äôm probably still gunna have to scroll,

For me a lot of times I just need to read a few more words after scrolling, so displaying an extra few lines of text would probably be pretty useful.

I don't usually respond on my watch in most cases though (I use it mostly for receiving work notifications) so I'm personally not too concerned about getting to the actions."
191,Because Next year I want a caffeine drip‚Ä¶
192,"There's significant room for growth in their sleep tracking. I think that's the big area where we'll see improvement in the next few series. Aside from that, they are legitimately due for a major redesign like the leaks suggested. Not because it's necessary so much as just because products this late in their life cycle typically have multiple visual overhauls and the apple watch has been pretty stagnant."
193,"The reason it's so difficult to gauge with the watch is that it's really a product that is more than the sum of its parts. I remember jumping from the 3 to the 5 thinking that the latter wasn't all that different, and yet when I actually got the 5 I realized that the small changes made the whole experience just flow so much better. I'm *hoping* the 7 has a similar improved ""feel"" to the experience. But I do admit on paper it's a massively disappointing upgrade."
194,"There is absolutely a blue tint. Not a huge blue tint, but it's there and enough for many to consider it not a neutral color."
195,But it's not black...? It very clearly has blue in it. Re-calibrate your monitor my dude
196,I can see the blue tint in the images on the Apple site.
197,">UrAvgConsumer - Apple Watch Series 7 Unboxing & Hands On!

Except for the fact that it's blue, and Starlight is cream."

199,"The specific one I last ordered from was this one, but I've ordered from a few different vendors and they all seem to be the same: [3D Curved Full Cover Film For Apple Watch Series SE 6 4 5 40mm 44mm Screen Protector Full Glue UV Glass for Series 1 2 3 38 42mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000404989674.html)

But if you search ""Apple Watch UV Glass"" you'll get a few hits, sort by # orders and the ones you want will usually have a picture of little UV light in the product picture. I find the LOCA glue+UV ones fit better without bubbling, especially considering the curved glass.

A few tips: it's a little tricky at first but just watch a youtube video on how to do it, and tape over the rest of the watch in case you put too much glue. Easy to clean though if you do make a mess. Also I'd suggest just buying a few and springing the extra couple dollars for the EMS e-packet or AliExpress standard shipping."
200,That‚Äôs true **courage** considering that element would surely blow up in their face
201,How do you check the health?
202,Wear it in good health my friend!

204,"> the outer material of the watch is more of a priority than stuff like fast charging and a larger screen?

No, my priorities are valuable features. Fast charging and 20% larger screen aren't a priority for *me*. 

I'm ready to drop $450 for an upgrade. I could either:

- Pay $450 for an Aluminum Apple Watch (Series 7)

or

- Pay $450 for an Stainless Steel Apple Watch (Series 6)

If I'm spending $450 for the upgrade, I might as well just go for the premium material if I don't care for the Series 7."
205,"Yeah, they don‚Äôt repair watches. They just replace them."
206,">for me it‚Äôs the perfect size and fit.

The size and fit hasn't really changed much with S7 (only by 1mm). I was referring to the extra room for text and revamped UI from the new version as being a benefit. Not the larger physical size."
207,"Kind of disingenuous on Apple‚Äôs behalf here, the spacing on the words and letters is completely different between the two."
208,"Just so you know, every word in that entire text is strategically chosen so that words ending a line would be too long for AW6 for fit perfectly for AW7."
209,"I am currently using a Series 6, but upgraded to that this year from an aging Series 4. The screen differences between the 4-6 models and the 7 are getting pretty overblown by most people, that's all I am saying.

>the functional upgrade of the revised UI to go with it that can show 50% more text on screen, and has a keyboard etc.

The same keyboard Apple stole from a third party developer?"
210,Looks grey to me my dude
211,On your Apple Watch go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health.
212,But those aren‚Äôt on your wrist.   Wasn‚Äôt a big complaint of the Apple Watch being that it wasn‚Äôt a circle?
213,">No, my priorities are valuable features. Fast charging and 20% larger screen aren't a priority for me

That's... exactly what I just said above - that the outer material of the watch is more of a priority than fast charging and the larger screen w/ a revamped UI. I was mostly just curious.

>I'm ready to drop $450 for an upgrade. I could either:Pay $450 for an Aluminum Apple Watch (Series 7) orPay $450 for an Stainless Steel Apple Watch (Series 6)

Fair enough! Worth mentioning that one of these options is used though and probably won't come with the same warranty and might not be in the same condition or have the same battery health. But I do agree that buying used previous-gen electronics will get generally be a better value than buying something that just came out."
214,"yes i‚Äôm speaking about the screen size, sorry if I wasn‚Äôt clear"
215,The case size hasn't changed much for the 45mm it only got a mm taller. The 41mm case is a mm taller and wider.
216,"I believe that's just how it looks on a 40mm screen - the longer words are forced down to the next line because there isn't enough room in the right margin to fit them. It does seem like they could make the whole text bubble wider though, on both models."
217,">The same keyboard Apple stole from a third party developer?

I guess? Seems like it would be hard to know if Apple had been working on their own keyboard or if they literally just ""stole"" one. I do agree that it was a dick move to force them to delist that app though.

Also not sure what that has to do with if the Series 7 is worth it or not.

EDIT: Funny that this is such a controversial comment.  I'm not even saying they didn't steal it - it just seems like this sort of thing requires proof to be certain.  And do people really believe that Apple *wasn't* ever working on their own watch keyboard all these years?"
218,...what? How did you stray even further from the actual color? lol
219,"Congratulations, you'er colorblind."
220,Oh duh - same way you check the phone haha. Thank you. Also I got mine day 1 and it‚Äôs also 81%
221,A circle would be even better. But flat edges on the current design would be better than what we have now IMO.
222,"All that's really changed with the screen size is that they made the bezels smaller, so I'm not really sure how that would affect the ""fit"" one way or another.

In most instances it will look pretty much the same as before since the edge of the screen is just black more often than not (like with a lot of faces and 100% of the time when the always-on display is on)."
223,"Nah ignore the text bubble, look at the spacing between lines of text, it‚Äôs much tighter on the S7"
224,Off of apples own website on their display with true time off?
225,Mines 79. I‚Äôve decided to get the new watch mainly because of the AoD.
226,"Ah, I see what you mean. But I'm not sure if that's disingenuous unless it's a doctored photo and not how it actually appears. It does seem like they could reduce that on the S6 though, assuming it is accurate."
227,Just to clarify: you think the midnight color looks grey? First you said it was black and now grey? What is going on
228,"I mean it‚Äôs disingenuous since they‚Äôre acting like that benefit is entirely down to the bigger screen, and not also because they tweaked line spacing to fit more content in there, which they can also do on the other watches"
229,"Apple hasn‚Äôt made a actually black anything in a while. It‚Äôs always grey. They made a jet black iPhone 7 but that‚Äôs pretty much it. It‚Äôs been space grey, graphite or midnight. All slightly different shades of grey. Calling it black is just easier."
230,">they‚Äôre acting like that benefit is entirely down to the bigger screen, and not also because they tweaked line spacing to fit more content in there

I mean they were pretty clear that the extra room for text was the result of the UI being redesigned, not *just* because the screen is larger. They had a whole section of the presentation dedicated to that UI redesign.

I also kind of doubt that the reason they didn't cram more text in before was simply to sell us on a larger screen 3 years later. 

And even if they made the line heights identical here that would only probably allow another half line of text or something, which wouldn't exactly be a major difference if it was cropped."
231,"Okay but I feel like we're drifting away from the point of this: midnight is not black, nor grey."
232,It‚Äôs grey. Ask most people and they‚Äôll say grey
233,"Our eyes must work different ways. [Here's a comparison](https://i.imgur.com/QmpP1i5.jpg)

To confirm: You believe the watch on the right (AW7 Midnight) is the same color as the one on the left (AW6 SPACE GRAY)?"
234,It‚Äôs definitely not grey.
235,Just different shades of grey
236,And you have a drivers license. Jesus Christ.

What is most important to you in a smartwatch?

Sure, the top-of-the-line Apple Watch Series 6 can do that stuff but so can models that cost far less.

If you have already got a two- or three-year-old Apple Watch, the gains with this new model aren‚Äôt substantial. Same screen, same battery life, same core functionality. And I found this year‚Äôs standout health feature‚Äîa blood-oxygen sensor‚Äînot ready for prime time, not to mention not useful.

Plus, if you‚Äôre a first timer, or in need of an upgrade, Apple now has two other lower-cost options: the Apple Watch SE and Series 3. Actually, make that three: The best deal going right now might be a refurbished Series 5.

It is OK to be confused. I‚Äôm here for you. After testing all the models last week‚Äîalong with the $330 Fitbit FIT 0.23% Sense‚ÄîI have arrived at a new theory of Watch-Nomics: You should upgrade your Apple Watch every three to five years. Any sooner, and spending more on a watch doesn‚Äôt mean proportionally more features. So make the call on your needed features, then make a purchase.

The Choices

Remember your SAT multiple-choice tactics? Eliminate two choices and you suddenly have a 50/50 shot at a correct pick. Buying an Apple Watch is like that:


Do not collect them all! The Apple Watch Series 3, SE and Series 6, all on one wrist, from left to right.
A) Apple Watch Series 6 ($399): This one has the larger screen introduced in 2018, with an always-on display showing the time. It now has a slightly faster processor, slightly faster charging and the full health package, including an ECG electrical heart-rate sensor and new blood-oxygen sensor.

B) Refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 ($329): It‚Äôs basically a Series 6 without the blood-oxygen sensor. Apple stopped marketing it, but at time of publication, you could still find some variations in its refurbished store.

C) Apple Watch Series SE ($279): This resembles a Series 5 or 6, but without the always-on display, ECG or blood-oxygen sensor. It still has heart-rate tracking and notifications for high, low and irregular heart rate, as well as fall detection.

D) Apple Watch Series 3 ($199): OK, almost there. This one has an older design with a smaller screen, slightly shorter battery life and slower performance. It also has heart-rate tracking and heart-rate notifications, but no fall detection.

The Features

I anticipate most will choose A or C, especially if Apple runs out of refurbished Series 5s. So the real question is this: Are a blood-oxygen sensor, an ECG and an always-on display worth $120?

When I got the blood-oxygen sensor to work, most of my readings were in the healthy high-90% range. During a visit to my doctor, the watch even compared point for point with a medical-grade vital-signs monitor. However, often when I would manually initiate the 15-second test, I would get an ‚ÄúUnsuccessful Measurement,‚Äù indicating that the test didn‚Äôt work. Sometimes I would get a lower reading, like 94%‚Äîeven when my trusty $45 Walgreen‚Äôs pulse oximeter said 99%.

The little disco ball of green and red lights on the back of the watch needs to be steady, flush and tight against the skin to get a reading. The new, wonderfully comfortable Solo Loop straps help with that, but apparently mine was a bit too loose. Sliding the watch up my wrist a bit more has improved this. Still, using this is far too unreliable and inaccurate‚Äîeven if Apple doesn‚Äôt suggest this for medical use.


The Series 6 measures blood-oxygen levels, though not as reliably as a dedicated pulse oximeter.

Often after the 15-second blood-oxygen test, this ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" notification would appear. Sliding the watch up the wrist tended to fix the issue.
An Apple spokesman provided this statement: ‚ÄúThe Blood Oxygen feature has been rigorously tested across a wide spectrum of users and across all skin tones. For a small percentage of users, various factors may make it difficult to get a blood oxygen measurement including motion, watch placement on the wrist, skin temperature and skin perfusion.‚Äù

But even if this all worked, there isn‚Äôt a clear enough reason for me to need this on my wrist all the time. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just pull out a pulse oximeter if I‚Äôm worried? While a low blood-oxygen level can be a gauge for the severity of Covid-19 and other conditions, there is no Apple Watch alert if yours drops below a certain threshold.

Apple says this is a wellness and fitness feature, not a health one, and it is beneficial to those who travel to places with higher altitudes or who are involved in performance training. Also, much like the heart-rate sensor, which is proving to be central to Covid-19 wearable studies, the blood-oxygen sensor can now be used to collect data to build detection algorithms and further medical research.

As for the always-on display, while I do appreciate being able to glance down and see the time without tapping on my wrist, I have had it disabled on my Series 5 for most of the year to eke out a bit more battery life. I‚Äôm even more interested in saving battery now that sleep tracking arrived with WatchOS 7.

No matter which model you pick, you have to recharge every day or so. If you sleep with your watch, you have to charge it when you wake up. Compare that to the $330 Fitbit Sense, which I charge every five days or so. It keeps tabs on your temperature, blood oxygen and heart rate. That said, it lacks a lot of the non-health functionality of the Apple Watch, and Fitbit‚Äôs software can be slow and buggy.

The ECG is really the only feature I would consider for the extra money. You have to follow your heart on that one (sorry, had to.) It‚Äôs a shame Apple pulled a vital health feature from the former Series 4 or 5 model it‚Äôs now calling SE.

The Future

Rewind the clock to 5¬Ω years ago to when the Apple Watch first shipped, and the technical leaps are massive‚Äîwaterproofing, bigger screens, better battery life, advanced sensors. Alongside those leaps, the product found its central purpose: fitness and health.

But it was mostly there with the Series 4. So why has development slowed to a snail‚Äôs pace since then? There could be two reasons: Apple engineers haven‚Äôt quite gotten the next major improvements right (multiday battery life in a thinner package), and Apple realized no one wants to buy a watch every two years like a smartphone. It makes you wonder why we need yearly updates on these at all?


The new Solo Loop bands don't have any clasps or buckles. You just slide your wrist into the stretch band.

Big leaps are still coming. I had a vision of it when I was hooked up to that monitor at my doctor‚Äôs office. The Series 6 already does two of the four readings: pulse and blood-oxygen levels. Temperature and blood pressure? Not yet. By combining more advanced health sensors and software that detects fluctuations, the Apple Watch and other wearables are going to become our ever-present health care minders.

In the here and now, though, the answer isn‚Äôt to buy a new one whenever a sensor gets added‚Äîespecially when it doesn‚Äôt necessarily work. If you have an older model, grab a pulse oximeter from your drugstore and the super comfy $49 Solo Loop band from an Apple Store and call it a day. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt Series 6 it."
242,"I‚Äôm actually kind of tired of the non-fitness people lamenting how useless the updates are. I trail run, hike, and road run, among other things, and the pulse oximeter and always-on altimeter is very nice to have, as well as the added battery life on outdoor runs. NONE of them seem to be mentioning these kinds of use-cases."

But even if this all worked, there isn‚Äôt a clear enough reason for me to need this on my wrist all the time. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just pull out a pulse oximeter if I‚Äôm worried? While a low blood-oxygen level can be a gauge for the severity of Covid-19 and other conditions, there is no Apple Watch alert if yours drops below a certain threshold.
Apple says this is a wellness and fitness feature, not a health one, and it is beneficial to those who travel to places with higher altitudes or who are involved in performance training. Also, much like the heart-rate sensor, which is proving to be central to Covid-19 wearable studies, the blood-oxygen sensor can now be used to collect data to build detection algorithms and further medical research.
As for the always-on display, while I do appreciate being able to glance down and see the time without tapping on my wrist, I have had it disabled on my Series 5 for most of the year to eke out a bit more battery life. I‚Äôm even more interested in saving battery now that sleep tracking arrived with WatchOS 7.
No matter which model you pick, you have to recharge every day or so. If you sleep with your watch, you have to charge it when you wake up. Compare that to the $330 Fitbit Sense, which I charge every five days or so. It keeps tabs on your temperature, blood oxygen and heart rate. That said, it lacks a lot of the non-health functionality of the Apple Watch, and Fitbit‚Äôs software can be slow and buggy.
The ECG is really the only feature I would consider for the extra money. You have to follow your heart on that one (sorry, had to.) It‚Äôs a shame Apple pulled a vital health feature from the former Series 4 or 5 model it‚Äôs now calling SE.
The Future
Rewind the clock to 5¬Ω years ago to when the Apple Watch first shipped, and the technical leaps are massive‚Äîwaterproofing, bigger screens, better battery life, advanced sensors. Alongside those leaps, the product found its central purpose: fitness and health.
But it was mostly there with the Series 4. So why has development slowed to a snail‚Äôs pace since then? There could be two reasons: Apple engineers haven‚Äôt quite gotten the next major improvements right (multiday battery life in a thinner package), and Apple realized no one wants to buy a watch every two years like a smartphone. It makes you wonder why we need yearly updates on these at all?
Big leaps are still coming. I had a vision of it when I was hooked up to that monitor at my doctor‚Äôs office. The Series 6 already does two of the four readings: pulse and blood-oxygen levels. Temperature and blood pressure? Not yet. By combining more advanced health sensors and software that detects fluctuations, the Apple Watch and other wearables are going to become our ever-present health care minders.
In the here and now, though, the answer isn‚Äôt to buy a new one whenever a sensor gets added‚Äîespecially when it doesn‚Äôt necessarily work. If you have an older model, grab a pulse oximeter from your drugstore and the super comfy $49 Solo Loop band from an Apple Store and call it a day. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt Series 6 it.

Uncertain Times Call 
 for Trusted Facts"
244,TIL: WSJ reporters have no idea what upsell means.
245,"Personally, the blood oxygen sensor doesn't seem that useful.

Personally I'd like to find an Apple Watch 5 with an attendant price drop, but they seem particularly hard to find right now (or the ones I do find have like a $20 price drop)"
246,"I've been playing with my Apple Watch 6 and close to reaching the conclusion that its not for me. (1) I dislike having to charge it each day, which is especially annoying for frequent travelers. (2) I bought it for swimming, but, again, one has to worry about turning on water mode, though there is a lot written that this feature is useless. (3) Finally, I dislike that I have to switch on Theater mode and/or Do Not Disturb mode to make sure it doesn't interrupt my sleep. I did like seeing my steps counted, but I can track that on my phone. Has anyone else reached these conclusions...before I return it? Much appreciated!"
247,I upgraded from S1 to S6 and found Blood O2 to be unreliable during hikes. I loved the idea of having an always on altimeter which is more accurate. I downgraded the S6 to an SE.
248,Thank you for doing this!
249,Why would they... it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a financial newspaper
250,"Currently, Walmart and Costco has a price drop on the iWatch S5. Other stores may follow later."
251,"Unless you‚Äôre over 50yo or have heart problems, there‚Äôs no reason to get the S6, except for AOD, which sucks because I really want it but I‚Äôm not paying $120 extra for it"
252,"I have a Garmin 735XT and you post is making me rethink the SE purchase. I used to swim often and I will be getting back into it. Ultimately, My garmin's battery is dying way too fast after 3 years of use and my girl just got the SE. It seems like the watch just works better and uses the data with more of a purpose. The Garmin brings data into the phone but then things easily fall out of sync. I am on the fence for sure.."
253,I want the Apple 5 because it has AOD. I don't need the blood oxygen sensor.
254,"I finally warmed up to my AppleWatch (6, if it matters) for tracking my swimming routine stats. And, the benefits seems worth learning the awkward set-up and charging."
255,How much did it cost?
256,I actually ended up getting a Fenix 6. It does not have WiFi so I can wear it at work. My IT department doesn‚Äôt allow WiFi devices.
257,I said I want one. I do not have one.
258,"Oh yeah sorry I read it ‚Äúwent‚Äù, me too, but I can‚Äôt find one in a justified price"
259,Same. I‚Äôm looking for a discounted one as well.
260,Good luck
261,"IMO, Apple Watch is always the recommendation in general just like the iPad, especially when it‚Äôs health related. But, if you‚Äôre looking for a budget Apple Watch, you can buy one of Apple‚Äôs previous generation models for $200. I gotta say that Apple last much longer than other watch brands out there because of the software support even if it means the price, you get what you pay for. I‚Äôm still using Series 3 GPS and it still runs like brand new."
262,"I can relate to all this. I end up taking my phone with on all hikes and jogs and even wear a fanny pack. I‚Äôll always take the watch off for water related activities due to potential for it to break when hitting a rock. (I already broke one) I don‚Äôt even store it in a water proof thing, I just leave it at home. 

I do end up  using it regularly for a few  things: tracking the time involved in various hikes and jogs and casually monitoring steps I take in a day, but more importantly paying attention to length of time involved in raised heart rate when engaged in cardio. I can take 10,000 steps a day, but if I never raised my heart rate, I haven‚Äôt accomplished much. 

 I also have many reminders set up for daily/weekly/monthly/annual recurring events/work related tasks with the Due App, which I absolutely love, but loved even more before Apple restricted the number of times a user could be reminded. 

I did not need the cellular version of the watch for these items, and I actually didn‚Äôt even need the watch for any of these things, these are all things I can do with my phone. 

In hindsight I would have simply  preferred the ability for a robust reminder app, heart rate monitor, and  time tracking on something that can handle a beating like a gshock. I don‚Äôt need much else."
263,">	I also have many reminders set up for daily/weekly/monthly/annual recurring events/work related tasks with the Due App, which I absolutely love, but loved even more before Apple restricted the number of times a user could be reminded.

I also really love the Due app; use it constantly. But, could you explain ‚Äî what is the part about Apple restricting the number of times you can be reminded? On the watch, Apple has limited how often an app can remind you?"
264,"iOS10 changed/limited this ability. It can no longer endlessly remind and stops at 10 times. The endless reminders was really what I needed the most, especially when you work in an environment with a lot of interruption that requires immediate attention. 

The iOS10 limitation was introduced for all apps other than the stock reminder"
265,"I upgrade every 3 cycles, started with the Series 0, then went to get the Series 4, and now Getting the Series 7, I'll wait for the Series 10 after this one. Unless Series 8 has huge changes from the 7."
266,I‚Äôm upgrading from a S1 so I‚Äôm prepared to be blown away haha
267,I noticed some of the reviewers don‚Äôt actually know what they are talking about. They are parroting off the leakers who are so salty they didn‚Äôt get it right. It‚Äôs actually annoying because they are biased reviews rather than objective evaluation of the watch. Not to mention nearly all of them don‚Äôt take in consideration some people do not own an Apple Watch and other people have a very old version of it. The whole point of buying apple products is the fact you don‚Äôt have to upgrade every bloody year.
268,Are there any hands on videos with stainless steel? Seems like they're all aluminum so far.
269,Upgrading my old reliable series 3 - I expect to be thrilled with the screen size!
270,"I ordered 41mm Starlight but after reviews I canceled and orderd stainless steel gold 41mm. On photos Starlight seemed more goldish and warm but every review I've seen it was very bright beige, almost silver in my eyes. Don't get me wrong, it's a very pretty color but I really like gold jewelry and want something that will match my style so I decided to splurge even more. It's gonna be my first Apple Watch ever and I hope it will last me years. The worst part of this is that my delivery date is pushed even further because I made new order - I will have to wait till December üòê"
271,"Based on the videos, the midnight looks pretty black at first glance. You see the blue if you look at it carefully/in the right light. Might look different in person."
272,Seems like there are no stainless steel reviews
273,"So far the reviews are mixed, doesn‚Äôt seem worth it if you own a 5 or 6. From the pictures the screen size difference is hardly noticeable. Might cancel mine (currently have a series 5)"
274,"This just in‚Ä¶reviewers confirm what we have already known since the Apple Keynote: the Series 7 is just a Series 6 with a slightly larger screen and two new watch faces.

Whether that is worth the purchase price is entirely up to you, but I‚Äôd imagine that most Series 5 and 6 owners can sit tight for the time being until Apple adds something more meaningful to the watch."
275,Still upgrading my beat up series 4 to the graphite stainless steel. I just plan on keeping this watch for a very long time.
276,[deleted]
277,I am on S3. Should I upgrade? I want to get the flat redesign they are talking about that might come next year. But this is tempting.
278,Midnight looks almost completely black in every video ive seen
279,"For the first time in all apple product reviews I‚Äôve watched, from multiple reviewers, they all seem to not be as impressed or excited about the 7 at all!  Omg. Even iJustine seemed kinda ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about it and talked mostly about Apple Fitness."
280,Any reviews on the 41 mm yet? I‚Äôm sizing down this year and want to make sure it‚Äôs not a mistake.
281,"Welp, that answers are questions.

Midnight is blue af.

Starlight is beige af."
282,Upgrading from S4 aluminum to S7 SS Graphite.  Probably most excited for the new case and always on display.
283,Still deciding between SS or Ti as this will be my first Apple Watch.
284,O M G
285,No white ceramic case?
286,"This will be my first Apple watch. I guess aside of color options (if you wanted pure black/white), I'm still happy with my choice to get the newest one. The 6 series is still $399+ at Best Buy, plus I got a $100 discount for the cellular version from my phone provider"
287,"I guess there‚Äôs no Titan reviews right now?

Mine is coming in a month üòü"
288,"Wondering if it makes sense to wait for the 8 since this is just a step up from the 6. More of an ""s"" upgrade it feels and I didn't see any reason to upgrade to that.
 
But i'm coming from a 3 so it'll feel huge to me regardless."
289,Just watched Brian Tong‚Äôs review. Looks great üëç
290,"Where the link at doe.


Also I‚Äôm happy with my S4, but if there‚Äôs amazing reviews I might make the leap."
291,"This is the 2nd apple device that I may upgrade too only because I regret my previous purchase.
I got the iPhone 13 pro only because I regret getting the iPhone 12 with no telephoto lens, and I might get the series 7 only because I regret getting the SE with no always on display. Neither seem like enticing options if I made the correct choice with the 12 pro/series 6 last year."
292,Why does every video seem the same (sponsored by Apple? Aka big tech)
293,I‚Äôm okay. Waiting for the flat boxy redesign
294,That moment when it is still not yet available in your country‚Ä¶have to wait by November. Watching reviews ok YT I guess will suffice.
295,"I love the ones that are saying ""this isn't a big upgrade!""  I'm not getting it!!  Blah blah blah.

It's an upgrade for the SAME EXACT PRICE AS THE 6!  I preodered mine, coming from the 2 it will be very nice."
296,"When there will be a bigger watch, this one is like a toy, I bought it and I'm not happy it's very small"
297,[deleted]
298,"I‚Äôm on the same cycle, 0 to 4 to 7. And even then, my series 4 is still chugging along just fine, but I figured I‚Äôd grab the Series 7 now as opposed to waiting another year."
299,I‚Äôm still on my Series 0. I guess I can do a 7 year cycle
300,"This is what I'm planning to do. I had the Series 1, 3, 4, and 5. I planned to keep the 4 for three years, but really loved the AOD of the 5. The larger screen of the 7 looks nice, but I'm sticking with my 5 until the Series 8, then ideally the Series 11.

Hopefully the silver comes back next year. I've grown to really like the starlight on my Mini 6, but given my collection of bands, it'll bug me not to have a neutral case color."
301,I‚Äôm still on series 3. Was about to get 7 but something tells me to wait for 8 as 7 has almost the same internals.
302,"I jumped from nothing to the 4 LTE for EKG, never used it but now I‚Äôm an Apple Watch person."
303,"Hello me, meet the real me. 
I‚Äôve just been waiting for a big enough difference for the 4. This seemed like it lol"
304,I just bought a 6 months new Titan watch 6 for a fair amount. I think that's the way to go. There hasn't been that much changes from 6 to 7.
305,"This will be my first Apple Watch,  so I am ready to be blown away as well."
306,[deleted]
307,"lol damn. I was blown away going from S3 to S4, can only imagine what it will be like for you."
308,"Here I am going from nothing to Series 7.


*Drinks Apple juice violently*"
309,I‚Äôm planning on upgrading from my s1 too. Currently debating if I want the 7 or would rather get a discounted 6.
310,I'm coming from an S2. Ready to be blown away as well haha
311,I had a S1 from launch through to October last year until it fell off my wrist and the screen shattered/popped off.  Been watch-less since then and am excited to get my S7.
312,I‚Äôm going from the 4 to 7. Not that big of a change from the S1 but super stoked about it coming in!
313,I‚Äôm upgrading from a series 0. It‚Äôs so worn the screen has started to delaminate from the top
314,I‚Äôm upgrading from a Casio Classic so yeah. No idea what to expect
315,Woah!
316,"Same here! I can't wait.  


I rode out my S1 down to the point where the battery bulged and popped the screen off."
317,Same. But I love my s1 its still amazing
318,Same! I was waiting for a sign and a couple of months ago my battery popped the screen of my S1 out. So I‚Äôve been holding out for the 7.
319,"I finally ordered this morning (unrelated to reviews)‚Ä¶ coming from an S0! 

At least, in 5-6wk that is üò§"
320,Im still on S1 as well. Deciding whether to get the 6 or the 7‚Ä¶
321,I am going from a series 0 or 1 watch (it is called Apple Watch 2015 so not sure what that is) whose cover glass just popped off recently. I hope I can keep the 7 for as long as I did that Watch.
322,you ought to substantiate your claim with a link to the parts you are referring to
323,"Well you have to give them credit, it‚Äôs not easy making a 10 minute video reviewing a ‚Äúnew‚Äù device that has a lightly bigger screen and slightly faster charging than the last years model‚Ä¶

All the reviews might as well say the following ‚Äúgo watch my review of the S6 and immagine it has a slightly bigger screen and it charges a bit faster. The end.‚Äù"
324,I‚Äôm waiting for Desfit and DC rainmaker for their review. Those reviewers is focused on smart watch and fitnesses tracking.
325,"It is annoying, isn‚Äôt it! Can you imagine car reviewers blasting companies for refinements made year over year to a car in the same model platform/generation. 

No one is expected to be buying these watches every single year. And if you are, then you should expect to be underwhelmed most years. But these are significant upgrades for the people that will likely be buying this."
326,"Most of this 'influencers' on YouTube in general (and I am mostly referring to the iPhone 13 early birds youtubers of late) are talking nonsense, and usually rave super positive reviews quoting the specs and the marketing fluff of apple. I believe its due to the fact they want to still be on the early bird list and get access to free products for years to come."
327,"https://youtu.be/HStRHwwb8Vo

Good review video imo. Dave does say it's a good buy for people with older Apple Watches or first time buyers."
328,Yeah I want to view the stainless steel as well but I‚Äôm guessing it won‚Äôt defer to those in series 6
329,Fml that‚Äôs gonna be a huge one !
330,">almost silver in my eyes

Yeah Starlight is replacing Silver.  


[This website](https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/16/apple-watch-series-7-colors-bands-release-date/) has direct comparisons between the different colours, which shows that Starlight is almost identical to silver, with a slight champagne tint."
331,"Yeah it's definitely beige, I actually prefer that over gold."
332,Yeah I actually really like the color. Doesn‚Äôt look nearly as blue as everyone is making it out to be
333,Wait - there isn‚Äôt a proper black version? I really hope I‚Äôm misunderstanding‚Ä¶
334,"I picked up a Midnight 13 iPhone mini and it's probably one of my favourite colours Apple has put out.  If the watch is the same way when it comes to light hitting it, it's going to look gorgeous in person."
335,"For me the screen upgrade from 3 to 4 was the biggest upgrade thus far on Apple Watch other than perhaps going from the S0 to S2/3 processor. Hard to believe this screen size upgrade isn't good too.

Edit: I watched a review video and the screen change is absolutely huge in my opinion. Coming from a 4 it is very tempting. I didn't think there was anything in 5/6 that was compelling enough to cause me to upgrade but this might."
336,I have a 5 as well. Zero reason to upgrade before new health sensors or better battery imo.
337,"Not sure why people are downplaying the screen upgrade so much. It looks as much or more of a screen upgrade than S3 to S4.

I have an S5 and day 1 pre-ordered the S7, can't wait."
338,So lie going the 8 to the 8s. I don‚Äôt care. I have the money. I get good re sale value. I buy
339,"If you found value in the S models for iPhones, this will be your cake. Nothing wrong with that. I‚Äôm going from no Apple Watch, to the 7 SS model so this is a big deal for me lol"
340,"The screen size difference probably isn‚Äôt the type of thing that will blow you away from pictures.

It‚Äôs more about things like the functionality of having 50% more text appear on screen (so that you can read longer messages one handed without scrolling). Or having the UI reworked with a new keyboard and easier to press buttons for apps."
341,I didn‚Äôt see a reason to come from a 4. I‚Äôll just wait until the 8. It feels like that‚Äôs going to be more of an upgrade from the 7 than the 7 was from the 6.
342,"This Korean guy is the only one I could find so far:
https://youtu.be/k3mLnzWrN7Y"
343,That‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm sure they all have 6 different versions to wear.
344,[Display on the 41mm is almost as big as the one on previous 44mm](https://i.imgur.com/7YHabW7.jpg). It's nice.
345,https://youtu.be/nE8qkQ6uHy0 Here you go!
346,"Yeah, I was really hoping starlight would end up looking more silvery in natural light but it somehow looks more gold. I have yet to see a decent shot of the midnight though‚Äîany links you can share?"
347,Clear money grab from apple to get people to upgrade to stainless or titanium.
348,Also green looks black/grey from most angles.
349,Go aluminum imo
350,Ti is lighter which is good if you prefer that (some don‚Äôt) and may make it ever so slightly better if you will regularly use it as a sleep tracker. Otherwise they each (ss vs ti) have unique looks so get the one you prefer.
351,I think there‚Äôs no ceramic this year.
352,here I am regretting not getting SS on my 5.
353,Really don‚Äôt get why people have been buying the SE. AOD is such a huge difference.
354,https://youtu.be/BsosQkfa2L8
355,"Same cycle here too. Nothing wrong with the 4 by itself, but the battery on mine has gotten pretty terrible which has been the primary motivator. It‚Äôs 3 years old; to me, might as well upgrade rather than spend money on it replacing the battery. I also kind of figure that with the 7 technically being a complete case redesign (even though it largely looks the same) we aren‚Äôt going to see some wild redesign next year; Apple will probably want to use the new design for at least 2-3 years. Doesn‚Äôt really give me reason to wait another year."
356,What are the major updates from the 4 to the 7?
357,Enjoy!
358,"Same here. My worry is that I‚Äôm going to hate having something on my wrist all the time, definitely gonna be an adjustment period."
359,Same here.
360,Same!!
361,"I also went from a 2 to a 6.  It's not like the experience is much different, it's more like the watch actually WORKS now instead of being a constant source of frustration.  Annoying that I had to drop money on a new watch due to planned obsolescence but...it is nice."
362,I went from 3 to 5! Same!
363,"I went from S0 to S4 and was like ‚Äúwait, I don‚Äôt have to call Siri 20 seconds in advance for her to start a timer?‚Äù

I feel like similar to the iPhone X where every phone going forward just feels like a definitive powerhouse (my X never slowed down in the 3 years I had it, ironically faster than when I got it following iOS 12), the S4 is the watch equivalent"
364,"Same here. I wanted to go from S3 to S7 but the screen crapped out so I just bought a 4.

I‚Äôm getting an S7 so my mom can have the old one, jumping 3 gens should still be significant."
365,I‚Äôd do the 7 personally
366,[deleted]
367,Welcome to the future Old Man!
368,You can always try retail stores as well and cancel your order if you find one! I got lucky with my iPhone 13 Pro and found one at my local T-Mobile.
369,He was telling people you can dive and shower with it as a reviewer I feel you should know what the specs actually mean. Most of them have had the watch for a week they could have observed how the faster charging may make it more practical and in what way. It may not be a new product to them who already have a watch but it is new to people who don‚Äôt have it and upgrading from older models. Anyway it was the overall vibe of the video he was committed not to like it.
370,"Should be easy to fill up 10 minutes if the reviewer is actually ya know... reviewing the device. If the comparison to the S6 is the subject of the entire video then that reviewer is simply bad at their job. Catering to annual upgraders is ignoring the vast majority of their audience. The average shopper is either buying an Apple Watch for the first time or upgrading from a much older version. At most, the S6 comparison should be a one minute section of the review and the rest of the time should be spent showing off *all* the features of the S7, regardless if the same features have been available on the previous generation."
371,"After a week you would think they would be able to tell you what differences in usage the improvement have made. I think it‚Äôs fine to compare it to the six but really and truly u shouldn‚Äôt have to upgrade a product every year anyway. I‚Äôm sure most of the people with the iPhone 12 Pro aren‚Äôt buying the iPhone 13 pro this year. Another reviewer pointed out earlier this week from Apple Watch 4-5 there were even less upgrades compared to what the 7 is getting. He also said the Apple Watch is now a mature product and we are not gonna see huge changes every year like we used to I agree with him, especially when the more complex health sensors are a few years out."
372,"YouTubers have to follow the guidelines sent by the product manufacturer, that basically is delivered to the intermediary that works with YouTubers."
373,I haven‚Äôt watched his video yet thank you
374,They are the same colors but I want to see what the reflections are like with the thicker sapphire crystal. Guess we just have to wait until Friday.
375,"I actually checked color on website you linked and I think my eyes are broken, it looked very gold to me! üòÇ Way warmer and goldish, especially when I looked at this one https://reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/q2vzxh/is_this_the_starlight_color_it_looks_gold_here/ 

And while watching reviews I've realized it's more silver than I thought üòÖ I would agree with calling it champagne color. 

It's very nice but I kinda wish they would keep aluminum gold too... Nevertheless I already ordered what will match me more but I really think Starlight will be good option for people who like neutral, delicate colors."
376,"Yeah, it's very nice color, just not for me but can see it working for many people! People complained that there is no neutral aluminum version but I think Starlight is pretty neutral."
377,"I disagree, as soon as i saw it in the video i thought, boy that's blue and when they put the space grey next to it, it shows even more how much bluer it is. Black bands will on accentuate that. Glad I got Starlight."
378,It will buy very blue if you go outside in sunny day
379,Not on the aluminum versions.  Midnight is the closest to black but so far the images suggest it is more of a very dark blue vs the black/space gray of before.  You need to go up to the stainless steel or titanium to get space black or graphite.
380,Not in aluminum
381,That is correct
382,Series 5 here. It‚Äôs pretty tempting but I‚Äôm going to wait til I can see it in person to really make a decision but I might get one once stock gets better
383,The screen size from 4 to 5 is the same right? I could understand upgrading from a 4 because by then the battery is degrading and the watch is probably a little slow due to bulky WatchOS upgrades
384,I‚Äôd agree but my ss5 battery has had it. I‚Äôm still thinking of a reduced price 6!
385,"The s3 to s4 was a 35% size increase in screen and a whole design change to rounded edges. The s6 to s7 is 20% increase in screen size with the same rounded edges. It‚Äôs nice, but It isn‚Äôt as big of a difference in any way"
386,Exactly they can‚Äôt be excited about a new product there‚Äôs no novelty in it for them anymore
387,That was fast! Thanks!
388,"Nothing yet. Everything i've watch, and it's been a lot, clearly shows Midnight is blue and Starlight is beige, the light at the end of the tunnel is unfortunately not there."
389,"100%

If you're gonna fuck over your customers who only want a neutral color and force them to upgrade to the stainless at least offer the stainless in a Nike version because that's the only version I get for the extra faces.

Def not gonna buy a more expensive case just too lose 6 watch faces."
390,It‚Äôs also a clear money grab the people that want to get the aluminum colors
391,It absolutely looks green from any angle.

393,Didn‚Äôt think I cared about it. Guess I was wrong. Also got GPS only and highly considering LTE but it‚Äôs so expensive.
394,Thanks
395,The 7 still looks the same though? I'm on the same cycle but see no reason to upgrade from 4 yet. Totally expect next years model to take the iphone route (hard edges) so I'll probably wait for that. Totally get upgrading because of the battery though!
396,How much does it cost to change the battery in an Apple Watch?
397,What are the major updates from the 4 to the 7?
398,"> Nothing wrong with the 4 by itself, but the battery on mine has gotten pretty terrible which has been the primary motivator.

I'm in the same boat. I'm not sure I'd call the battery terrible on mine but it's bad enough that I've started to notice.

So it sounds like people aren't saying *not* to upgrade to the 7, which is nice."
399,are people avoiding the 5/6 because it is a ‚Äòslightly better 4‚Äô (aka not a worthy upgrade) or there is something wrong with those models?
400,"I also have a 4. The battery is at 81% which is making me think about upgrading to the 7.  While I love my 4 in the black steel, I may stick to aluminum this time."
401,You can compare them on Apple‚Äôs website to get a clearer picture.
402,I‚Äôve had a Fitbit for a long time. You adjust to it.
403,3 ‚Äî> 4 ‚Äî> 5 ‚Äî> were all significant jumps in some way. 6 and 7 were iterative. I‚Äôm happy with my 5 and only upgrading to the 7 because my wife wants to. I‚Äôll enjoy The upgrade but don‚Äôt expect to be blown away.
404,"I loved my X, sometimes I still miss using it even though the 12 is faster. 

I‚Äôll probably feel the same way when I upgrade from the S4."
405,My screen fell out twice - fixed it twice - i beat this thing up and it shows - no case here either
406,"It seems to me like you watched one bad review and now you are generalizing. I watched two reviews (mkbhd and dave2d) and both of them mentioned how the improved fast charging impacted on the usability of the device. They both also mention in their reviews that the S7 is an extremely slight upgrade coming from a S4, S5 and S6 but for anyone with an older watch (or no watch at all) it‚Äôs a great purchase."
407,"Showering isn't new though. This Apple support article is out of date but still states: 

>Showering with Apple Watch Series 2 and newer is ok, but we recommend not exposing Apple Watch to soaps, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, and perfumes as they can negatively affect water seals and acoustic membranes. Apple Watch should be cleaned with fresh water and dried with a lint free-cloth if it comes in contact with anything other than fresh water.

408,"I moved from iPhone 7 to iPhone 13. Skipped 6 years of upgrades. At least when it comes to the camera, I am utterly disappointed. Its ok, but its not what I expected, and the photos are very comparable to the iPhone 7, and in some cases the iPhone 7 photos are way more optical and natural without all the AI woohaa that ruins a lot of them.  But the reviews makes you think you are getting a DSLR/mirrorless inside a phone....

I have the Apple Watch 6 and I have no plans upgrading anytime soon, but I would like to buy one as a gift to a family member, and I am debating with myself which model (6/SE/7).... and these reviews don't help at all, I really consider them fake reviews from people who want to be on Apple's influencer list."
409,I got the ss graphite 45mm and it‚Äôs scheduled to arrive on 15th October. Once I have it I may post it in here
410,"Yeah I wish they kept Space Gray, that would've been my go to."
411,Yeah I definitely find it pretty neutral
412,Hmm agree to disagree haha I feel the opposite about your band comment. I think the midnight/midnight band makes the watch overall more blue but the watch itself is pretty dark..
413,I disagree with you
414,"What a ridiculous decision. 

I go SS because of that scratch resistance, but the majority get aluminium, and I imagine most will want a proper black watch."
415,That‚Äôs where I am at. My four is just fine so I am in zero rush.
416,Yep. The four is still lightning fast and is as fast as a 5/6 for everyday tasks. Perhaps some third party apps  take advantage of whatever processing differences there are but built in stuff doesn‚Äôt seem to.
417,"I don't agree. 20% vs 35% isn't a big difference, but 0 to 20% is.

Especially when you combine it with the larger case size + smaller bezels, it'll make the difference seem larger than it actually is, IMO."
418,"I never even knew the SS watches got different glass!  I've never managed to scratch the glass on my aluminum ones though and it looks like the series 7 aluminum this year gets some new ION-X crystal glass, but the SS do get sapphire."
419,"I‚Äôm not really sure how I feel about the same design as iPhones. I feel like it‚Äôll be too uncomfortable to wear especially when working out with how the back of the wrist can be touching the side of the Watch. 

As someone with an S4, I‚Äôm very tempted to upgrade for the features that have been implemented since."
420,"It looks the same, it is physically different though; it is slightly taller for one. I would assume Apple would want some economies of scale out of this before making another physical change as such. But I could be wrong."
421,"They are snappier tho, I‚Äôve noticed it with the series 6. Day to day it doesn‚Äôt bother me, but if I mess around with a 6 for a bit, I notice the slightly slower performance. The difference is small, but on a device like this, the slightest annoyance or lag can make you not use it and go to your phone. That was the best part of going from a Series 0 to the 4, the screen was definitely nicer, but it was the snappiness that made it more pleasant to use.

Edit: to clarify I have a 4 currently"
422,I‚Äôm thinking the same.
423,"> Totally expect next years model to take the iphone route (hard edges) 

Why would people want hard edges on a watch though? Unless they figure out how to make it much thinner, I guess. Otherwise, give me the contours."
424,"Apple‚Äôs site says $79. I mean all things said it‚Äôs not really a lot, I just don‚Äôt like spending that kind of money on something I can probably only sell for at most twice that. Personal preference really."
425,"The always-on screen from the 5, blood oxygen  sensor from the 6 are the big ones off the top of my head. More storage I think started with the 5 (32GB vs 16 in the 4). And then the 6 -> 7 features with the new display and whatnot. Probably a small handful of other things I missed."
426,"I‚Äôm sure it depends on usage too. Mine is around 75% health and occasionally it dies by mid afternoon, although recently it‚Äôs been a tad better, but it almost never makes the whole day anymore. Sounds like the 7 probably isn‚Äôt worthwhile if you have a 6 and maybe even a 5, but I feel like it could probably go either way with the 4. Since my battery isn‚Äôt so hot anymore it makes it more worth it for me."
427,"More like the former I guess. It's not that the features they added weren't good (they are), but I know for me personally the watch doesn't change enough year to year to upgrade every year. I don't think Apple expects anyone but the absolute diehards to do that either probably. I feel like the 5/6 were more for new buyers or people coming from 2/3 than they were yearly upgraders."
428,"I went from a 3 to a 6.   I likely won‚Äôt upgrade again for 3 more versions so,  keeping with the number scheme from the iPhone,  my next will be the Apple Watch X.  lol"
429,"Yeah I'm upgrading from my 5 to 7 for cellular primarily.  Don't expect to be blown away, but the extra screen should be nice.  Additionally, I'm going from aluminum to SS, to the quality difference should feel like a solid upgrade as well."
430,"The only real problem I had with my X was that ***right*** where the send button was, sometimes the screen would be unresponsive there. The fix was to simply lock and unlock your phone, and they had a warranty program for it which got me a ""new"" X, but it still had the problem. Still loved that phone.

The only reason I got a 12PM was because I needed more storage. Otherwise I would've most likely kept that phone until USB-C or it ran out of support (so, an eternity)."
431,"I said ‚Äúsome‚Äù not all so I‚Äôm not generalising, I realise what comes up on someone YouTube page when looking up reviews is a subjective experience. I watched at least two where the bitterness/disappointment of the leaks comes through into the review. The product is not meh, they literally re-engineered the display to me that‚Äôs a pretty big deal."
432,I wish we could see it with a black band.
433,"You judge the color of Midnight however you want, and the rest of us will judge it's color for what it actually is, navy blue."
434,"I‚Äôm one of those ‚Äúmost‚Äù and that‚Äôs I haven‚Äôt ordered one until I actually see them in person. If either green or midnight looks decent I‚Äôll probably get one, if not, I‚Äôll stick with my falling apart S3 for another year"
435,"I have a four decided to just get the battery replaced. Until there is a big battery boost or something big hardware wise, the 4 still does everything I need it to."
436,"I mean you don‚Äôt have agree. It literally isn‚Äôt as big of a difference by the numbers. What something seems and what it really is are two different things.

This is specifically referring to screen change of the the s3 to s4 change vs the s6 to s7. So comparing 0 to 20% doesn‚Äôt really apply

Like I said, still nice, but factually not as big of a difference in size"
437,Thanks so much. Makes sense.
438,good to know. as i am a new buyer and i just started with the 5
439,"I expect the 8 to have a new sensor and, if rumors pan out, the first watch to improve on the ‚Äúall day‚Äù battery life. If so, I might upgrade again and hold that for 2-3 versions."
440,"Before the X I had a 7+, even after I replaced the screen+battery that phone was flawless and plenty fast when I gave it away. I got the 12 because it was essentially only $70 to upgrade with T-Mobile‚Äôs promo, and I was going to pay that to replace the battery.

I‚Äôll probably get the 13PM because of the better battery and higher storage. Then that‚Äôll be my forever phone."
441,"You just sound butt hurt that they didn‚Äôt like the product as much as you did , what a fanboy lol."
442,"1. Link the videos you are referring to. I have no idea who you are talking about so I can‚Äôt continue this conversation. 

2. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as calling it ‚Äúre-engineering‚Äù when in reality they literally just pushed the bezels a mm further."
443,Seems to match black pretty well in the [top right](https://i.redd.it/xc3cprrt19t71.jpg) pic.
444,You are so incredibly mean!! You ruined everything!!!!!!!
445,Ahhhhhhhhghhhhhhhhhh
446,I hope you wait up all night for you midnight apple watch and then it gets delayed!! And then its actually way more blue then you ever thought!
447,"Can you take a few months to save the difference and go SS? 

Honestly I‚Äôve treated my SS S4 like shit, and it literally doesn‚Äôt have one scratch on the screen (I presume you get a better grade of glass too?) or body. If I cleaned it and put it next to a brand new one you wouldn‚Äôt know the difference.

Although the green does look bad ass."
448,"if you get the battery replaced, its basically a new watch and your resell is higher. Its basically worth about as much as a new SE now

so if you sold it you'd be able to buy a series 7 cheaper"
449,"> It literally isn‚Äôt as big of a difference by the numbers. What something seems and what it really is are two different things.

Except you can't look at it objectively like this. Size differences are all about perception. Reducing the bezels compared to just increasing the entire footprint, which is what happened with S3 -> S4, is going to make it *seem* like the difference is larger than it actually is. We're barely getting a larger case, but we're getting 20% more screen space, with greatly reduced bezels.

The jump from S3 to S4 was objectively larger, but the perception difference is going to be as big or bigger on the S7."
450,"I didn't order a Series 7, but cool story."
451,Stainless models have sapphire crystal instead of glass‚Äîsuper durable.
452,"I guess I could, but I just don‚Äôt think a different color is worth the price difference for me personally."
453,I have the stainless steel so could probably do a 1:1 swap for the base model if I wanted to.
454,"I can look at it objectively because that is separate than looking at it subjectively.

I‚Äôm not saying the difference won‚Äôt seem bigger from s6 to s7 when going s3 to s4, I agree with you there. I‚Äôm just saying it literally isn‚Äôt.

We‚Äôre on the same page"
455,Gosh you are so good at making people frustrated! Agghhh
456,"The main driver wouldn‚Äôt be the different colour, it would be scratch resistance. 

I smacked it off a door frame really hard. There was a mark. I was devastated. Turns out, the watch had taken paint and a tiny bit of wood off the door frame. A quick wipe and it was good as new!"
457,"I mean...ok, but that's just useless information, then."
458,"Not really. It just shows perceptions aren‚Äôt always factually correct. Can be a good thing in some cases like this, and bad thing in other cases."
459,"Apple Watch 6 44mm GPS+LTE Red edition

The watch as we know isn‚Äôt much of an upgrade from the 5.
The new features are basically the blood oxygen, the faster s6 chip, the new ultra wide U1 chip and the faster charging time of 1.5 hours and of course the 20% brighter always on display.

So here‚Äôs my take on the features it‚Äôs supposed to stand out from the watch 5.

1. I personally didn‚Äôt find the watch to be surprisingly faster than the watch 5 unless I was booting up or running tons of apps in the background.
2. The watch was the same brightness when on but was much much brighter when out in the sun and direct sunlight was hitting the displays. Indoors the always on display looks almost of the same brightness, except the colours on the 6 looks more crisper.
3. I compared the blood oxygen sensing to that of an hospital‚Äôs (I went for a test) as well as a local pulse oximetry device. The watch did accurate readings when hand was super stable and was worn higher up the wrist than usual. The blood oxygen levels measured during sleep were somewhat accurate too. The readings were almost same as the pulse oximetry device and almost came close to the hospital grade machine. 
4. Battery time took a hit since I had the LTE edition and I workout everyday for 6 hours so tracking that might have been a battery killer apart from the noise app which was also flagged to be dropping battery for others.
5. I can‚Äôt comment on the ultra wide U1 chip yet because I didn‚Äôt find much of a use for it. 

Overall I felt that the faster charging and brighter always on display were fantastic but at the same time I‚Äôm dejected that Apple didn‚Äôt make something ground breaking this year, I can understand that the people working at Apple had to manage COVID at the same time. 

If you‚Äôre planning on upgrading from a watch such as the 1,2,3 edition or maybe from nothing to an Apple Watch and want the fastest, brightest and health conscious watch and don‚Äôt care about the bucks you gotta spend this is the one for you. 
But if you are already having a 4 or 5 edition, spending the bucks on a watch with just 10% more features isn‚Äôt worth the value. Maybe wait for 7 or 8 to come with better features."
460,How do u get your watch to show this?
461,I think only visible during the initial pairing process...
462,It only comes during the time you‚Äôre pairing your watch to your iPhone
463,"Watches are usually boring. They tell the time with a static and monotonous face. Apple made one with a screen that looks high-class and has a designer touch, and hey, you get the thrill of customization too. 

Comparing it to other smart watches doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. Most Apple Watch users are regular watch owners. They don‚Äôt need a million cheap thrills to be entertained by their wearables. 

Also, this is an Apple Watch sub... guess you‚Äôre not exactly going for high post karma OP."
464,"TW: if you‚Äôre an Apple fanboy and you‚Äôre triggered by people having opinion on their Apple products, don‚Äôt read this comment.

I will not say it‚Äôs boring because... it‚Äôs a watch. 

I have one since November 2020 and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúheh. Ok. It‚Äôs fun but it could be better‚Äù.

Aesthetically, it‚Äôs a beautiful watch, very slick, high class, top quality, not bulky, very lightweight...

But technically... It bugs me a little a smartwatch 200‚Ç¨ cheaper than the Apple Watch can have better health, HR and sleep tracking, and can last 2-3 days without charging. 

Regarding ‚Äúthe thrill of customisation‚Äù, well. It‚Äôs very ‚ÄúApple-centred‚Äù. If you want cool or basic complications, you have to download and sometimes pay a ton of apps. 
I don‚Äôt remember downloading 10+ apps to have basic infos on my older watches.

Maybe the thrill of changing the colour of your watch bands every now and then...

Overall, I like the watch. I really do. Particularly the fact that it keeps you motivated with the challenges and the rings. I wish it was more open to customisation and the battery life was better."

547,"Hey I am curious on your opinion I am about to get the series 6, but worried it won‚Äôt give me enough help and fitness overview like the Fitbit sense and garmin venu"
548,"That's what I do since I sleep with it. I charge about an hour after work and about an hour before I leave in the morning, the batteries always between 40% and 90% charge. I'd consider that all day because if I forget to charge after work it'll make it through the night and I'll wake up the next morning at like 25% to 30% (which can make it the full day if I turn off radios and notification mirroring and just use it as a ""dumb"" watch)"
549,"But I wish Apple Watch did it, not looking for an alternative for Pillow."
550,I usually sleep with my watch and use AutoSleep but didn't realize it had an alarm feature. Ive been setting alarms on my phone. Do I just set up an alarm in AutoSleep and it'll use the haptic engine on the watch?
551,4 with an always on display
552,At this point it seems he intentionally inserts one wrong fact into his videos lol
553,Wow this must be new (or maybe I need to open Settings more). My launch day Series 3 is somehow still at 95%
554,I can't do this on my Series 0 lol
555,"Didn‚Äôt know this existed, and I think mine is wrong. S3, had it since launch- 100%."
556,"He really does. I can‚Äôt say I ever found his statements just plain wrong. He makes good videos that inform the general population in a very digestible way. Honestly, it‚Äôs like attacking Bill Nye‚Äôs show for not being academic enough when it‚Äôs a kid‚Äôs show..."
557,If you think things are better over in Android land...yeah.
558,MKBHD has always stated that he has two daily drivers at all times - an Android and an Apple device.

561,"Elitists wants to get their elitist opinions out there, look at me i know more than the common consumer"
562,"Me too, the keynotes are always exciting but I like seeing the bite-sized breakdowns people like MKBHD do, even though I'm rarely getting any new info from the video."
563,I upgraded from the s3 to s6 and the AOD is really helpful to me. Also it lasts me the whole day with plenty of battery to spare. Around 35 to 40 percent left by time I go to sleep
564,"Yeah, there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúSmart Alarm‚Äù in the watch app that does a combination of haptic taps and early wake up if you are in light sleep.

Only downside is that it has to be manually activated every night, due to OS constraints. Can‚Äôt set it on an auto schedule."
565,Bingo
566,*Eastereggs confirmed /s*
567,What? I actually take care of my watch and it‚Äôs at 84% ü§î it‚Äôs not even launch day
568,Excellent point! All these other channels doing in depth stuff and somehow he stays getting hate for staying in his own lane
569,Manufactured authenticity.
570,Yea let‚Äôs just roll with that BS excuse. Sure
571,Please no
572,He's done a studio tour with Lou
573,What happened to unbox therapy? I geniually don't know
574,"Yea I usually play his videos in the background, sort of like having your TV on for background. Somewhat calm vibes"
575,[deleted]
576,Pillow doesn‚Äôt require manual activation. But I also don‚Äôt use automatic sleep detection
577,I can't see anywhere in the app to set the smart alarm. There's a section in settings but it just opens a link that explains it.
578,I mean I would rather someone show me that for some weird shit I have to be perfect or it wont work
579,"Honestly I think it was that iPhone controversy a few years back. Also another case thing but I don‚Äôt know

IMO, I wouldn‚Äôt say Unbox Therapy ‚Äúredeemed‚Äù himself but I don‚Äôt find find videos that obnoxious anymore. He definitely tuned it down for the better. I don‚Äôt really watch his videos anymore but his LG Wing and Xbox controller video popped up on my feed and they weren‚Äôt bad surprisingly when I checked it out"
580,Nice
581,>	in the **watch** app
582,"Alright, I've been subbed to him but I haven't watched videos in years but I thought he was ""legit"" but I've seen a couple of comments lately referring him as not good"
583,All these tech YouTuber thumbnails turn me off. I end up watching some small channel that actually puts effort and doesn‚Äôt rely on thumbnails catered towards 3 year olds
584,Agreed smaller chains are where it's at! Unfortunately I read somewhere that these thumbnails are part of the YouTube algorithm for sorting videos
585,"I'm a bit let down with this review to be honest... I'll never buy the Apple watch since it's way out of my price range, but I was looking forward to an in depth review. And frankly this isn't the best review, it's more a video about his likes and dislikes of a new product. I'm missing the more technical aspects of the watch, what we can expect for the future, how the screen and button arrangement works in different environments, and so on. 

That aside, it was a good general presentation of what the watch is and can do."
586,Anybody else seeing a random black bar pop up every few seconds?
587,"Man, the peeps over at /r/AppleWatch are LIVID about this review.  It's kinda funny, really."
588,See dat tinder app?? You dog
589,"I also would never buy the Apple Watch, because it's Apple. The price ($349 for the base one) is close to what I think I will end up spending on a Android Wear watch (waiting for the reviews on the Huawei)

Seriously, I would like to have the Apple Watch capabilities for the price, on a watch that runs Android Wear so it's compatible with my Nexus 6:

* It has a full metal body (the Moto360 cracks on the back)
* Has a speaker, okay, speakerphone sometimes is useful, but being able to hear the notifications is important too
* It can do mobile payments
* Contrary to what he said, it's an OLED screen, and it has more DPI than any Android watch, which is strange, coming from Apple
* The heart rate sensor really works, most AnW watches have poor sensors with too small areas that get cought in hair. 

And even the price, for Apple, for the quality (I had one sport in hand), the features, and the fact that's 8GB, it's not even bad...

As for MKBHD, that's his review, I don't find it useful, but it's his opinion."
590,"Thought it was my tablet, thanks"
591,"Yup, not just me."
592,"Pure entertainment. One guy said he spent too much time on ""useless things like watch-faces"". I couldn't take any of them seriously after that."
593,"Last time everyone commented on his Tinder app it was actually Fenix, his Twitter client. "
594,"Awesome, thought my GPU was dying on me or something."
595,In their defense tho this was the worst review video I've seen him do. Now yea they are hyper critical of negative reviews but this wasn't even a complete video review. Disappointed. 
596,"Ditto, thought it was the driver being a pain again"
597,"The issue is, I understand it, this review made in the middle of his exam time, and I can see he likes the way that the Android Watches are designed. He also prefers Android more as a whole, so that gives him a certain bias."
598,I just blamed Flash. :(
599,"Yea that's fine. It's known he likes android. And that's perfectly okay, but in all of his other reviews he basically answers the question ""what do I need to know about this device?"" And comprehensively covers the features and uses of each device. He skips over massive portions of the features and uses of the Apple Watch. How can he not mention Apply Pay? How can he not mention Siri? How can he not mention the other types of bands available? Or the Contextual uses of the physical buttons? Or the fact that watch native apps are coming soon? He barely covers force touch, barely covers water resistance, the fitness apps, heart rate monitor and digital touch. Having an opinion on the watch is fine, but for a video review I thought it was sorely lacking content. He also deals with the price as if it is a static. He tries to state that the functions need to justify the 700 dollar price tag. What about if I paid 350? I have the same functionality at that price point. I don't know. Love his videos but this was simply a poor one. "
600,Problem is I am using HTML5 player
601,"> He skips over massive portions of the features and uses of the Apple Watch.

Exactly this. The one thing I've been wondering most about the watch is the heart rate monitor, and its quality. But MKBHD appears to have completely overlooked the health aspects of the watch altogether. He also didn't really discuss what he thinks of the pricing structure (i.e., sport vs. regular). It seems like, for the hype surrounding this product, the review should have been 15-20 minutes."
602,"Just a small hint for maps: A heartbeat rythm vibrations means go left (imo because heart is on the left side), a steady vibration means go right."
603,I use the reminders a lot! Love how I can just raise my wrist and say what I need to be reminded of! Timers too.
604,[deleted]
605,Which band did you go with?
606,"Yeah I don't know why people complain about the battery. I wear mine all day, I use heart rate a lot. I get a bunch of notifications. I text on it a lot. Mine usually goes down by 50% or less for my entire day. I have been wearing it for 3 hours and it only went down 1%"
607,I have alexa philip hue lights in my room controlled by alexa how can i control the lights on my watch?
608,Why on earth did you buy a series 5 if you don‚Äôt intend to use always on?
609,"Sorry for being so late lol, but I'm strongly considering getting the series 5 as my first smart watch too. I read in another comment that you got the sport loop, how is it still holding up? Also, if you exercise, do you wear it while doing so and how does it and the watch handle the sweat?"
610,"2 weeks with my S5 44m LTE and the need to charge every night is still there.

I turned off Always On feature last night after I fully-charged it before 12mn and now it‚Äôs 6:22 PM and it‚Äôs only 53% battery remaining."
611,Mine scratches so easily!!! It‚Äôs way worse than my 3. I already have two deep gashes since release day. My 3 never had anything like that. Good thing I have apple care
612,Oh wow I‚Äôm going to have to watch out for that. That‚Äôs really good to know
613,"WHAAAAAAAAAAT.

Never noticed this!!"
614,I owe you a drink.
615,">imo because heart is on the left side

Was aware of the difference but that's an interesting perspective, never thought of it like that!"
616,woah is this true? it's little things like this that make you realize how much thought goes into designing.
617,Thanks for that...it makes the left / right turn vibrations so easy to remember üëç
618,Right now just lights (hue) I plan to add ikea blinds and then a Yale lock in the future.
619,I went with the Pride Edition Sport Loop one.
620,"Upvoted to cancel out your downvote. I'm the same, and I go for a 10k run every other day too"
621,Yeah it easily lasts longer than I ever expected. Really happy about that. I can forget to charge and not be like oh it‚Äôs going to die.
622,"Same here. First time smart watch buyer, battery has been great (I charge at night). Normally finish around 16 hours with around half charge remaining.

Slack notifications all day, checking activity, workouts, flashlight, whatever."
623,You would have to add the Phillip Hue light to homekit. And then you can control it with the watch by using Siri or the Homekit App.
624,Because I thought I would but then didn't plus I didn't want to go to a store and get a 4 when I can just get a 5 online with a band of my choosing and get 3% back with my Apple Card. Plus now in the future if I want to use always on I can since I have the option.
625,Hey no worries. It is holding up great. It‚Äôs never came off while working out when I‚Äôve worked out. My wrists don‚Äôt normally get sweat so I don‚Äôt know how it would hold up. But it still looks like new to me.
626,Hmm I haven't scratched mine yet. I am being very careful where my arm goes and trying to make sure I don't knock it into anything. I don't have Apple Care on mine personally but I think I will be fine without it for the time being.
627,I‚Äòd like a pint of Guinness please :)
628,[deleted]
629,Nice! The sport loops are pretty good.
630,Aww fellow scholar I see we are on the same side indubitably
631,Dont have a bar code or code
632,Awesome! Thanks for the response!
633,I've had 3 different aluminium watches since launch and never scratched any. And I ain't that careful. I do office jobs though

[Apple Watch User Guide watchOS 6](https://books.apple.com/us/book/apple-watch-user-guide/id1475314179)"
636,Yeah I am impressed that the small velcro holds it really well on my arms especially when I flail them for no reason lol
637,Your hue hub is what you need to connect to the homekit app then it should auto get the lights that are linked to it via the hue app.
638,Biggest factor for me is the always on display so it behaves like a real watch. The SE doesn‚Äôt come with it. If you don‚Äôt care about that and the small missing niche features then it‚Äôs a great deal
639,"I ordered this and the SE phone because it was the lowest point of entry to get my grandfather that fall detection feature.

He's been fainting a lot in recent years, and this should help give him some peace of mind for when he's not around other people."
640,"I just picked up the SE as I can't justify the significant extra cost for O2 sensor that shows questionable results, an always-on screen (don't need to have the screen on when I'm not looking at my watch), and a U1 chip that currently has zero value.  The watch is a nice upgrade from my series 3.  Still won't replace my Garmin Fenix 5S for serious hikes (6+ hours) as activity tracking for that long crushes the battery."
641,"I‚Äôd rather upgrade from an S3 to an S5 instead of an SE tbch. Isn‚Äôt there the ECG on the 5? Bc if there is, I had a heart condition. Was ablated but still a possibility to come back. I‚Äôd rather fork up the extra $100-200 to kinda see if I don‚Äôt have it come back"
642,Anyone on the fence I can honestly say my Apple Watch is one of my favorite purchases in a while. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd use it as much as I do but just the little things like being able to find your phone or control music from your phone is something I really like. I also love the fitness features and use it to track my runs and listen to music since I don‚Äôt bring my phone. It sounds small but I can say I love having it.
643,Wait what why didn't I hear of this before
644,"This is tough for me. Wanted a Apple Watch for years, never had the money for one. Just got enough and I fell like this is my opportunity. Is it worth it?"
645,"For me an Apple Watch is a no-no because of the battery life of 18h and a slow charging. Most of the time you cannot bring it to sleep cause you forget to charge it, so you miss the sleep analysis. I would rather have a less fancy watch with 5-7 days battery life like a garmin or a fitbit smartwatch. I hope Apple manages to make the next watch with at least 3 days battery life, because the looks and the OS is way nicer, but until then I will have to wait."
646,"My birthday was in August and my GF promised me an Apple Watch. When they announced these it was a no brainer, we ordered a Watch SE immediately."
647,"Really seems like Apple is hitting it out of the park, while Google trips on it's dick repeatedly.  That 'made by google' or whatever announcement was a bit of a joke."
648,"I really do want an Apple Watch because of all the bells and whistles the OS offers, but the Versa lineup‚Äôs 6 day battery life and Alexa-button are just too good to pass up for me. Still really cool to see how far the Apple Watch has come!"
649,"I'm not sure if ever seen ""pay a lot less"" and "" apple"" in the same sentence"
650,Does it come with ecg ?
651,Read/watch the dcrainmaker review instead of theverge
652,Honestly if it‚Äôs your first time with an Apple Watch. The series 3 is $169 and basically the same outside of the display.
653,I have the S5 and I turned it off as soon as I got it. I couldn‚Äôt stand the always on
654,"Always on is neat, but you don‚Äôt miss seeing the watch face. You lift or turn or wrist either way. It‚Äôs not worth the extra $. With Apple, it‚Äôs always best to buy what you can afford and call it a day."
655,So basically less for less? I mean it makes sense but I hate it for some reason
656,pay a lot less my ass wtf
657,No ecg weeeell that‚Äôs exactly what I want so that‚Äôs a no for me
658,[deleted]
659,Getting an se today but man the Canadian price hurts compared to the us. $349 + tax!
660,SE worth it IMO. You flip your wrist to check the time anyway which turns on the screen. No need for AOD
661,Doesn‚Äôt come with the cool cord band as shown in these photos.
662,I just want an Apple watch with a round dial please.
663,"It is my opinion that from a user experience perspective, this watch offers nothing more than Apple Watch S1 except an improved software along with a processor adequate to run it smoothly."
664,What band is that?
665,"For someone who doesn‚Äôt have a watch at all, what would be a good choice? I own an iPhone 11 Pro if that matters at all."
666,"As someone who could not care less about the EKG or O2 sensor or any of that stuff, I‚Äôm thrilled to see this!"
667,I'm waiting for their announcement of AirTags. The usage of U1 chip can be interesting. If not I'll just go with a refurb S5.
668,Not bad for the price. I‚Äôll probably get my mom this for Christmas to go with her iPhone SE.
669,"I‚Äôm skeptical.  I was on Apple Watch from the jump but I have not upgraded yearly.  I purposely went Stainless because of the sapphire, but the aging experience with these devices has been miserable.

I kept the Series 0 for two years, then upgraded to a used Series 3 in great condition.  Both have been bad experiences after year one.  Glitchy OS, weird Siri failures, communication issues with phone, plus physical failings like glass coming apart and battery problems with the Series 0."
670,If only the battery would last for days that would be great.
671,The cellular version is only $50 more whereas on the S6 it‚Äôs still $100.
672,"If they would/could put this in a Fitbit size form, I‚Äôd be all over it. I love the idea of an Apple Watch but they look and feel awkward on my bony wrists. Lanky first world problems, I nbow"
673,"I‚Äôll still be over here waiting for the day when they make an Apple Watch that lasts longer than 1 day of me being awake üëèüèª. Someday, someday."
674,All these watches looking so mad lol
675,I had an Apple Watch 1 but never saw the use for it. It always distracting me but was kinda useful in the gym. The SE is tempting me just to use for fitness. Wouldn‚Äôt mind tracking my runs and heart rate as well as just using it for music so I don‚Äôt have to carry my phone.
676,Anyone know what that band is? And who makes it
677,Wouldn‚Äôt the better buy be the 5 series when it goes down in price till they stop making them ?
678,Where the hell can I find that wrist band at though!? Serious question.
679,I‚Äôve had the Nike SE for 3 days now...IMO it‚Äôs the best offer for the money
680,">	it‚Äôs the same thing as a Series 4 from 2018, with just two minor differences: the SE doesn‚Äôt have the ability to measure your ECG, but does have an always-on altimeter.

From what I‚Äôm seeing the series 4 & SE are roughly the same price but the 4 has ECG and the SE does not. 

I guess it‚Äôs personal preference if you want an altimeter or ECG but the 4 is the winner for me."
681,Can someone tell whats the name of the watch face in the article please?
682,"Just got my SE, my first Apple Watch, and I‚Äôm loving it so far. It‚Äôs fast, battery life is decent, I still haven‚Äôt even looked into the available apps and other features so I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more to find out."
683,"Are there people here who use this for running?
Is it able to connect with the Nike app?"
684,[deleted]
685,I have the 6 and would definitely say its not worth the extra. The blood oxygen reader doesn‚Äôt work well. The finger ones are so much better and only cost $20. Plus you really don‚Äôt need constant monitoring of blood oxygen unless you have certain medical conditions.
686,Does it have the ECG function?  Can‚Äôt find that info anywhere.
687,"I really can't decide. If I only knew for sure if I want/need the always on display the choice would be clear.

For the price the SE would be an awesome deal. Can anyone say if the always on display is really worth it? How's battery life affected? Is it annoying to not have always-on activated?"
688,"I‚Äôm still contemplating getting the SE over the Series 3. I‚Äôve been having issues with my Series 3 since I upgraded it to watchOS 7 (randomly locking on my wrist, randomly shutting off), and upgrading to watchOS 7 was a bit of a hassle (had to factory reset it). 

I thought it was a good deal until I realized it didn‚Äôt have the ECG feature on it. I don‚Äôt necessarily need it for my health needs (22M), but it would be nice to have.

I'm looking at getting a phone in the next month or so and will probably decide between those two.  I'm also considering getting either the new baseline iPad or the new iPad Air.  I'm glad apple hasn't shied away from some entry level products.
694,Is the battery different to compensate for the always on display?
695,"I just bought a like new S4 Stainless steel Gold 44mm for $325 from a dude on OfferUp. Honestly, i love it. It has built in LTE so i can just run with my watch and AirPods Pro and leave my phone in my car. I can stream podcasts and Spotify, take phone calls and messages without my phone on me.

719,"I‚Äôd prefer the watch not have always on. But that‚Äôs just me, the screen may be darker on the new ones now"
720,"Honestly , the se is not worth it. If I‚Äôm paying close to 300 dollars , I might as well pay 50 more for a series 5 or 100 more for a series 6 and get the aod, plus all the other features. Aod is a way bigger deal than some people make it out to be."
721,"I have a hard time understanding why an always-on display is appealing if you have to raise your arm to read the display anyway.. ?????? It‚Äôs a gimmick, no?"
722,Crazy how people like different things. First thing I did with my AW5 was turn off always on. Was so used to it not being on with my series 0 that I don‚Äôt need it on and raise to wake works just fine.
723,I don‚Äôt actually notice it all that much on AW6 to be honest
724,But wouldn‚Äôt that feature drain your battery much fast?
725,"Eh, I used the always on when I first got my 5, but given that it turns on whenever I look at it, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs on when I don‚Äôt look at it, I disabled it in favor of longer time between charges. 

After trying it, I really don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a big deal to some. The fraction of a second between looking at my wrist and when the screen pops up?"
726,A real watch doesn‚Äôt need to be recharged daily anyway...
727,That and the faster processor is why I went with the 6. More future proof and a better feature to begin with. I also wanted the brighter screen. I don‚Äôt care about the oxygen feature at all.
728,And its not that much cheaper. $309 vs $399.
729,Most people I know with an Apple Watch turned the always on display off after a couple days. It‚Äôs a huge drain on battery life for not much gained in efficiency or performance
730,I don‚Äôt know of anyone with an S5 that left that feature on.
731,I wish reviews on tech products were as simple as your 3 sentence  comment.
732,"This. Reason why I haven‚Äôt bought or even thought about any Apple Watch before 5 was always on display. A watch that displays nothing until you twist the wrist is the dumbest thing ever and just looks stupid. The moment Apple dropped Apple Watch 5 with AOD I said fuck it, I‚Äôm getting one. And it‚Äôs cool. I even turned off wrist detection as it displays time and  data all the time anyway."
733,"Yep, I sprung for a cheaper (aluminum, GPS only) Series 6 just to have the always-on display. Don‚Äôt really need the ECG functionality but that‚Äôs a nice bonus.

Apple knew what they were doing; if the SE had an always-on display, I would have bought that instead."
734,"I'm kinda new to this and trying to decide on a good first watch. What's the value of the Always on Display? If I have a watch that lights up when I move my wrist, what other benefits come with the AoD?"
735,"Yep, that was my deciding factor to go with 6."
736,I feel exactly the same
737,Always on is not a feature it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbug‚Äù. I turned mine off pretty fast to try and get my watch to be usable for a day.
738,"Always on, wasting your battery. I have a 4, which doesn‚Äôt have that, when you look at it, it turns on, instantly. I‚Äôve never thought ‚Äúman, i want always on.‚Äù Ever."
739,Why the fuck do you always need it on when you can just raise your arm or tap it.
740,It's a dealbreaker for me too and I hate that they didn't cut back on something else. And since the 5 is only like 60‚Ç¨ cheaper than the 6 I think I'm going for that one.
741,The always on is a selling point to me. I can always see the time and what‚Äôs going on without being obvious. I don‚Äôt mind the wrist movement but I‚Äôm not doing that during a meeting even though I want to see the time.
742,"I get that but if your worried about money, as I assume someone buying the cheapest option would be, than not having an always on display only saves you money by making the battery have a longer lifespan. That‚Äôs already the biggest problem with smart watches. Real watches last longer and hold there value much better."

745,I love it when technology actually solves a problem.
746,"I fainted 7 months ago, and my Apple Watch (whatever the one that came out 2 years ago) caught it. Not nearly as many ‚Äúfalls‚Äù caught as me being rough in general playing sports, chopping wood etc, those are a pain. I got up after I fainted completely dazed panicking to shutoff the emergency phone countdown thing though"
747,As a medical provider the ecg function is extremely limited -- it's no replacement for a full work up which it sounds like he needs
748,"I have the SE iPhone and an S3 watch, was thinking of getting the SE watch too. SE + SE"
749,That‚Äôs amazing! Didn‚Äôt know it had that feature. Might give me Grandmother one
750,"Battery on Apple Watch is so bad that even if the fall feature is 100% effective, you can only use it 50% of the time."
751,"Even with the SE versions, it's still too much money to give to Apple. They're already almost a 2 trillion dollar corporation."
752,"I‚Äôm trading in my S3 for the SE because of the full screen, more storage and better chip. I don‚Äôt need the other sensors."
753,"> The watch is a nice upgrade from my series 3

I never had an apple watch, and I'm just wondering what made you feel like the series 3 needed to be replaced?"
754,"100% same reason I‚Äôm not switching from my Garmin Fenix 5S anytime soon either. 

I need at least a week of battery life out of the Apple Watch before I‚Äôd consider it a daily wear."
755,"I have a Fenix 5 as well and have been recently frustrated by the lack of use of its data points. 

For instance, it tracks my sleep, but setting up a smart wake timer is a nightmare."
756,What if you're carrying groceries in both hands and need to check the time? Wouldn't the always on feature be useful then?
757,[deleted]
758,"Can you let us see the proof of these questionable results, would be interesting to see!"
759,Yes the S5 has the ECG.
760,No reason to get S5. The S6 is $20 more for double the brightness (always-on display) and the O2 sensor.
761,"The new Fitbit Sense also has all that, they actually beat Apple to get FDA certification on their ECG on the watch"
762,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?
763,"A lot of people don't really need the ECG, so why pay more for it?"
764,My big draw is that I don‚Äôt have my phone buzzing away in class; every notification goes to my watch that I can swipe away quick and discreet. Except gmail for some fucking reason because I can‚Äôt mark gmail messages as read from the lock or notification screen even on my phone.
765,Another unexpected amazing feature is walking directions. Using a watch is way more natural than looking like a phone zombie walking while checking a map.
766,I‚Äôm equally shocked. I‚Äôd heard about the SE2 iPhone but never the Watch.
767,Because you're not paying attention?
768,"It‚Äôs worth it for sure! I just upgraded to the SE from my 3 and I‚Äôm so happy I did it. I‚Äôm going to list some of my favorite features for you to see if it‚Äôs things you‚Äôd like 
- having a watch and always knowing the time, date, weather, and air quality all just by looking at my wrist for two seconds 
-tracking workouts is super easy and you can even swim with it on ( I do this all of the time)
- all day battery life 
- sleep tracking ( I use sleep watch and I religiously track my sleep)
- answering calls/ texts from my wrist if my phones not in my hands at the moment 
- Apple Pay is a life saver especially at the grocery store and Starbucks. I don‚Äôt even bring my wallet in with me anymore!
- timers on your wrist so when you need a timer fast it‚Äôs right there 
- Siri available at all times ( I use this more than I ever thought I would )
- you can use your watch to take photos with your phone ( great for selfies)
-can change songs from my wrist 
- can see my heart rate at all times ( I get panicky sometimes and it spikes so I like to be able to see it and calm myself down)
Honestly it‚Äôs an investment but it‚Äôs worth it. I had the original Apple Watch and upgraded to the 3 2-¬Ω years ago and I was really excited to have the SE. so far I love it. I enjoy wearing a watch everyday and I love having so much information accessible on my wrist. Let me know if you end up getting one!"
769,"I adore mine. The SE has 32gbs of storage so I leave my phone at home and use it for runs and taking my dog on long walks (I have the base 44mm gps one). The fitness tracking is fantastic and the wrist notifications make it extremely easy to not have my phone in my pocket when I‚Äôm working around the house. I consider it a remote for my phone while also being one of the best fitness trackers on the market. It‚Äôs definitely an accessory, but one that‚Äôs been a pleasure to have and if you can afford it would highly recommend!"
770,"It depends on why you want one. 

I love my watch because it gives me notifications for calls and messages when I can‚Äôt hear my phone or need to have it on vibrate for meetings. My wife loves hers for the same reasons and she loves the fitness tracking and is excited for the new Fitness+ to come out. 

If you just want it for the status and it was a struggle to save the money, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. It‚Äôs not going to change your life, just makes life more convenient."
771,No it‚Äôs not worth it
772,"I‚Äôm considering an Apple Watch to replace my old Fitbit, sure the battery on the fit bit lasts a few days, but the lack of having a regular routine to charge it, means I often forget about it and leave it on charge for a couple of days..."
773,The AW SE has a more consistently accurate HR sensor than the Garmin and Fitbit in my opinion (tested various versions from all three brands). The AW did best regarding consistent results/readings from the same exercises... not so much for the Fitbit or Garmin. The only area Garmin excelled was additional stats (widely varying) and battery life. Fitbit... poor quality devices and the HR monitors just seemed to be extremely hit or miss :-/

777,Current getting 2 days worth of battery on the SE
778,[deleted]
779,"Yeah, I'm shocked at how much better the battery life is.nyoud think Apple would have figured out a way to incorporate a battery that isn't trash."
780,Well it‚Äôs happened twice this year already (SE iPhone and SE watch) so...
781,$399 for an iPhone SE. Flagship processor and internals just in an iPhone 8 body. Amazing value honestly
782,"No, you would need to get s4 or higher."
783,Can the 3‚Äôs display support the new watch faces? I mainly want a watch for working out but I really like the size of the SE‚Äôs display
784,I think getting the 3 is a terrible idea. The larger display of the 4+ is well worth it.
785,"I just upgraded from 3 to SE and would never recommend 3. No memory, about to lose software support, smaller screen, etc. 
Yes there are people who would be just fine with a 3, but most should just go for the SE as their first watch."
786,Just got a 3 this week I love it.
787,no
788,"Can someone provide opinionated on the positives/negatives?

What didn‚Äôt you like about it? I don‚Äôt have a smart watch but am thinking about it.

I am also not sure how I would use this outside of exercise. Most functions are on my phone and  it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs been problematic using my phone."
789,"While walking, yes its pretty good but while sitting at a desk its pretty slow and deliberate process to trigger the watch so I often end up reading it while the screen is in ""off mode"""
790,It‚Äôs like a $120 jump from the SE to the 6.
791,Get an S4 for cheap or an S5 (if you want an S6 that will be more obviously)
792,Why is the stainless steel worth it over the aluminum?
793,"But how is it an investment if the Apple Watch goes out of date so quickly? This isn't the same thing as stainless steel and sapphire on a classical ""timepiece""."
794,[deleted]
795,That's cheaper than the US price.
796,"Yeah I get about currency exchange. But hear me out, the intrinsic value of a $1 cad is the same as $1 usd. A $10 Canadian lunch is the same as a $10 usd lunch in terms of what you get."
797,It‚Äôs not essential but I find myself regularly reading the time before the display goes in to full on mode.
798,You can get it with one
799,When you purchase it you have multiple options of bands. I got the sport band because if I messed up the wrist measurements it'd suck to have to get another
800,And I want a Samsung watch with the square.
801,"Yep, the s1 can still be used today, but the s6 or se just improve the experience in most ways.


There are advances like the always on display or certain sensors which can be very important to some customers too, but not necessarily the majority.



But how lame would it be if apple sold the s1 continuously, without any advances, for the same price?"

803,"For everyone who wants to get his first AW I would suggest the SE. For everybody who has a AW 3 or higher should go with the AW 6. 
AW SE has a 2 year old processor (what most people don‚Äòt mention) and is missing the ECG. So you basically buying the AW 4 without the ECG with a 300$ price tag."
804,I had a Fitbit for workout/calories. Went for the SE as has the same functionality plus and respond to messages and take calls on it while near my phone so if I‚Äôm working outside my phone is in the house and can still use it. I also use my watch to open my garage door which is just fun.
805,"I‚Äôm personally choosing an SE for my first watch. If I love it, in a year or two I can upgrade for all the bells and whistles"
806,Continuing to not have a watch would be the best choice.
807,"My Series 0 managed to last 4 years before I upgraded to the Series 5. The speed difference is phenomenal, and I‚Äôve had no issues. You can always get Apple Care if you want peace of mind."
808,"It seems like they fixed the glue on the screen since the first one. I wouldn't bother with the SS version, the watch isn't going to last you forever like a normal one would so the aluminium version is fine and will still look good enough by the time you retire it."
809,It lasts about 2 days already.
810,The base cost is nothing compared to the monthly cost of adding your watch to the phone plan.
811,"But didn't you know that manacles are the newest fashion choice?? I am definitely not lanky, but same. Lol"

817,Maybe but they won't be around for long while the SE will.
818,Chronograph Pro
819,"Given the amount of Apple watches, Fitbits and a raft pf other square smart watches, I‚Äôd say people like them fine."
820,Because they are functionally 1000x better. If I wanted a watch that put looks over function I'd wear a traditional watch. The round smartwatches are both ugly and non functional.
821,Does the SE have an always-on display?
822,"I have the 6. I really like the always on display but its not the end of the world. If the price isn't too much I'd say get it. It does make the watch look more like a real watch and not just a black square on your wrist. The battery life is fine, 24 hours of use off charge uses 50% of the battery."
823,Try a complete restore - at least heise.de reported this
824,"Apple Watch won‚Äôt work at all with Android. 

Samsung is your best bet"
825,"The series 6 can work independently, but has to be activated to SOME phone, it just won‚Äôt receive all the calls and texts. It won‚Äôt get any data from Android at all, though."
826,Heart rate is just number of beats per minute. ECG can identify irregular rhythms.
827,"Heart rate measures pulses in your blood pressure.

ECG measures electrical signals from your heart, and there are more than one."
828,"Yes, HRM simply measures how many times per minute your heart beats. The ECG is a graph of the voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart. If the graph is irregular, you may have a heart issue or underlying condition. A must have for folks with heart murmur, heart palpitations, or are generally concerned with their heart health."
829,"heart rate is just pulse. X beats per minute. It's just a number

ECG is the electrical heart rhythm, much more complex."
830,"The ECG does an ECG, while the heart rate monitor measures heart rate."
831,"I'm excited about the mini iphone too. It seems exactly like what I wanted, even smaller than the new SE but with much smaller bezels... I wish it had USB C, that'd be amazing..."
832,Yeah this is my big hang up. I‚Äôd buy this in an instant if it had 2+ day battery life. 18 hours is simply not enough.
833,"But you have to pay extra on your data plan for that, right?"
834,"They're so bulky though. I have a 15$ digital casio, wear it every day, and I feel like I'd scratch a g shock way more just because of the size. And I can buy 4-8 for the price of a cheaper g-shock."
835,Same. But I was looking at some of the higher end models...$1000+!
836,"No, in fact, you can't even use it. When you first power the watch up it just shows a splash screen that essentially says ""Hi, pair with iphone plz"". It literally can't do anything except show that screen until its paired with an iphone."
837,Id go with a new se over used 5.
838,"I see no value in the ECG (mine has that feature) or the O2 sensor. ECG is like an annoying 30 second process that doesn‚Äôt tell you anything and uploads a file to your phone to show your doctor or something... I used it one and never tried it again.

What would you use that feature for?"
839,Those are good features...but they aren't the top reason for most people.
840,"> and accurate

Exactly!"
841,Consumerists
842,having a camera on its body would be the deal breaker for me cos then i wont be able to wear it to work (no camera zone)
843,You mean that it doesn't have an onboard camera? Because you can definitely do audio-only Facetime calls from it. I'm pretty sure it's had that feature since the original S0 launch.
844,It‚Äôs easily the best looking smartwatch out there though.
845,"It turns off when the watch is in ""bedtime"" mode (or ""theater"" mode)."
846,It grabs the sleep schedule from your phone and will turn off the display unless you touch it or the buttons.
847,I understand stand that not everyone is concerned with being active but creating tools to track your health isn't a gimmick.
848,Not if you have an iphone.
849,is that vaguely relevant to the article?
850,Stop thinking of it as a watch. It‚Äôs clearly much more than that. You don‚Äôt need some fancy chronometer to last 50 years either. Any cheap Casio will likely still be working fine in 50 years.
851,"My 15$ Casio works for 10 years without a battery replacement and has functions and accuracy which a high end mechanical chronometer will not have.


A high end chronometer is *never* bought to keep time in these times. It's main function is being a status symbol for people who value that. And also as a fashion accessory... If those two things were irrelevant to the owners of such clocks, an inexpensive quartz digital clock is far superior.

And I also have some *better* mechanical watches, but the casio is my ""daily"" watch I wear everywhere and the mechanical watches are for more formal occasions (where I guess I show off my wealth? ): ).


The Apple watch is a bit of both, because it definitely does offer high tech functionality no classic or digital watch ever could, and it is also definitely used as a status symbol."
852,"‚Äú*My TI-83 calculator lasts months, my iPhone doesn‚Äôt. Apple is so behind.*‚Äù"
853,"If they enabled that on the SE, the S6 wouldn't have any selling points, apart from the oxygen sensor (which is not alot)."
854,"I'm guessing it's also got a smaller battery? Even without always on screen it lasts 1.5 days, same with the S6."
855, If it does turn out to be a software lock the developers in r/tweakbounty and r/jailbreak will probably come up with something.
856,They have identical screens but aren't the guts basically a Series 4? That watch didn't have an always on display either. So maybe it's not the screen that's the limiting factor.
857,"Not really. The Series 6 (and last year‚Äôs Series 5) have a little bit of extra tech in the displays that allow for the display to downclock to as low as 1 frame per second instead of running at the conventional 60 fps. If they left the screen on at 60 fps all the time, the watch‚Äôs battery would be dead within only a few hours."
858,"Is it really? That's kinda a dick move, I always thought that the SE just has a cheaper screen than the S6."
859,The SE would have the same always on brightness as the S5 because they have the same chip (half as bright as the 6). Tbh I bet someone could jailbreak that into watch OS for the SE.
860,"There could be different chip binning, missing chip features and a cheaper battery. A tear down will tell us the truth but it‚Äôs all speculation now."
861,"Is it identical?  Because Apple built some low power tech into the Series 5 to have it be always on, maybe they‚Äôre using the screens from Series 4?"
862,"Kind of like Tesla vehicles.  Everything is there under the $30k car, you just need to spend $10,000 more to unlock the battery in order to go 100 miles more."
863,Where my jailbreak experts at?
864,The SE has a smaller battery but still has comparable battery life as a result. I got an SE (my first full smartwatch) and the quarter second it takes the screen to come on is barely noticeable.
865,"If that‚Äôs true, could jailbreak enable it?"
866,Just wait until they jailbreak it.
867,$oftware
868,"It‚Äôs not just software, there‚Äôs some sort of chip in the S5 and 6 that locks the frame rate to 1fps while the screen is dimmed in always on mode. But that‚Äôs the most important factor in a smart watch to me so sadly I can‚Äôt imagine buying an SE."
869,">Which is honestly really stupid since the S6 and SE have identical screens. It‚Äôs just software locked.

Isn't this a big part of how they make money. You know, pursuade their consumers to buy yet another iteration of something that already exists?"
870,PTS gang
871,"Functionality wise? Sure. But anesthetics are a major reason smartwatches finally took off. Sadly, a lot of people couldn't care less about 2 weeks battery on a watch if the screen looks as unappealing as a sticker."
872,"Argument lost at ‚Äúnot as bright and pretty‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs supposed to be a premium watch, it‚Äôs gonna have good screen. More fitness-only watches can get away with darker screens."
873,I think you can turn it off too.
874,Apple has always been really good at [price anchoring](http://changingminds.org/disciplines/marketing/pricing/price_anchoring.htm).
875,"I think that‚Äôs the thing, they priced it so close to the 6 to encourage people to get the 6 instead. If I didn‚Äôt buy the 3 last November, I‚Äôd have got the 6 tbh"
876,"Is it actually? I've been thinking about getting an Apple watch for a few months now, so I'm curious why the aod is a big deal. Doesn't the display light up right when you raise your wrist, or is there a lag or something?"
877,Got a s5 with LTE off eBay for 350 ... 44 size about 4 months ago
878,">  Aod is a way bigger deal than some people make it out to be.

Is it really, though?"
879,I actually got it specifically because it DIDNT have AOD. I have two little kids and they become infatuated with my watch if the display lights up. SE was the perfect upgrade from my very battered S3 and I‚Äôve been loving it.
880,"I‚Äôm saving up $400 for the Series 7, but when that comes out I‚Äôll probably find myself in the same boat, willing to settle for the Series 6 for cheaper, or really the Series 5 for the AOD. I love that I was able to get the Series 2 from my friend for $100 used, but I‚Äôm ready for the upgrade. So anyway, $400 is a lot to pay, and I don‚Äôt do payments on stuff like that, so I‚Äôm saving an extra $35 monthly at the moment by taking 30 minute lunch breaks (instead of my comfortable hour-long ones) and clocking in, and hopping to a few minutes early."
881,Price anchoring my dude.
882,"What I don't get is why the Series 6 starts at $400 on the Apple store app, not $570 like it does on this site"
883,the fact that you need to raise your arm and have that little delay is reallyyyyyyyyyy annoying. i bet they tested this over and over to make sure it's true and feature locked it. i got other watches without always on display and i absolutely can't use it as a watch. it drives me crazy.
884,"It‚Äôs nice to be able to glance down and see it without having to fully put my arm up. Even with normal watches you don‚Äôt have to go into a look at watch motion to see it. 
It‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me because it‚Äôs honestly not much, but I can see why it‚Äôs favorable"
885,No not particularly. Low light OLED‚Äôs can be incredibly efficient. Most of the power consumption is not from displaying stuff but rather processing stuff using the cpu. White OLED‚Äôs are the most efficient anyway since it is a simple open channel without color processing. Power consumption is minimal
886,"I think it also only turns on automatically if you enter that you are older than a certain age (e.g. 65... not sure exactly), otherwise you need to turn it on in the settings."
887,"I have the Series 4 watch and the fall feature is iffy. It‚Äôs gone off when I crush garlic or flop on the couch, but not when I legit collapsed while running. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve improved the feature. I hope so."
888,I take it you need the 4G version for that? Unless Apple has conjured up some intergalactic black magic I'm unaware of...
889,[deleted]
890,Ah the series 4 the one that was the first Apple Watch to have fall detection.
891,"It's not the ECG I'm after.

Fall detection is a feature where if he feints and falls to the ground, the watch will make his phone call me. If I don't pick up it'll call my mother. If she doesn't pick up it'll call  for an ambulance."
892,No one mentioned ECG
893,"It will last him the full 18 hours without any problems. You're asleep for the other 6, and you rarely need fall detection then."
894,Yeah I care more about my grandpa than the money I give to Apple.
895,Don‚Äôt trade it in! Apple offered me $90 CAD for my 42mm S3 aluminum. I sold it online for $230 within 1 hour of posting it.
896,I might do the same. But should I?
897,Same. I‚Äôve had the SE for a week now and I‚Äôm really enjoying it
898,"At this stage even if you don't need the extra features of an SE or higher, the S3 just doesn't have enough onboard storage. Every update requires you to wipe it, update then restore these days."
899,"If you want a little bit of a bigger screen, new processor, and more memory than the SE over the 3. 

I have a 3. I was gonna upgrade to a 6. But have since decided to keep my 3 another year. 

It‚Äôs not slow, and does everything I want it to do"
900,3 to 4 was a huge upgrade due to the larger screen.
901,It was a few years old and battery life was not as good as when it was new.  The new watch has a bigger screen and access to the new watch faces with more complications.  Plus the always-on altimeter and sleep tracking are a nice bonus.
902,It‚Äôs always a bit funny to see people right paragraphs analyzing why they need a new ‚Äúanything tech here‚Äù
903,"The Apple Watch is my daily wear, it's a superior 'smart watch' when paired with an iPhone.  The Fenix is better for long hikes or other activities, but that is about it.  I like both, and use both for different things.  

I have no issue charging my Apple Watch when I get up.  It's on the charger for an hour and back to 100%."
904,"I find the sleep tracking on the Fenix really bad.  I have worn both the Fenix and the Apple Watch (3rd party app Autosleep) at the same time and the Apple Watch consistently shows more accurate results.  This may vary for others, but the Fenix was so bad I didn‚Äôt bother tracking sleep with it."
905,That never really happens but if it did it‚Äôs not worth the price difference for the two times a year I may need it :)
906,"Fair points, nice that people have the choice now.  Everyone can evaluate if the feature difference is worth the cost."
907,Google it.  People are showing watch results vs proper pulse oximiter results. The top of the wrist is a poor spot to measure O2 sat.
908,Just go read any of the plethora of views. It's inconsistent and doesn't work at all half the time. It's also not medically certified. It's not medically accurate.
909,I have a s5 and have the brightness on medium because high is too bright. I'm shocked anyone thinks it needs to be brighter. on high there's no privacy and when the environment is dark it makes me look like an idiot. there's no ambient sensor.
910,"The S5 is the same as the S6 it just had O2 Sensor only difference, S5 is the best rn imo"
911,"The used market for Apple watches is insane though, I bought a series 5, 44mm excellent condition, LTE, for $230 on Facebook marketplace. I‚Äôm not really sure why but Apple watches sell like hot cakes on there. After finding a bunch of them for dirt cheap on there, I couldn‚Äôt justify ever buying one brand new from Apple, they just charge way to damn much for those things."
912,2nd hand market is flooded with series 5‚Äôs right now. might be a reason to get one for fairly cheap. although I expect the 6‚Äôs to hit the second hand market around the holidays.
913,"Gtk. I was wondering what the price difference was. When I do buy, I‚Äôm selling my S3 to put some down. Less out of pocket. Smarter not harder ;D lol"
914,That‚Äôs cool. I actually got outta my charge 2 to get my S3. Had it for a year now and am PISSED to see that it‚Äôs already practically outdated (not getting any watch faces except the shit ones. Would kill for infograph which would be an upgrade over modular)
915,"You guessed ‚Äòer, Chester. Haven‚Äôt heard that name version of it before ever tbch. But yea, I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt help, even if it gives me a quick little picture.

I do watch my HR sometimes. Hell, it‚Äôs the middle part of my modular screen that I never get off of LOL.

But yea, it was a cryoblation, not a heat ablation so there‚Äôs like less that a 2% chance it comes back... and if I‚Äôm honest it probably would‚Äôve come back by now and I would‚Äôve noticed at least once lol."
916,He wrote that it is important *for him*.
917,[deleted]
918,"They launched it like 2 weeks ago at the September event, you probably wouldn‚Äôt hear about it unless you actively follow Apple product launches tbh since the Air and S6 were much bigger deals"
919,Maybe. Weird that I didn't catch the news for the announcement. Usually reviews come after the announcement
920,[removed]
921,Hahahahahaha
922,You‚Äôre a dumbass
923,"That sounds brilliant! I‚Äôll be sure to look at getting one. I actually have an old iPad I can trade in which makes it a bit easier.

Edit: Holy shit. My iPad which is like 5 years old is worth ¬£140 if I trade it in. If I can trade multiple items in, I could get it for free!"
924,"It‚Äôs kind of wild to go from no smart watch to this. Lots of little conveniences without having to hold a phone. I hated admitting it but it really does help with tasking. I love setting timers while cooking with Siri while my hands are full doing other things or taking a quick call. 

I‚Äôm trying to get away from the Apple mafia but they keep pulling me back in."
925,Do you use the cellular watch or do you not because you find your phone / WiFi is enough?
926,"So I have a couple questions if you could help me :-)

I made a dumb dumb call and recently bought a Samsung smart watch but am an iPhone user. I love the watch but compatibility issues are killing me, so I‚Äôm potentially looking to swap to an Apple Watch. 

-How‚Äôs the battery life? I would say I‚Äôm generally an active-ish user. One of the reasons i had gone Samsung was because of its 2 day life. The sub-24 hour life on the Apple is stressing me out a bit. If I went hiking all day, would it die?

-How long does it take to charge? 

-How‚Äôs the sleep tracking? I used to have a Fitbit that had awesome sleep tracking. The Samsung really sucks for it."
927,How‚Äôs the battery?
928,Could you elaborate why you think that?
929,"I have the series 6 and its very close to 2 days battery life, typically I end up with 65% charge at the end of the day. If you charge it while in the shower daily you should be fine."
930,Happy belated birthday to you too!
931,Best? I dont know. Got an 4000‚Ç¨ mbp which underperforms with hardware (only 4 hours of battery and heat/throttling issues) and software issues (crashes and countless bugs).
932,I think it‚Äôs an appropriate comparison since they are competing in the same space. If you want to be in the Android space don‚Äôt expect a decent watch unless you go Samsung.
933,"I completely agree. I had to replace multiple fitbits, sometimes in as little as 6 months. My Series 1 Apple Watch has never given me a bit of  trouble and has a lot more features."
934,That's why I'm still using a Pebble
935,"My only complaints about my Versa 2 are that I wish they had a beefier OS, and that Fitbit Premium wasn‚Äôt being shoved down the throat when half of the stuff should be basic features. It‚Äôs my first smart watch.

I like that I can just lay down, push the button for Alexa and just say ‚Äúshut it down‚Äù and it locks my door, offs the lights and tv, and starts brown noise to help sleep; but seeing the 3rd party work around app on Apple Watch‚Äôs OS now, I‚Äôd definitely hop over when their battery gets just a little bit better."
936,"I can second this, I just binned my Charge 4 for an SE. The Fitbit was beyond useless, I'm glad I got it for ¬£18 because it certainly isn't fucking worth what they're charging for it."
937,Agreed. It‚Äôs such a smart dumb watch. Serious trash. Have a ionic that has been replaced 5 times. They won‚Äôt give me back money.
938,How long does it take to charge?
939,"What level of use would you say you are (light user, heavy user etc?)"
940,"You can download your podcasts to the watch no?

Like if you are using something like Spotify and I think the Apple service"
941,">  the gamefication of fitness.

My wife seeing my fitness app is what convinced her to order a phone and watch."
942,Also the ipads are all very good value for the money. At least the basic versions (upgrades for storage are way overpriced...). The most basic ipad pro is a very capable device...
943,"It does not, and this is the biggest reason I'd recommend people get the SE instead. The SE will likely also be supported longer due to having the new screen form factor and internal bits."
944,Not really. Some but even those are gimped for the smaller 3 display.
945,Series 3 got the Artist face and nothing else
946,Good counter-point
947,"The always on is annoying it‚Äôs just well...always on. I like when it only turns on when I look at it. Also, there is no real need for one. I only use it when I‚Äôm at work to quickly check a text or respond because I‚Äôm technically not allowed on my phone. I hardly use it if I‚Äôm not at work or running which to be honest I hardly do lol"
948,"For sure, there‚Äôs a lag. You get used to it. The ‚Äúalways on‚Äù feature (should be standard really) isn‚Äôt with an upgrade imo. And there‚Äôs not much you use your watch for anyway, yes there‚Äôs apps, but most need the phone nearby or activated by phone first, so it‚Äôs kind of redundant, just use the phone.

The Watch is fine, but at nearly $1000 (gps + cellular + additional watch bands + protector cases) you can get a good classic time piece that‚Äôll hold it‚Äôs value better (Apple Watch/Android Watches lower in value so much faster) and likely has a better design (fashion) and character."
949,Been trying to find an s4 cheap second hand but everyone asks in store prices like an idiot
950,[deleted]
951,Sapphire glass face.
952,"I dont think they are out of date, the watch series 1 still works perfectly."
953,"Investment in the sense that it does not get scratched, and that your watch looks nice through all of its life. Investment in a better quality timepiece which will not get scratches. 

Not an investment in the sense of getting better returns. Even a classic timepiece is generally a bad investment, you need luck to sell any watch for more than it cost new, unless you buy some ridiculously expensive exclusive limited edition series.


At least when looking at sub-1000$ watches, they all loose most of their value in the used market, compared to the new value. Apple watches are far from expensive as far as watches go, but have a very different kind of market and I don't think they should be compared to classic watches."
954,lolwut: [Apple Watch Series 6](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-6/)
955,you mean this? https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-6/
956,I ended up paying $250 all in for mine
957,"~~If he‚Äôs using CAD, 349 actually works out to about 260-ish USD~~"
958,"it is, and I agree with you.  but it would be nice if they did a little more ppp adjustment than that.  canadians make quite a lot less than americans do, on average."
959,That‚Äôs my whole point : this Watch SE does not have always on display or any other sensor that the S1 didn‚Äôt have. They both have the heartbeat sensor and that‚Äôs about it.
960,Thanks!
961,The age of the processor really is not a factor at all. Its not doing any heavy lifting.
962,ECG is of arguable value and isn‚Äôt enabled in all countries.
963,For sure. Anything you wish it could do but doesn‚Äôt? Wish you paid more?
964,"Lmao you serious

Edit: didn‚Äôt mean that insultingly lol"
965,"I do a lot of work around metal racks and instruments, the glass has paid off many many times.  

I do have the screen glue problem with my Series 3.  Didn‚Äôt with the 0.

The durability frustrates me less than the slow/buggy OS as time moves on."
966,Thanks. Did you turn off any feature or put it on power saving mode?
967,"It is legitimately useful to have cellular, but the cost is what is preventing me from purchasing another Watch. $5 a month would be more reasonable. Or even a discounted price for monthly service to buy directly from T-mobile or whatever. 

My series 1 would be out of range when I was on the other side of my normal to small sized house. It would have also been useful at my retail job I had at the time when the break room walls prevented signal despite it being a boutique store."
968,My 5 lasted me 1 day and had around 20% when I went to bed. And when one of the features is sleep tracking it would be nice to at least be able to get a few days battery life. Charging overnight is it hard? No. Is it annoying? Yes.
969,Thank you!
970,"No, they skipped that feature on the SE."
971,I mean that does sound compelling. Once I have the money and figured out if I am 100% sure I really need one I think I'd go for the 6.
972,"Ah... Ok then, well samsung watch not bad either."
973,I'm assuming the cheaper chinese android watches aren't that highly recommended? The online reviews seemed alright though
974,"Thanks for the info!

Yeah.. Too bad. I guess im stuck to android watches. Which are not bad actually"
975,have they announced the price yet?  I'm really curious about that.
976,I use mine a normal amount with a 30 minute tracked workout and I finish the day on 65% battery. 18 hours would be if you have the 4g version and spend the whole day streaming music without your phone.
977,It says 18 hours but I‚Äôve heard that people are getting 24-48 hours out of it
978,"First 3 months is free, then $10 a month after which is nothing, really."
979,[deleted]
980,"The feature is really only useful for a small percentage of people (basically, those who have afib and don't know it). But since they don't know it....you have no way of knowing whether or not you're in that small group it's useful for."
981,Never thought about that. Guess you can‚Äôt have your phone either?
982,"Yeah I mean video calls. FaceTime with video lol

Edit: yeah fuck me for having to specify. FaceTime is video chat. FaceTime audio is just a dumb name for a phone call."
983,That's a taste thing but I find it ugly as fuck. Samsung's watch-shaped watch with a wheel scroll is in my opinion the best design for a watch so far.
984,I find that this opinion seems to be held exclusively by Apple fanboys.
985,Galaxy Watch 3 and Active 2 still work perfectly with iPhones.
986,"This. The watch comparison is ridiculous as it clearly is more than that basic function. And just like you stated, a Casio will last forever if that‚Äôs really all you need."
987,It‚Äôs not a great deal more than that tbf.  It‚Äôs a peripheral for equipment you already have but you‚Äôre fooling yourself
988,[deleted]
989,"And ECG, new U1 chip (we haven‚Äôt seen the capabilities of what it can do yet), and faster processor.

Edit: SE has always on altimeter, so I removed it from the list."
990,"Well yeah, but the artificiality of that restriction is kind of dumb. Makes sense from a business perspective, of course."
991,"I‚Äôve upgraded from series 1 (!!), I actually find the blood oxygen reading useful, mainly because it records it intermittently while you sleep, and  so should be able to detect sleep apena which i was concerned I might have, or at least did in the past. Getting readings of my book oxygen saturation throughout the night is useful to me."
992,"From a medical professional‚Äôs point of view, the oxygen sensor is absolutely ridiculous. ‚ÄòWorthless‚Äô doesn‚Äôt describe it well enough; it‚Äôs a sales gimmick, nothing more."
993,Is that why my watch keeps telling me to breathe?! Do I have covid?! /s
994,We won't mind at all.
995,The $40 pulse ox meter that goes on my finger which I bought from cvs is more accurate than the sensor on the $400 watch.
996,"An...oxygen sensor?

Seems like an odd selling point. Like, can you breathe? Congrats, there‚Äôs oxygen."
997,Good 'ol crapple.
998,"eh, the apple watch JB scene is *super* limited for some reason."
999,"That‚Äôs typically not how displays work.   The downclocking occurs on the CPU/GPU rendering side, not on the display refresh rate.    This is true unless it‚Äôs chip on glass technology, which is unlikely for this technology class.    If you have other info, I‚Äôd be interested so please pass it along.

Source:   Embedded graphics and displays are my full time job."
1000,"That same screen is on the SE.. as mentioned, it‚Äôs just software locked according to MaxTech."
1001,"It‚Äôs not software locked, there‚Äôs a chip that allows the always on display to be locked to 1fps when dimmed."
1002,"That isn‚Äôt the case for the battery in the majority of Teslas. The FSD hardware works this way though, although arguably the software behind it is worth more than the hardware."
1003,"Standard vs Long range on the model 3 are definitely different battery packs. It's a 50% increase. They might have the same pack shape for manufacturing simplicity but there's no way it's sitting on that much extra range without being paid for. The upgrades are full self driving and a soft lock on some 0-60 performance for the AWD non performance models. That software lock does NOT get it all the way up to the performance model, it only unlocks residual performance from the motors. The rear motor is >200hp on its own (though the torque is software restricted at low speed to avoid torque ripple effects), but adding the (more powerful, no ripple effects) front motor only brings it up to about 350hp. The $2k power bump unlocks the missing chunk given the limitations of the long range model as is, and the actual Performance model has some additional stuff (though the motors are, at their core, the same) to provide the last bit of performance, my guess would be some improved materials to keep up reliability with all the extra torque.

There was one point in time where the model S was selling 70kwh models that actually had 80kwh batteries, but that was for two reasons: They'd stopped making the 70kwh battery pack, and restricting the 80kwh battery to 70kwh usable actually improved usable life (and it wasn't NEARLY as big a jump as the current model 3 standard->long range models). It's why they suggest not charging your car all the way unless you're going on a long trip, which will give you another half hour of driving before you need to stop."
1004,What chip is that? The S4 and S5 have the same exact processor.
1005,"Pebble watches took off and showed great success using e-paper. 

You know why Apple Smart Watch is successful? Hype. A brightly glowing LCD on the wrist isn‚Äôt attractive; it‚Äôs tacky. But Apple marketed it in an attractive manner and like having q-sticks in your ears for music people buy it up.

Transflective looks as good in full daylight and still looks great in ambient light, not at all like ‚Äúa sticker‚Äù. It‚Äôs only when illuminated that my Garmin watch isn‚Äôt at all as ‚Äúattractive‚Äù, but other transflective displays pull it off better.

Lastly, I disagree with charging, because having to charge your watch nightly is a world apart from doing it twice-monthly."
1006,"TBH the screen looks fantastic, sharp, and with the sapphire glass it stays that way. It‚Äôs just not bright, but when you realize how obnoxious bright screens on your wrist can be, it‚Äôs absolutely worth it.

Edit: also to say my old Sony Smart Watch had transflective but with backlight it looked like a normal smartwatch. So it IS possible to accomplish this, but I still don‚Äôt like having my wrist glow."
1007,U can
1008,...huh. Reading that explains why the new iPad Air is $600.
1009,"I got the 6 a few weeks ago, and have turned off the always on display. I upgraded from a 4 and have never had an issue really with raise to wake, so didn‚Äôt see the need after a few days with the 6. The only time I could see it being a benefit is with certain workout types where it‚Äôs harder to raise you wrist to see the watch face."
1010,"I‚Äôve got a series 3 so displays dark unless I look at it and it‚Äôs never been an issue, always turns on immediately, always on display doesn‚Äôt sound like that much of an upgrade"
1011,"From my experience (series 1) wrist detection doesn't work 100% causing you to flick your wrist a bunch or just press the screen. And there are some cases where you would like to check the time and cannot/don't want to move your wrist.

&#x200B;

It's not a deal-breaker to me but I do prefer it if it was always on."
1012,"I have had 2 apple watches for coming on 5 years now (started w S1 upgraded to S4 a few years ago). Never had AOD, wrist detection has always worked well enough that I have never seen it as a sole reason to upgrade further."
1013,It does light up when you turn your wrist and look at it. But sometimes you just want to see what time it is without turning your wrist or at a weird angle. The AOD is a big deal IMO.
1014,it does and it works 100% but with AOD you always have a clockface on the watch whether youre holding it up or not
1015,"I would say it‚Äôs only useful exercising because u don‚Äôt have to straighten your wrist. Other than that, not much. I had the s3 and now an s5"
1016,"It just looks nicer imo, it looks like a watch instead of a screen strapped to your wrist"
1017,I just got the SE a couple days ago and I think it works fine. Just like you said if you raise or twist your wrist it comes on.
1018,"I have one with the always on display and it annoyed the shit out of me, way to bright at night. So I turned that off. YMMV"
1019,"I don't think it is going to be an issue, I am coming from Android and a Fitbit, to iPhone 12 and an Apple Watch SE. The always on display is pointless to me, I don't need blood oxygen, or ECG. So I can save money on things I don't need."
1020,I turned it off when I had the 5. Ended up returning it. Just went to the SE from my S3. Really don‚Äôt care about AOD.
1021,"As someone who updated to a s6 this week, yes."
1022,"I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a deal. You can still ‚Äòglance‚Äô at it, all you have to do is move your wrist a tiny bit for the display to turn on."
1023,"It's on by default regardless of age, at least for the notification"
1024,"I don‚Äôt remember turning it on , but my watch set it off when I ate shit mountain biking in august"
1025,"I destroyed my helmet on a bike ride the other day. Front wheel got caught at high speed and I transferred all my momentum into the pavement with my head. 

I had an odd moment of ‚Äúare these the last clear thoughts before brain swelling sets in‚Äù combined with ‚ÄúI dismissed that did-you-fall dialog out of habit‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wonder if that‚Äôs how I die‚Äù"
1026,"Running momentum probably isnt something old people have, might have been an oversight"
1027,[deleted]
1028,It will also work with wifi only watches. It is just limited to wifi networks like an iPod Touch or iPad wifi only. That can work for some people if they are in wifi coverage most of the time.
1029,[deleted]
1030,Does it send a message to the emergency service to let them know exactly what happened if he‚Äôs unconscious? In my country we have dedicated ‚ÄòCommunity Alarm‚Äô service who install specialist equipment which links to a local social work office with staff dedicated to raising the alarm/attending to assist. Just worth mentioning as a potential backup/alternative option. Although I get that you may not have that where you are.
1031,At the expense of child labor.
1032,How the hell did you get $230 when it‚Äôs only worth $170?
1033,Depending on what you need and don‚Äôt need from the watch.
1034,"Storage really isn‚Äôt much of an issue. Most people won‚Äôt be downloading too many apps to their watch, and will just stream music from their phone instead of downloading their whole library to their watch. I had a 3 and when I updated to watchOS7 I didn‚Äôt have to do anything, I just downloaded and installed. No wiping my watch or anything. It‚Äôs a bit dated, but I think most people would be perfectly fine with a series 3. Especially for people that just want the basics like checking notifications, activity tracking, heart rate, Siri, calling, etc."
1035,"\>it‚Äôs not slow, and does everything I want it to do

This could be said about 99.9% of people who upgrade their Apple gear every year lol"
1036,"I don‚Äôt need it, I just want it.  I like gadgets, and this happens to be a good one :)"
1037,"I have the Garmin Instinct Solar and AW SE. I find the AW to be much more accurate and consistent when not using the GPS e.g. calories burned (activities), steps and distance. The only time I really care to use the Instinct Solar is long distance endurance activities and I need the extra battery life (mostly running)... I have a Garmin Edge for biking... ultimately I think I'm going to sell the Instinct Solar as I mostly wear a watch to track fitness, overall well being, and health... the AW is excellent for this."
1038,"The Fenix makes a solid daily as well. Paired with the Garmin Connect app it keeps track of my daily goals such like steps, floors, etc. I like the face changes you can make too."
1039,Fair enough
1040,"Ah see, you failed to understand the premise of a debate. This man made an unaccountable claim, therefore he is the one who should be providing the ‚Äòproof‚Äô."
1041,Link to all of these plethora of reviews please? As if this was the case it would be plastered all over every android forum. I see nothing of substance?
1042,"Only the always on display part, not the display in general is brighter. Also ONLY in bright light."
1043,"It's the always-on display that's 2.5x brighter. Both screens go up to 1000nits at full brightness, which I agree is more than enough. I leave mine in the middle also."
1044,And a faster chip.
1045,"The S5 is not discounted unless you happen to find a model on amazon which is cheaper because it has more in stock than others and they‚Äôre trying to dump inventory (like the pink one). It‚Äôs still $400 at Best Buy and Walmart IF they even sell it.

Always-on altimeter, two and a half times brighter Always-on display, and BO2 sensor for the same price."
1046,I feel you! I have the versa 2 and the watchfaces leave a lot to be desired. Tbh I‚Äôll probably be switching to the Apple Watch SE
1047,"Your comment caught my eye because I had WPW treated by ablation 17 years ago and just in the past few months have been feeling what I‚Äôll call chest butterflies, but not quite the same symptoms or clearly accelerated heartbeat I remember from my pre-ablation years. I haven‚Äôt gone to the doctor about it yet, but probably should, and you‚Äôve got me thinking about buying a watch with an ECG now in the meantime. Thanks."
1048,You also may not have heart problems that the OP has.
1049,"Ah, makes sense. I didn‚Äôt end up tuning in because I didn‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be any big surprised. Cheers."
1050,"The event was also the same day as the Nvidia and Oculus/Facebook event, so if you are into that stuff it might have been overshadowed"

1053,"I'm not, but ok."
1054,"chances are you'll get a better price selling it secondhand privately, so try that first!"
1055,"Just so you know, you can do most of these things with a Fitbit or something similar. Less features (but can still deal with notifications and everything), much better battery life and way cheaper. Charge 3 is like ¬£80 in Currys I think"
1056,I didn‚Äôt do cellular on any of them. I didn‚Äôt think I really needed it. My phone is always in my purse or somewhere in the house if it isn‚Äôt in my hand so I figured I didn‚Äôt really need the cellular
1057,"If I have my Apple Watch on the charger at night and I wake up and put it on at about 7:30 am it usually lasts me until 9 pm! It takes maybe an hourish to completely charge. I rarely have it die on me before I‚Äôm done with my day, and if I do it‚Äôs because I tracked me swimming which for some reason uses tons of it‚Äôs power ( unsure if this is true on the SE as I just got it and have not swam yet). If you actively keep the ‚Äú track walk‚Äù workout going on the watch during your hike it would die because I think it uses a lot of power just like tracking my swim, but it you‚Äôre just wearing it, and allowing it to naturally track your work out you will be completely fine and it won‚Äôt die on you!
I charge my when I‚Äôm showering or when I‚Äôm just laying in bed watching tv or doing work at home. 
I use the SleepWatch app to track my sleep and I LOVE it. I love it more than I loved the Fitbit sleeping app. I use the free version and I feel like it still gives me so much useful information."
1058,It lasts a solid day and a half for me: I use it probably a little more than average and I usually charge it once in the morning while I‚Äôm showering/making breakfast/morning routine (about an hour) if I sleep with it on.
1059,"This is a major concern for me too...when you say 2 days, how heavy of a user are you? Does that include workouts, app use, etc?"
1060,Never! Happy belated birthday to *you*!
1061,The physical quality of the laptop is just the best though. My dad for example is trying out a bunch of different laptops so he can play WoW at 30+ fps but his main complaint is how the trackpads aren‚Äôt precise and don‚Äôt work as well compared to his macbook
1062,I'm not aware of any laptops that are better at the same price and form factor. I use a Dell XPS with linux for work but its almost as expensive and not as good hardware wise. People buy Macbooks and complain that they aren't good gaming laptops. I expect the ARM macbooks coming out soon will solve the heat issues since Apple is about 5 years ahead of intel in terms of efficiency.
1063,Ewwwww.   The brown noise.
1064,Not more than an hour
1065,"I‚Äôd say pretty heavy! Use it for exercise, maps, most calls and nearly all messages"
1066,"Pocket casts started supporting it as of a few months ago, buts it‚Äôs very unreliable. It only syncs when charging and doesn‚Äôt sync overnight for whatever reason. It also destroys my battery. Spotify I don‚Äôt think ever supported offline playback for podcasts.

Generally I finish the day with 50% including 60-90 minutes of workout tracking. If I go on a 30 minute run and listen to a podcast my watch will die before the end of the day.

So it‚Äôs just not reliable enough for me, I just bring my phone in a arm band.

There is also the terrible performance issues I‚Äôm getting after upgrading OS versions. It got so bad I dropped the Series 5 for my old Withings Steel HR, but went back to it because I miss 2FA and the gamefication features."
1067,"Yeah there really isn't anything like it in the market. I'm a huge fan of the Withings HR Steel and now the ScanWatch. They look amazing and have all the features I need for fitness and the battery lasts for 30 days. 

So while they do it all, they don't have the gamefication aspects as nailed down as the apple watch. Getting those stand up reminders, closing circles, and competing with friends really helps push me into being more active than I normally am.

I went on runs at 10PM at night, just to make sure I could beat my friend for week's competition. So I have a love hate relationship with the watch. I don't think feature wise it's that much better than a Scanwatch, and I think it looks really bad regardless of band or ""trim"", but gamefication is huge."
1068,Even the ipad airs are very capable. I use a 2014 ipad air 2 and its still super snappy. Only issue is no pencil support.
1069,I‚Äôve got a Series 1. Should the upgrade be to a SE or an S5/S6?
1070,"theyre literally nothing alike, the s3 is old, small square screen, on its last os update, slow S3 vs S5 soc, updated heart rate sensor, longer battery life etc"
1071,Lol. I hope you find what your looking for.
1072,Does aluminum get corroded easily?
1073,"eh...this is my 3rd watch, and I have barely made a mark on the other 2 (2+ years with each). I love the look of the stainless, but I can't convince myself it's worth the extra money."
1074,"Ah, I didn't realize the glass was different."
1075,"Didn‚Äôt realize they released it already, my bad, release date just said early October"
1076,Which country and which currency?
1077,I know. That's literally my point. It's $279 in the US.
1078,"Nothing really, I mean at the end of the day it is a watch not a full on phone so no YouTube or whatever lol. I got mine for $250 all in so couldn‚Äôt justify $500+ for an ECG and oxygen sensor"
1079,I haven‚Äôt been able to think of a single thing that could be added tbh. The software is very refined now.  I find the using it for walking directions in the city to work really well.
1080,"Nah, I even use the Always On Display. Sometimes it‚Äôs like a day and a half."
1081,My s6 ends up at 65% charge at the end of the day
1082,The MI band is very good for the price but the price is like $50 so keep your expectations in check.
1083,"No they aren‚Äôt. Honestly not even the high end watches are. Android wear OS is a hot mess and generally crap even in the higher end stuff. 

Samsung uses Tenizen in their watches, and honestly it‚Äôs the best thing going on."
1084,Oh jeez. See that seems worth it then lol. Ugh such a hard decision
1085,"If you'll have it for 2 years, that's 210$."
1086,"Actually , that person is wrong. There‚Äôs a new mode where you can run it without a smartphone."
1087,Locked in a cabinet at the guard post :(
1088,You wouldn't want to hold your arm in front of your face for an extended time anyway.
1089,"For each their own. I don't mind Samsungs approach, but I like the Apple watch style a lot. A square screen also seems more functional.

But I wore a 15$ digital Casio for most of my life. It's square like the apple watch (and that's about where the similarities end...)."
1090,"Yeah, I like the watches that actually look like watches. These other designs are just a guy-in-a-shower picture away from being Google Glass for your wrist."
1091,"See, I think Samsung‚Äôs are mostly ugly as fuck. They remind me of a tryhard kid‚Äôs watch. The one with the digital rotating bezel is genuinely good looking though."
1092,"Meanwhile, Apple watches are the most popular smartwatches out there. I'm sure people love owning ugly stuff."
1093,Android watches/Fitbit/non Apple smart watches paired with an iPhone are a completely different UX than using an Apple Watch with an iPhone.
1094,"Ok, i guess."

1097,Only time I‚Äôve used that was when I first got mine. Haven‚Äôt touched it since.
1098,ECG isn‚Äôt much of a selling point either given its limitations.
1099,"Ah yes the U1 chip so I can unlock my $60,000 BMW that hadn‚Äôt even been released yet and the faster processor because I‚Äôm encoding video on my watch."
1100,"ECG is software locked in Australia so even less reason to get an S6 down here.

We basically pay $250 AUD for an always on display and an oxygen sensor."
1101,Sew would shit on s6
1102,"I'm sure they'll sell it as basically dlc, down the road"
1103,"Side note - if you sleep with your watch on, when do you charge it? I charge mine overnight since the rest of my day I want to make sure it's tracking, but would love to use it to track my sleep."
1104,"If you are genuinely concerned, reach out to a professional. However if you were just reading too much into webMD and the watch helped you settle down a bit, success! I would still ask a professional though. Even if it‚Äôs an over the phone consultation. Glad you‚Äôre mentally feeling better about it"
1105,How so? Genuinely curious about this.
1106,Can you back that up with any proof? Citations?
1107,"You have no idea what you are talking about.

Medical professionals are fucking stupid when it comes to tech anyway and you‚Äôre displaying this."
1108,"It's a blood oxygen sensor which measures the oxygen in your blood. Very useful, if you have sleep apnea, or suspect to have it but don't want to go the doctor just yet."
1109,I think that is because there is such a lack of incentives. There isn‚Äôt much that can be done that reasonable for a watch jailbreak. With a software lock like this I‚Äôm sure someone/group will want to break it.
1110,Which is too bad. I bet there are some clever devs out there that could find some unique uses for that HW
1111,"I was just going to say, the screen being illuminated, even at 1fps, would still be illuminated and draw a lot from the battery regardless. These OLED screens are pretty good though, so as long as most of the screen is black, those pixels aren‚Äôt illuminated, and won‚Äôt draw so much power"
1112,"It may not be typical, but that‚Äôs what Apple have done with the watches that include always on displays. Maybe that‚Äôs their excuse not to include it with the SE and other versions."
1113,A so what class is this your talking about and is it available to the public
1114,"I wouldn‚Äôt trust MaxTech that much about things like this. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre always wrong, I actually frequently watch their videos and I like their personalities a lot, but they don‚Äôt really know that much about what makes tech work."
1115,Wouldn't it only need to be 1fpm?
1116,"I'd like to point out that during Hurricane Katrina, all Teslas in the Pan Handle we're uncapped allowing an even greater distance beyond the range of what the car's distance was purchased at."
1117,"From what I remember, I wasn‚Äôt the processor or anything. It‚Äôs some sort of chip tied to the screen. Sort of a g-sync type of thing. I could be wrong though."
1118,But isn‚Äôt the Pebble dead now and Apple Watch still going on
1119,"While it hurts to say this as a pebble fan, Please don't overestimate Pebble's success. While they definitely sold very well comparable to the initial Android smartwatches, I wouldn't call them as a mainstream success.

Also, agreed on the hype and marketing. But you can be sure this hype and marketing would Not have worked with an esthetically un pleasing watch.

Also, visual comparisons between transreflective and OLED screens say otherwise against your statement that ""they look just as good"". You were probably right if you compared a transreflective display against one of the first smartwatches in the market with incredibly dim and poorly color accurate LCD and TFT displays (looking at you LG Watch first Gen, and first Gen Sony Smartwatch), but modern smartwatches have gotten crazy bright and good. And transreflective displays simply can't hold a candle to them. Just take a look at this comparison of Garmin watches using OLED and transreflective displays
https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-venu-vs-garmin-vivoactive-4-7826

The transreflective one makes blacks look like grays, and colors look dull and flat. Giving it a near sticker like appearance. 

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying transreflective screens are bad. In fact, I still use my pebble time from time to time when I go to the office and even get some complements on it. It's nice forgetting to even charge it for weeks. But if there's an important gathering or I'm going out, I'll always wear my Galaxy Watch with its gorgeous display that can show an adecuate watch face for the occasion fitting my outfits colors with great color accuracy.

Because whether we like it or not, we must accept smartwatches took off because they became in part, a fashion accessory. With functionality second. 

Does that mean transreflective displays are bad? Absolutely not. I'm just trying to see why they didn't take off with the mainstream market. And why what success they've had, are with niche audiences of power users that are the rare kind of people that do value functionality over looks, like you and me."
1120,Tldr?
1121,Basically when I‚Äôm walking with a heavy grocery bag
1122,"Fair, but the always-on isn‚Äôt at full brightness, right? So isn‚Äôt there still frustration with the screen not turning fully bright when moving your wrist sometimes?"
1123,Didn‚Äôt even realize I missed it until I went back to a real watch for day to day use. Having to raise your wrist when you just want to glance at the time is ‚Äî imo ‚Äî a dealbreaker at this point
1124,"It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but it is actually useful for me even though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a requirement. I wear my watches with the band facing outward, so it does take some more effort when compared to wearing it with the band inward. I spent a while trying to find the perfect placement that takes the least amount of movement to turn it on, but it still didn‚Äôt work out very well since I wasn‚Äôt wearing it ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù 

I bought the SE watch, but I just dropped it off at the post office earlier today to return it, so I‚Äôm going to see if the 6 or whatever it is helps out more since the movement did end up giving me a slight strain"

There are lots of posts about this same situation here. The 8gb onboard with less than half usable isn't enough anymore since the OS is growing."
1135,That could be said about anyone that upgrades their phone or smart watch every year. Not just Apple owners
1136,"I'm thinking about getting ine eventually too. I currently wear a cheap 10$ Casio watch, and I'm just used to wearing watches a lot. I like the health monitoring aspect of these, and they're also very sleek and in the end not really that expensive as far as watches go...

But I'd need n iphone for that (my S7 is a bit slow nowadays too). I'm waiting for Apple to unveil the new mini iphone, really looking forward to a fast modern flagship phone which is smaller than the norm."
1137,"Yes, it‚Äôs not a bad daily wear smart watch by any means.  I wore it daily for a few months, have about 10 faces set up on it, have it paired with Connect and other sites.  It works well, it‚Äôs just that the Apple Watch is better still.  The screen is substantially better, it‚Äôs immediately noticeable.  Things just all work better and are faster to access on the Apple device."
1138,"This isn't a debate, it's a reddit thread.

Nobody has to prove anything to you and you were just looking for an argument, so why would anyone bother to spend time getting info for you?"

1143,"Yep yep! Hopefully it‚Äôs not back for you tho fam. I just know I wanna upgrade tho too soon... but that‚Äôs my problem is I‚Äôm gonna have to go all in for a new watch. But yea, first thing I thought of when I read ECG on the new watches and it‚Äôs always been on the back of my mind bc if it weren‚Äôt specifically for gym class, I may have never caught it or spoke up tbch"
1144,"Eh, either way the EKG we‚Äôre talking about here is one lead. Hardly something people should rely on. Further, the one lead EKG is literally only useful for A-fib, not any other arrhythmia. 

As for those without ‚Äúheart problems‚Äù, the ekg may pick up a-fib in some patients. This can be problematic. In medicine, sometimes wide-spread screening isn‚Äôt always a good thing. If a one lead EKG shows a-fib in a seemingly healthy individual, that person would probably want to go get a work up. Expensive, and many times unnecessary, and probably has a low sensitivity for actually picking up an actual problem. That means unnecessary testing. Just some devils advocate here"
1145,"Ironically enough it was supra-ventricular tachycardia at freakin 14 y/o. Got cryo-blated, which means there‚Äôs a chance it can come back (like less than 2%) but it could totally help if it does come back.

The only way it got busted and caught was freshman year of high school. Tho it‚Äôs a very well funded public school, they‚Äôre complete idiots and use HRMs and tell us to be in a specific heart rate zone for a certain number of minutes per class in order to get graded. So here I am playing JV soccer, trying to do nothing to keep my heart rate down... luckily grades got changed (bc I was failing out bc of something I had ZERO control over lol) and I passed all my gym classes. But sitting behind the bleachers texting my mom freaking out knowing that I shouldn‚Äôt be hitting 230+ bpm, that‚Äôs when the problem was definitely acknowledged bc I could definitely feel it that way and couldn‚Äôt stop it.

But anyways that was 7 years ago or so, but yea. For all I know it may not work. But to have a watch that‚Äôll last me a few years with the possible feature to be able to detect funky rhythms... I‚Äôd rather fork over the extra couple hundred obviously."
1146,You‚Äôre dumb enough to answer his question with that question. Lmao
1147,I had a Fitbit before I got my Apple Watch. I loved it! They have such a great battery life. I wish Apple could somehow have theirs that good. Between Apple Watch and Fitbit I definitely think the Apple Watch is worth the extra money though. It can do so much and I think it looks nice on
1148,Thank you!
1149,"I do a 30-60 minute workout with my phone (no gps use on the watch) and I use it for payments, notifications, Siri and other random stuff. 

The only usage that really matters is Always on display (I use it), gps (don‚Äôt use it) and mobile data (don‚Äôt have/use it). 

Under almost any usage other than heavy phone free usage I‚Äôd say the battery will be very good."
1150,is that listening to a podcast from the phone or offline via watch?

1152,"Depends on what is valuable to you. The SE is a much better deal, but the s6 offers more."
1153,No
1154,S5 is basically the S4 processor. So you‚Äôre buying a 2 year old processor. IMO only makes sense if the SE is your first AW
1155,Might just have to bite the bullet and buy a new one but I‚Äôm stingy lol
1156,"It can, water will eventually corrode it; but mainly aluminum is much softer and easier to scratch."
1157,"yes, aluminum corrodes immediately.  but aluminum oxide isn't weak like, say, iron rust, so its really not that big a deal."
1158,"Actually, even stainless steel can corrode easily in some circumstances. Stainless does not mean rust-proof, and when galvanic corrosion occurs, it is usually even nastier than normal steel corrosion/rust.


But to answer your question, aluminium can corrode. The aluminium on the apple watch is probably anodized, so it is already corroded to begin with (controlled corrosion which is also dyed for the colour). The more corroded it gets, the slower it corrodes further (unlike steel which just corrodes constantly, aluminium corrosion is a protective layer).

In some circumstances aluminium can get a very agressive corrosion which is quite nasty (e.g. in salt water, alloy boat engines can corrode badly... maybe something similar on a tiny scale can occur on your hand too, with salty sweat...)."

1164,"I mean, I‚Äôm just assuming for me that since Apple says it‚Äôs the same 18 hour battery life as the series 5 that I‚Äôll roughly end up with the same amount left at the end of the day. If I could go 1 work day then through the night and wake up with like 20% left I‚Äôd be ok probably. I would love to have 2-3 days like the previous galaxy watch."

1170,I found the Apple ad that was essentially ‚Äúit does that‚Äù pretty funny as a good number of the items were already done by previous Series watches. Kinda solidified me going for a S5 instead of either new watch
1171,"Yes I always love when people flaunt their watches EKG capabilities considering it could, at best, be only 1 lead (aVL) and a regular ekg has 12 leads on different parts of the body. You could very easily have a heart attack and your Apple Watch wouldn‚Äôt detect it because it‚Äôs not in the plane of the lead"
1172,"Probably worth noting the ECG hardware has a kind of hidden ability to take your pulse as well. You just put your other finger on the crown with the heart rate app open: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204666 (see the bottom of the page)

It tends to be more accurate than the optical sensor and ""lock on"" faster, it can also update much more quickly."
1173,Have a S5 and use Autosleep. My cycle is charging in the morning around 5am for 20min while I get ready for work. Have about 65% at 6pm after work. Get home and throw it back on charger while I shower and sleep with it. Usually have 90% when I wake up.
1174,"The charge speed of the new watch is very fast compared to previous models. It will also send you a notification in the evening if you don‚Äôt have enough charge to get through the night. I put it on charge for 20/30min in morning and evening when I‚Äôm showering, getting dressed etc. 
As an example, my watch was at 68% earlier after a workout. I showered, got dressed and went to the kitchen to start my lunch. Went back to the bedroom and my watch was at 94%. More than enough for the rest of the day and tonight. 
With my series 1 it was always an overnight charge, but it‚Äôs not the same with series 6. 
A few nights ago I charged it to 100%, put it on in sleep mode, and it had used 7% throughout the night."
1175,"Charge it when you‚Äôre at your computer, or leave the charger in your vehicle and charge whenever you are driving, just some thoughts..."
1176,"I charge mine while showering and getting breakfast in the morning. If I go out for a bike ride after work, then it goes back on the charger in the evening for a bit too(again, while in the shower)"
1177,"My previous partner mentioned that I would stop breathing momentarily during sleep, which is where the concern originated. I believe it was due to my allergies at the time. I have since had immunotherapy (3 injections a month for about 4 years) which has completely cured my allergies, along with snoring and it seems, breathing irregularities during sleep. Appreciate your comment pushing a random internet stranger to not self diagnose. :)"
1178,"The units we use in the field (both in the hospital and pre-hospital where I work) utilize LED‚Äôs‚Äîboth red and infrared‚Äîto measure light absorption by the hemoglobin in your blood...

As one Redditor below so happily pointed out, I don‚Äôt know what technology Apple is using for theirs (‚ÄúReflectance‚Äù pulse oximetry, upon further research, perhaps; I don‚Äôt really care because I‚Äôd never buy this junk) as the typical oximeters shoot light in ~~both directions~~ two different wavelengths (I misunderstood, apparently).

Based on the fact that this technology is not the industry standard (which is already fairly unreliable), and that Apple themselves have strictly stated that their watches *should not be used for medical purposes* (essentially opting out of any claim that they actually work), I‚Äôm comfortable assuming that it‚Äôs all marketing nonsense.

i.e. Don‚Äôt buy the watch solely because it has a toy pulse oximeter. It‚Äôll be fun to play with, but it‚Äôs not a useful medical tool.

Edit/P.S.: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/23/apple-watch-oximeter/"
1179, Can you back up any proof that it does anything? There‚Äôs a reason they don‚Äôt take O2 readings from your wrist
1180,"maybe its a scare tactic from BIG OXYGEN? 

Seriously though if any of these sensors are high enough quality to provide useful medical data it's a blow to companies that charge a fortune for monitoring equipment."
1181,"Random google search will explain the difference from a standard pulse oximeter which shines light through your finger and derives the oxygen level, and the watch which relies on getting the light to reflect back.

In theory, the series 6 watch can do it fairly well (+/-4%, notice a good range is 94-100% so a poor read at a normal low range would suggest that you should seek emergency care), but to get that range on your wrist, you have to be perfectly still which is why some smart watches only measures when you‚Äôre asleep."
1182,"The Pebble is a lot more open, albeit it's less powerful since it's a potato with an e-ink screen and battery and lacks decent health sensors, but people did and do cool stuff on there."

1186,"I don‚Äôt know if you realize this or not: In the article you linked they have the transflective screen backlight turned ‚Äúon‚Äù which does add a hue to the screen and reduces the black.

If you placed both of those watches in direct sun (or even a lit room), the transflective display would appear as black as the OLED but also would likely appear much brighter under sunlight - especially compared to tft/LCD display. Add to that a 14 day battery, winner winner chicken dinner. Also OLED is only as efficient as it displays primary black background. Try changing it to a bright or colorful background and the battery is going to be sucked dry. Not at all with TF display.

What I‚Äôm telling you is that my watch doesn‚Äôt look at all how you describe. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúa sticker appearance‚Äù. It‚Äôs just not ‚Äúbright‚Äù which is a (subjective) opinion over what‚Äôs desirable. Now, consider that Apple has made you think you want a bright shiny thing on your wrist (hence they‚Äôve disabled always-on with the cheaper watch). üôÄ but oh you can just charge it up every night. That‚Äôs convenient.

1202,I don't really think it's such a bad thing to check yourself (~25 euros for a 12 lead ekg) if you think you have a-fib. The ridiculous thing is apple fanboys justifying overpriced watches. I don't think you could even diagnose a STEMI from a single lead of a non professional watch.

1204,"Offline via watch. I wanted to leave the phone at home and listen to a podcast on my run with just the watch.

It does that but not perfectly."
1205,"It's a collection of features, most are done everywhere, but no where near as good as the apple watch. I'll try to break it down to explain why they are so good and addicting.

The apple watch sends you constant reminders, incentives and encouragement to close your ring, beat your target, and overall be more active. On top of that they also allow you to share this data with friends, so you compete to see who gets more points.

This is simple, but Apple did the difficult part. They perfected the balance between annoying and useful and made very smart decisions on which information to present. Active calories for example is a great ideal instead of total, or exercise only, because its abstract enough to cover everyday things like going up stairs but also skews towards exercise.

Then there are nice behind the scenes things. For example, the apple watch easily syncs with myfitnesspal so I can track my calorie goals and activity in the same place. The health app connects with my Withings scale, so it tracks my weight and body composition.

I'm extremely critical of the Apple Watch because it looks like trash, battery life is way too short (gotta charge it every day), and performance is meh. But I keep coming back to it. Before I used a fitbit, microsoft band, Nokia/Withings HR Steel, and Samsung Galaxy Active, they all have pros and cons, but the apple watch nails the most aspects. Too bad it's ugly as sin."
1206,Any 'real' processing gets shunted to the phone...
1207,the S4 is also much faster than the S3
1208,"They are essentially disposable devices. Unlike a regular watch the Apple Watch has a very limited lifetime in terms of usefulness. The OG Apple Watch is about as useful as an iPhone 5 today. Sure it might work for some but it‚Äôs critically outdated.

With that being said I think the stainless steel is worth it if you really like the look, but durability is a mute point IMO."
1209,"Oh man...$50 I would have done. They put a big tag on any part of it they class as luxury. It's also why my watch bands are 3rd party (other than the one that comes with, which is the cheapest one I can pick). I am a bit annoyed I am forced to buy a band with it anyway (so wasteful)"
1210,How did you manage that?
1211,The problem imo with a 2-3 day battery is you don't have a consistent charge routine so it always ends up going flat on you at random times. I had a pebble with a 10 day battery and it would go flat on me in the middle of the day. With my apple watch it has never gone flat on me because I charge it at the same time every day.
1212,"As far as the faster processor goes, what requires that much power on the watch? I've had my SE for a week or two now and haven't noticed anything being laggy. What apps require more processing power?"
1213,"It actually can‚Äôt detect an MI. It can only recognize afib. I think it might register a ‚Äúsee your doctor‚Äù or something though. Regardless, people with the watch probably lean towards younger and able to afford good healthcare with regular visits... so yeah, not sure that one lead ecg moves the needle much besides a couple rare anecdotes."
1214,"2 leads. One on the wrist, one on the finger of the other hand touching the crown."

I‚Äôve been waiting to get some ballpark O2 readings at night to let me know if I need to think about pursuing a CPAP.  I know it‚Äôs not to be used for diagnostic, but surely I can get some relative average readings that I might find beneficial for judging if certain things I do help or hurt."

1222,"Apple states they aren't many eical devices because that would require seve al years of certifications in most of the world where you can't just buy it. And even i. The US it increase the pice by at least 3x for an already expensive watch.

1223,Why is this response being downvoted? Truth hurts?
1224,"I‚Äôve compared it with a proper finger tip blood oxygen meter and the results have been the same from both devices. I‚Äôve been concerned about sleep apena, so having sleep tracking that also intermittently measure my blood ox, even if it‚Äôs just a rough estimation, is still valuable info for me. I see it the same as a home thermometer; just an indication that maybe I might need to speak with my doctor or not."

1226,"Exactly.

Pardon me, u/TeslaRanger, for not having peer reviewed sources for every bit of knowledge I‚Äôve picked up in my ~20 years in EMS...

My proof is in my practice. Thousands of patient interactions throughout my decades of experience‚Äîanecdotal as it may be‚Äîhave led me to be highly skeptical of pulse oximetry readings from any device, let alone a watch.

Pulse oximetry most accurately measures capillary blood flow, which isn‚Äôt done reliably in the wrist.

Since the devices nurses/doctors/paramedics use in the hospital/prehospital setting aren‚Äôt widely regarded as accurate, I cringe to see the people relying on a consumer product for any reliability.

Edit: Words"
1227,"Nope, no moving the goalposts.

Also, there is this thing called false advertising... 

Apple has been very wary about adding these sensors and health monitoring features; the original Apple Watch had more sensors than they enabled because they were not happy with the accuracy of the ones they did not enable yet.

Also, Apple works with the medical research community on medical studies using the AW etc, there‚Äôs an iPhone app to find them/sign up.  I doubt the medical community would be using tech that did not work in studies.

Apple Watch medical sensors or related have repeatedly saved people‚Äôs lives, too. Easily searchable.

So apple gets you to spend an extra $50 for the Pro when the air is probably good enough (though to be honest face id is pretty badass.)"
1233,"I‚Äôve been that way since I was kid. To me, it‚Äôs just awkward to check a watch when it‚Äôs facing on the outside if you‚Äôre wearing long sleeves or something, and in school I would usually sit with my hands together flat on top of the desk, which means I was always able to see the time without moving or making it obvious if I‚Äôm sitting across from someone. I still usually sit that way when at a table, and I don‚Äôt like checking my phone whatsoever when I‚Äôm out with someone, so it helps to be able to see notifications easier too. I also have some joint issues in my arms, so it can occasionally be painful to move my arm in a check watch motion, or just sometimes lock it up.

No. This is reddit and people don't have to prove shit, especially if people are being dicks about it, which you were.

Then ask.. Are these SpO2 watches/meters FDA approved? You'll find in your research that almost none of them are (yet). They may be in future, but until they are, how do we trust their accuracy?"
1242,Oh well yeah no STEMI for sure lol. It‚Äôs only useable for A-fib
1243,That‚Äôs true but 299$ for basically an AW 4 minus the ECG is to expensive IMO. But for everybody who doesn‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs a great deal.
1244,I agree. I have a Series 1 with the gold tone finish and there isn‚Äôt a single scratch or nick in the finish. There are some very faint minor scratches in the glass that you would have to hold at just the right angle inches from your face to see. Maybe if I one of those ‚Äúwear it while mountain biking/rock climbing‚Äù types instead of the home/work/gym people it would be more beat up.
1245,This pretty much. I know a guy using the original Apple Watch now but has an s6 on order and it‚Äôs the aluminium one. There are a few minor scratches on it but he says they don‚Äôt bother him at all.
1246,"And in materials, it barely costs Apple anything more (milling stainless is a little bit more finnicky, but I really doubt it's overall a 5$ difference all in. It's just not a lot of material to begin with."
1247,Shit a 10 day battery life you could literally charge it one time a week. That would be awesome. If I could text from the galaxy watch while using my iPhone I would get one. Either way it‚Äôs not a big deal if I have a watch or not so I‚Äôll just wait for the right one

1256,This is just a common pulse oximeter. It uses light and a sensor to measure how much oxygen your red blood cells are carrying. I'm a paramedic we use them all the time. You can buy one at Walgreens for like $30. Or on wish for like $3. But they don't record they just show what it is right then.. They a normal adult is above 94%. As far as the CPAP I'm assuming you need one for sleep apnea. It is best you just go get a sleep study done.
1257,Its a 3rd party app for sleep tracking

1259,">the reason they explicitly state they are not medical devices is to free themselves from any kind of liability, not because they don‚Äôt work.

1260,look at the other reply to his comment. basically he‚Äôs wrong
1261,"No, but it will help cure society!~~*ba-dum tsss*~~"
1262,"1. Conventional pulse oximeters work by passing two different light beams through a translucent body part like a finger. It‚Äôs not capillary action so much as how much light is absorbed by each of the two beams as it passes through. The absorption depends heavily on the amount of oxygen in the blood. 

https://www.howequipmentworks.com/pulse_oximeter/

2. Watch based oximeters wouldn‚Äôt act in the same way because there‚Äôs no detector on the other side of the wrist, so it might be a new technology. It would be difficult to compare the two oximeter types until the wrist kind is more mature. 

3. Apple specifically denotes not to use the O2 sensor for medical diagnosis, and the feature is only for ‚Äúwellness‚Äù purposes, which could be open to personal interpretation.

4. Using ‚Äúyears of experience‚Äù when one doesn‚Äôt fully understand the science doesn‚Äôt really constitute a good defense. This is especially true because 1) new technology is made available throughout that time, 2) technology matures and becomes more reliable, and 3) previous modes of thought have to be replaced with new modes of thought as new information becomes available.

That other guy saying ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the proof‚Äù is kind of a jerk. At the same time, there‚Äôs always the opportunity to learn and grow."

Sure, it‚Äôs likely not as good of a sensor you‚Äôd use in a hospital but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction. People might not know how to read it.  That‚Äôs why you go see your doctor and let them interpret it. This use of smart watches is a great, maybe the best and most unanticipated use case for the smartwatch. A good thing that needs to be carefully encouraged and used, so long as people don‚Äôt use it in lieu of a medical professional but rather to assist them.

Like other sensors, the information is likely recorded over time by Apple‚Äôs Health app. Which also picks up info from my doctor‚Äôs office online medical records system for my review or use, and I believe the Health app can feed data the other way too, notably things like home BP readings, etc.  Not sure of that one, though. 

Assisting the docs is the key.

An INFORMED opinion is the only useful kind. If you express your opinion but can‚Äôt inform people with facts and detail when you are questioned about it just shows your opinion is worthless.

Seems like in general people forget about exchange rates a lot, when I see other Canadians or also Australians reading news from US sources, or about US made products. It can be confusing sometimes, considering we all use dollars, but anything you see online in reviews and such is probably in USD, so add a bit more to convert to Canadian and add a lot more to convert to Australian, basically. It'll usually equal out to be the same give or take a tiny bit.

Edit: I should note I'm talking from a Canadian perspective. I know in India, Apple devices cost marginally more, even when you convert it. I would chalk that up to shipping fees, considering India is a very competitive market. Apparently Australia has some problems like that too but I wouldn't know. The relatively small difference in price when you convert it is probably just because shipping and such (and also the fact that retailers use static prices, ie $599, where exchange rates change often, meaning price differences can grow or shrink). I'm just assuming mainly here.

Another edit: just an example I searched up. The S20 Ultra is $1399 regular price from Samsung directly. Here in Canada, it's like $1840 or $1850. That's the exact exchange rate."

All I want to know is if the sensor works or not, sorry for asking."
1327,At least you have done hundreds of hours of research and testing in all kinds of conditions with double blind abx tests and comparative testing and written a detailed scientific article of which you will provide the abstract to prove this claim.

1331,"My wife was one of you people. Then, one day, all she got was a red apple logo. Just died."
1332,"Faster is better, but the watch was hardly slow before. I‚Äôd rather see two or three day battery life. The 18 hour life of an Apple Watch is one of the biggest frustrations, aside from the lack of 3rd party faces."

1334,I'm sorry I didn't mean for my comment to come off like that.  Was just trying to say there are cheaper ways to get what your looking for than a new apple watch. I totally get the frustration with our medical system I've experienced it and seen how it can screw over people.
1335,"Yes, but not better than much cheaper devices if you‚Äôre worried about cost. Ultimately, you‚Äôll still need to see a doctor to get cpap if you do have it. I recommend calling again and asking for clarification."

1339,"I agree, but my reasoning is that you only get there with the current feature set by making the chips more powerful."
1340,"I haven't even had major problems, and I have a better plan from what I've seen.  Just after years of dealing with the bs you just get jaded/frustrated, and want to do things yourself.

I just hate how everyone is like ""oh that has to be dealt with by a doctor"".  It's not rocket science.  If O2 levels are dropping below a certain threshold, then there's a problem.  If on the aggregate levels remain stable and within the known acceptable limits, then I know I am on the right track with my sleep.

It seems there are some new options since I last looked for stand alone oximeters with data logging.  This is the first one I came across, which likely has a much better sampling rate than the apple watch.

1346,Liar liar pants on fire good thing thing you‚Äôre a ‚Äúfirefighter‚Äù
1347,I like my series 7.  I also went from the series 3 Nike so it was a pretty big upgrade for me.
1348,Apple needs to work on battery life. Other watches at this point can get multiple days to a week but apple is still stuck at basically a day and a half
1349,"Interestingly, Apple Watch seemed to be the only smart watch that they cared to seriously Review, as much as Samsung is the other biggest player, hodinkee didn‚Äôt give much of care on those galaxies"
1350,"I'm REALLY disappointed with the sapphire crystal on my Series 7. I had a Garmin watch with sapphire crystal as an everyday wear for over 3 years, the bezel was scratched to hell but the glass was flawless. 

I've had my Series 7 for 2 months and the glass is already scratched."
1351,"I accidentally killed my series 4 with an outdoor swim and I've switched to the S7 when it released. It already took a couple of hits on metal, wood, stone but no scratches yet. I did notice that my scrollwheel wasn't working when I was IN an app. But that seems to be resolved with the last update. Overall I'm pretty damn happy with the S7."
1352,I didn‚Äôt realize how much I would appreciate the larger display. The full keyboard is definitely a nice upgrade.
1353,Is it just me or does anyone else not really understand smart watches?
1354,Meh. Garmin is a watch done right. There is no reason why consumers should have to charge a watch every second day
1355,Best stick to automatics
1356,how‚Äôs the series 3 hold up in 2022?
1357,My Garmin Fenix lasts 9 days with always on HR monitoring and similar notifications running.
1358,"As a publication they have to pick and choose what they want to cover. The Apple watch has a much bigger % of the market, and this article would likely be more interesting than any other. The only other smart watch you might see them talk about is the Tag Heuer Connected watch as it's from a marquee watch brand (although not necessarily a brand that's well respected in the enthusiast space, which is what Hodinkee is primarily aimed at)."
1359,Apple makes an effort to be horology adjacent in its Watch branding. The real reason though is probably because Ben Clymer likes Apple.

1361,"Yeah it‚Äôs really a shame. I have no idea how they‚Äôre getting away with this false advertising for years now‚Ä¶.

That being said‚Ä¶ I love my Apple Watch‚Ä¶"
1362,It‚Äôs not real pure sapphire and they both scratch at the same level of mohs hardness. It‚Äôs a marketing gimmick to trick you to spend more
1363,"Really? I always wear my series 4 when swimming at a nearby indoor pool 3 times a week for an hour duration each time and so far have not had any issues. Mind you, I‚Äôm not diving past depths greater than 1 meter"
1364,Just you
1365,"What is it that you don‚Äôt understand? I can see simply not wanting one or thinking they‚Äôre not really necessary, but its benefits and use cases should be fairly obvious."
1366,It‚Äôs a personal taste thing. I like my S6 a lot but I can 100% see why people would have zero interest in wearables in general.
1367,Why not both?
1368,"You say this, after *Hodinkee* of all places gives the Apple Watch a glowing review?"
1369,"It‚Äôs fine for what I needed it for tbh. That said, mine was showing its age visually so I upgraded"
1370,"I upgraded from the series 3 because it started to run slow. The battery life was good, but starting a workout, setting a timer, etc. would all take 10-20 seconds to start up. The series 7 is significantly more responsive than the series 3 and I‚Äôm happy that I made the upgrade."
1371,Mine still works as it‚Äôs intended to work. I don‚Äôt try to use any of the apps. It‚Äôs just notifications. I was gonna get a 7 but realized it‚Äôs faster sure but like‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a watch.
1372,The S3 is great until [this happens](https://reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/sqgxki/farewell_my_sweet_prince_s3/).
1373,Looks like several years later they're still doing the same thing.
1374,It definitely doesn‚Äôt scratch at the same hardness as other Sapphire watches I‚Äôve owned.
1375,"Yeah I also used it for swimming workouts before without issues. But when I was in the water it kept trying to call emergency services. When I tried turning it off it kept turning back on again so it was like the buttons were stuck. Eventually the battery died. I cleaned the scroll wheel and the side button but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt help and when I took it off the charger, after 2-5min the battery was down to like 5%."
1376,"A lot of what smart watches do is serve as a notification bay for receiving and responding to notifications. I don‚Äôt understand the appeal when you could just use your phone for this which has a much bigger screen and is going to be a much better user experience.

The fitness tracking is cool tho. I can see and understand the appeal with that."
1377,Probably fluff piece
1378,Damn that‚Äôs a long time. I was thinking of buying one for budget reasons but I can‚Äôt seem to give up my mechanical watch again.
1379,">	I was gonna get a 7 but realized it‚Äôs faster sure but like‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a watch

Yeah that‚Äôs the reason why I just wanna buy a 3 and just be happy with it. Btw, how‚Äôs the battery?"
1380,Oh man! How long did you have it for?
1381,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm afraid of‚Ä¶ That one day the water will somehow manage to penetrate the seals. Ah well. I‚Äôll keep at it and worry about it when it does happen.
1382,I have a Series 4 and that side button occasionally wants to get stuck. I've had a couple close calls with emergency SOS. I'm afraid one day I may not be able to get it unstuck in time.
1383,Personally I love the freedom of leaving my phone at home when I go for walks or quick errands to the store!
1384,Listen to music at the gym. Phone calls when APs connected. Set timers and alarms. Fall detection - how much that soothes the other half. Apple pay. Travel. A quick glance at your wrist instead of getting your phone out and unlocking it
1385,"I‚Äôm with you. Someone gave me one as a gift (didn‚Äôt ask for one) so I tried it for a few weeks. I hated how I was even more addicted to technology while wearing it. Like even if you intentionally leave your phone in another room, the watch is still there lightning up every 5 minutes. 

The fitness tracking is also so, so overrated at least for my purposes. I frequently use the Strong app on the iPhone which is far more useful than the gimmicky watch features.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on trying to browse apps with photos/text. Like reading a postage stamp.

I gotta hand it to them though, my friends that love it are literally addicted to it with their fitness challenges. Spoiler: none of them have gotten any more fit."
1386,"Can get time with an awesome all time on display(like other watches), the most important thing.
Can track a run,  get direction, pay without picking a phone, use as a kitchen timer, calculate an amount of water, get today's weather and degree.
It is smart enough for me."
1387,"You don‚Äôt have to take your phone out of your pocket. Especially useful if you‚Äôre working or busy doing other things. 

Fitness tracking. 

Using it to check the time. 

App integration with Maps, music apps, etc. 

It‚Äôs not so much that it‚Äôs trying to replace the phone, it‚Äôs just a quicker and more convenient initial triage of what‚Äôs hitting your phone."
1388,Go read their first review of the Apple Watch. They seem to really like the watch despite also liking automatics
1389,"Still lasts about 1 1/2 to 2 days. It‚Äôs the SS one if that makes a diff. My wife had the aluminum s3 and it became so slow and wouldn‚Äôt update but mines been fine. She has a s6 now. 

I wouldn‚Äôt buy a 3 currently. You‚Äôd be better off buying a SE"
1390,A solid 4 years. It lasted and served me well.
1391,You can disable that feature in the settings of the Watch app or on the Watch itself
1392,"Stuff like setting alarms, fall detection, payment, _that_ i can understand and probably even use. But as a music player? Phone calls? What significant benefit is there to doing that on a watch instead of my phone?"
1393,"Yeah. In general smart watches act as a ‚Äúdumb terminal‚Äù to your phone.

The things smart watches mostly do (provide a quick method of seeing and responding to notifications) doesn‚Äôt interest me and the things that do (fitness tracking) arn‚Äôt big enough to justify getting one.

Personally i see the potential in these things to control stuff like smart appliances. Some novel and practical stuff needs to happen with smart watches to get me interested"
1394,Yeah but it‚Äôs $250 AUD more. I don‚Äôt want to spend that much and the S3 is only $299 brand new.
1395,"Well if you go out for exercise, you don't need to carry your large phone with it. It's one use case.

Doesn't mean you'll need all those uses cases, but some people do."
1396,"The watch has full controls for the music from your phone. You can also download music onto the watch. Great for the gym or you forget your phone.. No getting phine out of pocket and negotiating if it want passcode or is happy with face with a mask. don‚Äôt need your phone to Apple pay.

oh. It tells you the time."
1397,"Sending texts, setting timers, starting the car are all easier and faster than fishing my phone out of wherever it is. And I monitor the sleep and heart data daily."
1398,"I don‚Äôt live in Australia but looking at jb hi fis website your 299 s3 is the smaller 38mm and the smaller SE 40mm is 429

I get the reasoning. But again the s3 is 4-5 year old tech. Spending 300 on something that old seems kind of silly. Especially if the watchOS update taper off in the next year or so."
1399,Yeah I drive an ancient shitbox with no infotainment system and it‚Äôs much safer and convenient to control music from my watch than taking my eyes off the road to fish for my phone
1400,"Oh I didn‚Äôt even realise about the size, stupid me. I‚Äôd need at least 44 cos I have big wrists."
1401,"Looks like you put plenty of research into your decision, this is really unique so congrats. Many users jump into buying the latest apple watch for big bucks and get disappointed because stuff does not work as they imagined. However, it‚Äôs risky to post about this stuff here with many fans of the original product, so I imagine it will be reported by some users‚Ä¶Still happy for you for finding a watch suitable to your needs, however looking at the actual product, I think you were quick to dismiss the idea of trying out a used AW3 to get the feel of the platform that was designed to integrate seamlessly with your other apple products. You wrote that AW3 looks ‚Äúold‚Äù, well compared to your pic, to me the AW3 still looks like a much better choice, the bezels seem enormous. Anyway, cheers on your research, I doubt the post will stay up here, which is unfortunate becasue it might help others."
1402,"First of all thank you for a super interesting post. 

Some of these border on being replicas so I can‚Äôt condone them. 

But I do appreciate China doesn‚Äôt have copyright laws and that not *everyone* can afford Apple prices."
1403,"Well I don‚Äòt see the point of a series 3.
It actually has less different digital watch faces, will not get any software updates soon, costs more (will be dead/need battery replacement in 3 years too) and has a display with corners.
This display has a quite thin bezel on 3 sides (top is the same as sides), just the lower one is bigger.
Compared to s7 they are big, compared to s6/se not so much.

The post is not against any rules here so it should be fine.

I think it‚Äòs important to explain people what these actually do and what not so you can do a better decision also against these e.g."
1404,For me it‚Äôs the asymmetrical bezel. Why is it thin on the top and super thick on the bottom?!
1405,"Thanks.
It‚Äòs fine if people are against it. I mostly appreciate them making an apple watch se light if you want to call it that way.
Ultimately a product that apple doesn‚Äòt offer: way less features for way less money.
You get what you pay for and if you don‚Äòt need so much, why pay for a lot you don‚Äòt need :D
I just want the comfort of the watch bands.
Turkey btw has always been big in mimicking products too, it‚Äòs not only china.
China just overtook them."
1406,"Yes 3 quite thin sized bezels and one big one at the bottom.
The 44mm watches have way thinner bezels all around but not 40mm yet :("
1407,"I know what you‚Äôre saying but I wish the icons, designs etc didn‚Äôt copy Apple üòû 

But even huge Chinese companies copy Apple without any shame: https://www.gizchina.com/2022/01/09/xiaomi-when-will-you-stop-copying-apples-ui/"
1408,"I don‚Äòt think ui design is protected otherwise they/apple can just prohibit them from selling in different countries other than china.
It seems it‚Äòs legal worldwide what they are doing.

It still doesn‚Äòt matter though really since it‚Äòs the same as here: it‚Äòs cheaper but it has less features.

For my phone I prefer iPhones too since I want the ecosystem and iOS and no china copy can and will reach there.

They are producing cheap okay phones and that‚Äòs good for people that don‚Äòt have so much money or just want a basic phone imo.

Often one are paying with their data then if that‚Äòs not a problem for them. Same probably with this watch, just that there is not much real or useful data besides steps and sleeping data (I don‚Äòt allow gps)"
1409,"Yes, UI is protected. [Apple sued Samsung](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17510908/apple-samsung-settle-patent-battle-over-copying-iphone) for copying the iPhone‚Äôs Home Screen. 

And yes, Apple can prohibit sale of iPhone/Apple Watch copies (hardware or software) in any country where copyright laws exist. It can also [ask  government agencies to seize them](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/331000-worth-fake-airpods-seized-cbp-officers-louisville) when they‚Äôre being imported. 

So the watches you‚Äôre listed are illegal. But Apple doesn‚Äôt go after small companies, so it‚Äôs up to each person if they want to buy a product that copies an Apple product. 

Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt want someone copying my work and profiting it from it, so I would never buy a copy - I would rather not have it, until I can save money to buy the real thing."
1410,"When Ui is protected, why are Xiaomi phones still sold here?

Importing third party watches for private use is not illegal here as long as they don‚Äòt put any fake brand logos on it.
It‚Äòs a third party watch and not an apple watch.

If you don‚Äòt want any company to profit from apples development you also can‚Äòt buy any third party watch bands from amazon etc. If you happily pay 100‚Ç¨ for a plastic watch band that costs all in all (R&D, production, sales) max 5‚Ç¨, nobody is stopping you.

Third party products only work for overpriced stuff otherwise they couldn‚Äòt afford to produce them. They still make money with 3‚Ç¨ watch bands...

I have an iPhone and Airpods Max myself because I want the best product in this case but with an apple watch it‚Äòs simply different."
1411,"Short answer is because they don‚Äôt sell enough phones. See this article [Apple should sue Xiaomi for its blatant copying ‚Äî but it won‚Äôt](https://www.cultofmac.com/636604/how-xiaomi-gets-away-with-copying-apple/). Also [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Apple-sue-Xiaomi). 

A product doesn‚Äôt need to have a logo to be considered a fake. If the shape is similar - not even exact but similar - is can be considered an attempt to copy an original. 

A fake product for private use is still an illegal, fake product. 

Aldo, it doesn‚Äôt matter what a product costs. If an original band costs $100 and costs $1 to make it doesn‚Äôt matter. Don‚Äôt buy it. 

If you buy a fake for $5 instead then you‚Äôre supporting an illegal market. 

But, bands are an irrelevant example anyways because Apple publicly provides the schematics to third parties to create bands for free.

If you want to buy fake products that‚Äôs up to you. 

As I said in my original reply, they‚Äôre not for me. 

Instead of trying to defend companies that illegally rip off the work of other companies, just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind buying fake products.‚Äù Honesty is better."
1412,"As I said it‚Äòs legal to import the mentioned products for private use.
‚ÄûI don‚Äòt mind buying fake products‚Äú is literally the whole content of my original post lol.
I explained in detail why I opted for it in this case.
It‚Äòs an explanation why people do this. You don‚Äòt have to agree with me obviously but argumenting against it will not change anything either."

US Customs defended itself by stating:

Apple has configuration trademarks on their brand of earbuds, and has recorded those trademarks with CBP. Based on that determination, CBP Officers at JFK Airport have seized the shipment under 19 USC 1526 (e). CBP‚Äôs seizure of the earbuds in question is unrelated to the images or language on the box. A company does not have to put an ‚ÄúApple‚Äù wordmark or design on their products to violate these trademarks. The importer will have many opportunities through the adjudication process to provide evidence that their product does not violate the relevant recorded trademarks.

Stop trying to make excuses. None of the arguments you‚Äôve used to convince yourself fake products are legal are true. Just be honest."

1421,"I can afford it. I am in the Apple ecosystem. So yes, it‚Äôs good.

If I needed to go out of my way to afford one, I wouldn‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt really use it actively. I use it as a passive activity tracker, weather checker, timer setter, and sleep tracker. Also notifications,"
1422,Working out without your phone is a game changer.
1423,"If my current Watch broke, I would order a new one on the same day, so yeah, I think it's worth it. The hard part about explaining the appeal is that what I like about it is all the small things it does, all the time - for me, there's no singular killer feature that justifies it, but the sum of all the things make it worthwhile."
1424,"Worn one every day since S0.

It changes your relationship with your phone in subtle but profound ways. Counterintuitively, an extra device allows you to be less connected. When paired, your phone no longer vibrates ‚Äî you get a little tap on the wrist for notifications. You can glance at it, and act on it immediately or disregard it. No more pulling out your phone to reply to a text and then, while you‚Äôre here, check your email and maybe quickly refresh Instagram and get sucked into a rabbit hole on your phone.

There‚Äôs much less anxiety about being away from your phone. 

Plus, it‚Äôs a wonderful motivational tool to get moving more. The rings were among the most brilliant innovations in the product: instantly iconic, nonjudgmental, and thoroughly motivational. If you‚Äôll let it, it will help you live a healthier life."
1425,"The answer is depends. It is definitely not ""worth"" $350 in the sense that I used to workout a ton and was able to do everything in my life, without an apple watch.

It is a luxury, but I would say if you have spare money, and you fit the target market, it is nice to have. I would say target market are the following people

1. People who use the phones too much: settle your notification/checking/internet anxiety by having a little electronic thing on your wrist that removes your excuse to look at your phone.

2. People who want to carry less: w/Apple pay I can buy food/groceries/snacks/shop without my phone, like on a run, hike or if I leave my phone in the car. I have access to my calendar at all times. If you get the cell version, you can leave your phone at home for the day.

3. People who hate taking their phone out for little things (short texts, check weather, read texts, cooking timers etc): it is so convenient to text with no phone..unless you text a lot, then it can be annoying. 

The watch has 4 key functions IMO: workout tracking, texting/phone call via Siri, Apple pay, weather, timers/reminders. Those 4 things make it really nice to have. Unlike a phone, you have to have it on you at all times to really get used to it.

The newer versions are also much nicer then the old ones. I had Gen 2, it was so slow and buggy I hated it. Gen 3 was pretty good, a glimpse of potential. Gen 5 is the first one I felt hasn't been lacking in any department."
1426,"For health features you could buy a Garmin or fitbit and this would give you some good health stats, especially the Garmins.

Be selective with the notifications the watch receives and it is incredibly productive - no need to keep checking your phone for important notifications because you‚Äôll have had them delivered discretely to the watch (haptic notifications are more subtle than the likes of garmin).
It‚Äôs nice for example to drop in walking directions in an unfamiliar city into your phone and let the haptics on the watch then guide you. Different taps for left and right and delivered at the point you need to turn."
1427,"I like it. 

I‚Äôve used the built-in workout tools and 3rd party apps to help me lose 45lbs. I‚Äôm not sure I would have made it without the help/reminders it provides. 

After that, oddly my next most useful apps are the timer and reminders. I know I could have done that with my phone but I‚Äôve had a phone for years and never used either but now that it‚Äôs on my wrist I use them all the time."
1428,"At first, I loved having all the features and notifications on my wrist. But I still found myself pulling my phone out for most things. Siri on my S3 became so slow and unresponsive that I flat out turned it off. I took the complications off my watch face except date and weather. I find myself wanting to disconnect more apps from my watch more often than I use them.  

It's a nice workout companion, especially if you can't bring your phone around with you when you do whatever you do. But for everyday wear, I really think I'll spend $400 toward a Hamilton or something nice instead of an S5 or S6."
1429,"I bought mine as a fitness watch. I run a lot, so when I leave my home I like to not bring my phone. Load up a podcast and go wild without carrying a big ol rectangle. It‚Äôs been very convenient for that reason alone (I can even swim laps with it!!), but the metrics have been supremely helpful as well. The activity rings have pushed me to put in the effort to move on multiple occasions without being pushy enough to make me work out JUST to close the ring. The metrics are really cool to look at after you have some historical data! 

However, I personally don‚Äôt use mine for much else. I deliberately disabled notifications on mine. There are lots of use cases, but it has changed the way I feel about my workout so much that it was worth the cost of entry for that alone. 

Sure it could be considered a ‚Äúgimmick,‚Äù but the very light gamification of rings and medals provide a light enough push to make me that much healthier without being a jerk to me when I don‚Äôt want to be!"
1430,"I‚Äôve gone through phases of wearing it religiously and not at all. I‚Äôm definitely more active and push myself with it. It sounds silly but in workouts I find my myself competing with myself, it‚Äôs nice to track heart rate targets and so on. Also downloading playlists and not taking my phone is legitimately amazing. 

Out and about it‚Äôs pretty good, I like being able to glance at it rather than my phone. It allows me to filter important/none important things discreetly enough that I‚Äôm not being rude. They can look pretty good with the right bands. Most of it I class as a nice to have luxury, but I mainly value it as an amazing fitness tracker. 

But I have only ever bought one brand new, then I went to buying the year behind models just to bring the value proposition more in line with what I want it to be. If you‚Äôre unsure of value it might be worth looking at a series 4 or maybe even 3. The 4 is basically a 5 without always on (same CPU, same body) the 3 offers 80% of the functionality and is still sold by Apple new so you will get some good life out of a brand new or second hand one for a pretty low cost."
1431,"Absolutely yes.

* Discrete notifications
* Activity Tracking
* Easily accessed music controls

Charged at night, worn all day.

Started off with a S0, upgraded to a second hand S3 when the S0 stopped being supported by the current watchOS."
1432,"I just one over the holidays, and it‚Äùs been a godsend. 

It‚Äôs simple to track workouts with the native workout app... every dog walk gets tracked even if I don‚Äôt grab my phone. 

Every flight of stairs. Too. 

My daily average steps have increased by over 2,000 just because I don‚Äôt always keep my phone on me. 

And it‚Äôs coaching/encouragement is great too. 

And that‚Äôs just the fitness stuff it offers. 

Everything else is super handy too."
1433,Apple Watch series 3 onwards might be worth it. My series 0 wasn‚Äôt in my case but it was the first gen product.
1434,"I was in Istanbul Airport, sitting myself in massage chair, and my iphone gone! Really fortunate that 5 airport staff find it one month later. Imagine having an Apple Watch, you spend 300-500‚Ç¨ not only for your watch, but essentially give boost to your apple exosystem and could save your iphone worth of +800‚Ç¨"
1435,It‚Äôs well worth it for the health features alone.
1436,[deleted]
1437,I wasn't into smart watches at all. I like watches to just tell time and that is it. I picked up a Apple Watch 5 because I wanted to be able to quickly without my phone control my house via homekit. Since I got the watch I love it. I don't use always on face and I get 3 days out of it before I need to charge it again. I have the wifi version not cellular also. I love how it shows me all my notifications and I love the stand and move. It is actually making me get up more via my IT job and I love that. It also works nice with maps and navigation where it will vibrate different when a different turn (left or right) is coming up and it just overall has been a great experience. I would say 100% get one if you have an iPhone and have other apple products because it just seamlessly syncs between them all.
1438,"My 2 cents: It's a great product but you got to see how much friction it adds to your life. I had the series 0,2,3,4. They all ended up being sold. Reason? All the activity features, notifications and whatnot weren't really making up for: having to charge it every day, having to bring one more charger/cable (and therefor have multiple devices charging in different points of a hotel room) with you wherever you might stay more than a day and last but maybe the most important part, there is still no screen that has the same ""under the sun"" visibility as a classic mechanical watch."
1439,"This is a weird one for me. I didn't need an Apple Watch, yet after I bought one to try, I can't live without it..."
1440,"The two things I love the most: getting to put my phone on silent and not missing calls and notifications, and the fact that I can put my phone on the charger in the evening when I‚Äôm hanging out with my wife or watching TV. I won‚Äôt miss any phone calls or text messages and I don‚Äôt have the distraction of my phone on me checking social media, etc"
1441,"Yes.  
I‚Äôm deep in the ecosystem and use it for messages, phone calls, reminders, music and activity."
1442,"I have one but am probably selling it. I‚Äôm pretty physically active so I don‚Äôt need  my watch to tell me my metrics other than using a stop watch for tracking my rest intervals. I hate notifications on my wrist as I‚Äôm trying to be more present with my kids and family. I know I can turn off notifications but it is just another thing I have to manage. Also I like to travel minimally but the Watch necessitates packing another unique cable. I purchased a $10 Casio F-91W and honestly have not missed my Watch at all. 

The only exception is music while I am at the gym. Now I have to carry my phone with me but that is not that big a deal as I carry my workout log, a pen and water bottle with me anyways."
1443,It‚Äôs worth what I paid for a used one. It isn‚Äôt worth what they charge for it new. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre about 50% overpriced.
1444,"It‚Äôs worth it but don‚Äôt get the one with cellular data unless you are without your phone constantly or you like running and won‚Äôt take your phone with you

I like that I can connect my headphones straight to the watch and listen to music and the walkie talkie feature is also really fun!"
1445,"Well, I had the original Apple Watch (Series 0) since 2016 and while I enjoyed it a lot in the beginning, it was never supposed to last more than a couple years since the processor they had in it was a single core. And while the other generations of the watch looked cool, I didn‚Äôt feel it necessary to get them. But once series 4 dropped, I instantly wanted it cause that shit looked sexy as hell but still decided to wait it out till series 5 and finally upgraded from my dying series 0 to the series 5 a couple months ago. And well, maybe it wasn‚Äôt for me but I honestly felt that I was doing perfectly fine with my old series 0 and I wasn‚Äôt really benefiting much from the power and tech that‚Äôs in the latest watch and honestly, the price also made me question the purchase (being a college student will make you question every single dollar you spend lol). So I‚Äôm returning it and sticking with my trusty series 0 for a year or maybe even a couple more. So in short, I‚Äôd say it isn‚Äôt worth its asking price but if you can get one for a decent discount, then why not go for it."
1446,"I use Apple Pay all the time. I stopped bringing my wallet. Most of discount cards with QR codes work too.

Remote control for music or Apple TV are also quite convenient and close by.

I also use it to copy TOTP one time codes to pass 2 factor authentication."
1447,"I tried it, but it wasn't for me. I don't like checking my phone often so yeah."
1448,Eh.  Never made the must have list here.
1449,Meh. Not really.
1450,"I thought about it for three years before jumping the gun and buying one. 

I have enjoyed gamifying my workouts a little bit more and tracking things. I love data and numbers, so this made it quite fun for me. Plus, my friend bought one and we shared our activity to compete. It brought more reasons to rack up the numbers lol"
1451,"Haven't used mine in weeks. It was cool, in the first month, then I found myself using it without battery and realized I don't really need it."
1452,"I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù an Apple Watch until I went out and bought one. It has taken care of so many tiny/simple problems for me that if I lost it now, I would be running into multiple inconveniences everyday. I‚Äôm a forgetful college student, so for me 1) the feature that allows you to set off a ring/tone on your phone so you can hear and find it is a LIFESAVER 2) I like to have my phone put away so I can be present while I‚Äôm in class, out with friends, etc. Being able to read a text preview on my watch the second it arrives is really nice and allows me to see what people are saying but decide to respond at a later, more appropriate time if it‚Äôs not urgent. If you have the money, get one, it‚Äôs a game changer. If it‚Äôs not affordable, eh. You won‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing. I bought mine from Apple refurbished, been a few years I can‚Äôt remember what series but I haven‚Äôt had any problems with slowness or glitching."
1453,"Only for working out. The novelty wore off pretty quickly for me since the apps are very barebones and the functionality is there just to offload your phone usage. 

But it‚Äôs awesome for working out. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth paying premium just for that."
1454,"Silent alarms are wonderful. Having a new baby in the house, it‚Äôs fantastic using the watch to wake me up via haptic feedback.  
  
I also use it for silent alarms to remind me of meetings throughout the workday.  
  
Other than that, I use it big time to change the audio levels for my AirPods."
1455,"Worth it to me.

-	Check time
-	check notifications
-	control music
-	fitness tracking
-	check weather
-	set timers
-	and occasional respond to texts/answer calls


Also, with my leather strap, it‚Äôs a good looking accessory."
1456,"I never wanted it until it was gifted to me so I tried it out. I wouldn‚Äôt go back now. For those who like the fashion aspect you‚Äôll likely accumulate 3ish bands and it can be fun to mix and match with outfits. It‚Äôs very convenient for checking text, calendars, and emails without rudely pulling out your phone while talking to someone; just glance down and see who the notification is from and decide if it‚Äôs important enough to read in full or comeback to after you finish what you‚Äôre currently doing. 

Closing rings is very addictive despite most thinking it wouldn‚Äôt matter to them. Honestly, I find it fashionable and more functional than analog watches. When I see analog watches on people nowadays, I see it as purely a fashion statement (assuming it‚Äôs an expensive enough watch that they could afford a smart watch). I care about my fashion like everyone else, but I don‚Äôt admire contrarians or people who grandstand about ‚Äúthe timeless style of a classic watch.‚Äù They same logic doesn‚Äôt work for top hates, pocket watches, monocles, etc."
1457,[deleted]
1458,"FYI, as with every product, those who purchase a product are more likely to say good things about it‚Äîespecially if the protect is mediocre. Of course I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here, just to be careful that you don‚Äôt take everything written here as fact."
1459,This thread wont be good for my wallet
1460,"I sold mine. 

Bought the S0 on release day and gave it back to Apple.

Tried again with a S3 LTE on release day as well.
It was pretty nice. I could go to the gym without my phone, just the watch and AirPods. The issue was battery and speed. So often it would hang, so often the battery wouldn‚Äôt allow me my full routine at the gym. But it was still pretty nice.

I‚Äôve enjoyed it for one year, then as soon as I stopped going to the gym, I had zero use for it.  

You have to cater a lot to your watch. And it‚Äôs slow to do pretty much anything IMO. I know the latest series are faster, but can‚Äôt really speak about that."
1461,Have had my Series 2 for 3+ years and it‚Äôs one of the greatest purchases I‚Äôve ever made.
1462,"I have been using my GPS Series 3 since launch every day, I use it when running and lifting to track my workouts and it also gets everyday use for not getting my phone out to control music/see texts/ whatsapp/ weather/etc.
Battery life is still good I use it to track workouts for over an hour and a half each day, half of them with GPS, and I still get over 50% battery before charging every night.
So in my case, totally worth it and one of the best Apple products I have owned."
1463,I think so. I was of the mindset that I didn‚Äôt need one until a friend loaned me his old one when he upgraded. Now when I forget to charge it or don‚Äôt wear it I‚Äôm finding I miss it.
1464,"I did not wear watches before getting an Apple Watch. I had no intention of ever buying one, but I started dating a girl who had one and the more I saw her using it, the more I thought I might like owning one. Eventually, the Series 2 came out and you could finally swim with them, and that was what got me to try it out.

It wasn't an instant ""how did I ever live without this"" product for me. It took a while, but eventually it did become something I wouldn't leave the house without. 

The fitness tracking has been a really good motivator for me to work out (who knew I'd care so much about earning virtual badges that do nothing). I wear mine to bed, and it's proven to be a great sleep tracker (I use an app called AutoSleep). The heart rate monitoring is nice to have.

I love being able to get notifications and act on them without taking out my phone. It's so convenient to be able to respond to a text or start a timer or whatever while my hands are busy. I use Siri on it all the time. If I'm using maps for navigation, my watch will tap me and let me know when I need to make turns (it has different patterns to differentiate between left and right turns). 

The watch acts as a remote for the camera, so you can put it on a tripod and use the watch as a remote trigger. The watch will also display the camera viewfinder, so you can, say, point your phone camera behind your TV and look at what it's seeing on your wrist. 

All of these features worked on my Series 2, but Siri was so fucking slow. The watch overall was very slow. I upgraded to a Series 4 and it made a huge difference. There are still some moments where Siri will take a little while to turn my lights on, but overall it's been great and the watch at this point has solidified itself as something I'll continue to use for the foreseeable future."
1465,"It depends on what you do and if you can afford it. I only have a gps series 4 but that doesn‚Äôt matter because i have my phone on me no matter what.

It is very useful when navigating in a city where using a phone can be distracting and cumbersome. You won‚Äôt miss a notification ever or any phone call with it on. Very customizable, and helps get active and is health oriented.

If you can afford it and are in the apple ecosystem then it is pretty good. But just remember that you are pretty much locked in apples system if you get it.

Also get applecare if u get one, won‚Äôt need to worry about a bulky ugly case or screen protectors. Unless you are in environments where it could easily crack on something and get damaged, then i guess a shock proof case will be in order if you don‚Äôt want to use up your 2 accidental damage incidents.

Go to an apple store and check it out if you are serious.

Don‚Äôt get a series 3 though."
1466,"I never use it other than to track my sleep and use Gymaholic for workouts. I wear it every single day. Never go anywhere without it. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it if you are very active, otherwise don‚Äôt bother."
1467,"I got a Series 3 as a gift a few years ago. To me, it‚Äôs just a nice thing to have (for workouts, for notifications, for its sleek look with the Milanese Loop Band). It‚Äôs not an absolute necessity for me. I‚Äôm certainly glad I have it! But would I spend my own money to buy one? Maybe not. And when I‚Äôm not wearing my Apple Watch, I‚Äôm wearing a regular ol‚Äô analog watch"
1468,"Having a smart watch makes life a little more convent. I work with pesticides and instead of having to interrupt  my entire work flow and de-glove to answer a phone call or message I can handle that on the watch with my ""clean hand"" or even my nose in a pinch. The workout tracking helps me monitor how active I am during the day and the whole ""closing your rings"" activity tracking is addictive. I can see how these help people lose weight and remain active. Also, the series 4 and 5 have ekg abilities for those conscious and curious abo8t heart activity. The most important thing as it pertains to safety for me is the fall detection. I work all over the place and if anything happened to me it automatically contacts emergency services. I'd say it's worth it. If you're that curious and don't want to pay full price try a site like swappa for really good deals on new/used watches. I picked up a mint series 4 stainless for well under current model prices. You can even find older models for well under $200."
1469,[deleted]
1470,"You're asking on this sub, so you probably  expect to hear positive things...

I got it to track my swimming workout, and splurged on the LTE version because the ability to take calls without my phone would potentially be helpful. I haven't really used that very much, but it's nice to have.

What I actually wind up using it for is to check the weather and set timers, and I seem to do those multiple times per day and it's very convenient for that. I also get my text notifications on it. All of these save me pulling out my phone. I still  carry my phone, but with a toddler it's nice to be able to do things virtually  hands-free."
1471,I get constant messages from team members at work. Looking at the watch quickly and sending off a one or two response is useful.
1472,Why is gym in all caps
1473,"I don't think it's worth purchasing a brand new one. That being said, I recently got mine (used but great condition) and I really like it so far. I just got it so I could get DeltaTrainer, a workout tracker that analyzes your form and pairs you with a real trainer. So far both have been going great"
1474,If you like wearing a time piece or need a fitness tracker I would get one. I love wearing watches so when it came out I got one as soon as I could. I love it. It keeps me from using my phone when I out with friends. If I get a notification I can just glance at my watch and see what it was rather than pull myself away from everything and get sucked into my phone.
1475,"I got mine as a gift. At the time would I have bought it? No. Now that i'm used to it if it dies would I buy another? Hell yes. 

It's just convenient as hell. Life changing? No. Convenient and a joy to use? Yes. 

If money is really tight though? No"
1476,yes. in my experience it‚Äôs best for notifications and directions from maps
1477,"I‚Äôve been wearing an Apple Watch basically every day for almost 5 years.  I started with a launch model and now have a S4 LTE model. 

I can honestly say that it‚Äôs very nice to have and offers numerous conveniences, but basically nobody needs one.  

I‚Äôm an interesting case in that I don‚Äôt do any formal exercise at all. I do track my steps and make a general attempt to close my ‚Äúrings‚Äù, and the data for steps/calories is definitely more accurate than just the phone. 

It is indeed nice to have notifications on my wrist and recently I‚Äôve been using Apple Pay on my Watch very frequently (almost every day).  

One thing I‚Äôve only begun to use is raise to speak to Siri, and it‚Äôs surprisingly useful not to have to shout ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù  and your can do it when your phone is in your pocket.  

Overall I like my Watch a lot and plan to continue to wear it every day, but it‚Äôs definitely not a necessity."
1478,"I‚Äôm usually in meetings a lot and my Apple Watch helps me check messages and emails when they come in. So for me, it‚Äôs so worth it."
1479,"I had every Apple Watch up to and including series 4. Decided it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted from a watch. Charging it every single day was a hassle, always wondering why my battery life was shit, Siri being unresponsive, AirPods sometimes pairing to phone instead of watch and vise Versa. Ended up getting a Garmin instead. 2 week battery life, heart rate monitor, GPS. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back."
1480,"Love mine, I‚Äôve had a series 2 and now series 4. Fitness tracking is good just with the native app for me. I use mostly native apps tbh. My recommendation for most people is just to buy it, give it one week, if you don‚Äôt like it, take it back. My bet is that you won‚Äôt take it back"
1481,Other then working out part I‚Äôd say no
1482,Yes
1483,"For me, that was a game changer for notifications. Plus, there are tons of little features that I like, such as Shazam in one tap, maps directions, commands when I'm watching a movie, etc"
1484,"I thought it was super gimmicky but I bought one to try making apps for it. I thought I‚Äôd barely use it, and now I feel naked without it."
1485,It doesnt work too well with any Android smartphone I own. :(
1486,"I had an original Apple Watch and honestly disliked it. The battery didn‚Äôt cut it, the apps were basic, but, most of all, I hated how it caused me to look at my watch when a notification came in and distract me from my conversations. I worked at the time with many Apple Watch owners, and it was a constant bad feeling when someone would look at their watch during a conversation, as if they had something better to do.

I know the tech has improved, but I went back to an analog watch, and I love it. No one compliments you for a smart watch, anyway."
1487,"Totally. Bought my series 3 gps only over Christmas, first smart watch (and first watch I've worn in 20 years). I love it. 

I bought my first iPhone in May 2018 and since then I go on a daily walk (weather permitting) while listening to music. In the colder months I wear a pullover so I can place the phone in my pocket but in summer I wear mesh shorts and a t shirt so the phone is too heavy/bulky to put in my pocket so I have to hold it in my hand the entire time which gets old especially on hot humid days. Don't have to worry about sweat or rain with the watch. 

Also tracking is more accurate. For example Im on Weight Watchers and have a certain number of activity points to meet each week. With the iPhone it only counted steps, and only when I had the iPhone on me. I barely beat my weekly goals but I wear my watch all day except showering or sleeping, and Im doubling my activity points in WW now because it tracks so much more. And the built in activity apps are really nice too. 

That said I do wish there was some kind of dashboard on MacOS I could use to track progress over time, right now its just the Activity app on the phone and that's it."
1488,Yes
1489,"It‚Äôs worth it for me. But I acknowledge it‚Äôs a hugely personal thing.

I use mine all the time for adding things to my reminders, my shopping list, seeing my shopping list when I‚Äôm at the grocery store, controlling music that‚Äôs playing in my AirPods, and more.

All of those are things I could do on my phone, yes. But it‚Äôs much more comfortable for me to have it on my wrist, rather than having to reach into my pocket. And around the house, my phone is often on my desk, not directly with me.

I've owned smart watches since 2015, first the Moto 360, and then the Apple Watch."
1490,"I find the AW ugly and never saw the necessity for one, but when I was looking for a fitness tracker, after a thorough cost benefit analysis, I cane to the conclusion, that for my needs, the AW is the cheapest option.
I need my fitness tracker to be able to store my music and with that in mind, we‚Äôre in the price range of the AW. And with the AW I got fitness tracker and smart watch in one.

Note: I had a discount for the AW too."
1491,"If it worked with Android I'd order one in a heartbeat. I love tracking me data, the fitness tracking of iOS is far better than others out there in my opinion.


I also trust iOS's privacy controls more than Android's for the average user."
1492,"Beyond the obvious, I love mine for:

Silent alarm. Waking up to a Taptic feedback on the wrist is cool. 

Pinging my phone. I have ADD and misplace it multiple times a day. 

Running. Watch + AirPods is such a futuristic combo, it‚Äôs incredibly liberating."
1493,"I just love the convenience of it. Seeing exact calories burned is pretty neat. Recording workouts with it. Starting music from it without taking out your phone. Temperature and weather conditions at a glance is great. I‚Äôve gone probably less than 5 days without wearing it since I got my S3 almost two years ago. $200 for a new S3 straight from Apple is a steal, it‚Äôs got everything you‚Äôd need in a smart watch. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it, something I use every day without fail."
1494,"If you have at least two specific uses you want it for yes.

I bought mine (Nike S5 gps) to track my runs and my bouldering sends and to let me keep my phone in my pocket more.

I love it, but I would not have bought it as a gimmick."
1495,"I think the best feature is that it tells time well. 

 I had the same mindset as you before I bought mine and now I love it. Apple Pay is so easy, being able to skip songs easily without picking up my phone, I find myself using the camera app as a viewfinder a lot, and circles become a natural and fun way to keep on top of exercise goals."
1496,The Apple Watch is the true ball and chain of the ecosystem and it‚Äôs absolutely worth it. Apple Pay on the wrist makes for an easy life. Workout competitions with friends get me moving more. Not checking my phone for every single notification.
1497,Honestly apart from looking good (but always anxious about scratching your glass screen) and looking at the time/calories burnt/sleep tracking. I did not in the slightest felt it helped me much. I sold both my s2 and s3 after a few months of using it. It doesn't feel like its a product that one would need at the moment. It isn't yet at its prime i believe. Apple needs to convince us more as to why we should get it.
1498,"It‚Äôs great being able to leave your phone on silent but still know every message/phone all because of a little buzz on your wrist, the same when driving or cycling when using maps, knowing a turn is coming up without having to constantly look at the display of your phone/CarPlay is great. I never wore a watch before the Apple Watch and I‚Äôm 5 years in now."
1499,"For me it‚Äôs the notifications, the calls that I take while driving, the hearth rate monitor... It‚Äôs worth it.

And I know that a lot of people, like me, are a little paranoid and they constantly feel a false sense of  vibration from their phones in the pockets... wearing the watch gets rid of the false feeling. You‚Äôll know when a notification is sent on your wrist."
1500,"I use it so I can go swim for an hour, chill in the hot tub and take calls when I‚Äôm critically required to do so for work. That‚Äôs the only reason I have one, but it‚Äôs a pretty compelling use."
1501,"I didn‚Äôt realise how much I have come to rely on my Apple Watch until I decided to stop wearing it for a few days due to a particularly itchy rash on my wrist. 

It felt weird feeling my iPhone vibrate in my pants pocket but not knowing whether it was an important message or just some notification from a social media app. 

Being a teacher, I had my timetable stored as calendar events, which I could view as part of my daily schedule via the Siri watch face. Without my watch, I was constantly checking my phone for the time to ensure that I wouldn‚Äôt miss my next class. I don‚Äôt understand how some people can claim that their phone has replaced their watch. 

Some other nice conveniences include Apple Pay, Siri on the wrist and some apps such as 1Password and Bear. 

It‚Äôs definitely been a great convenience for me. I don‚Äôt think I can go back to wearing a normal watch ever again."
1502,"I have owned an Apple Watch Series 3 for about two years now.  I absolutely love it.  I wear it almost constantly - only take it off to charge.  I am definitely not a health freak but I do love how the watch motivates me to get off my butt (I work in an office all day).  Closing the rings has become a daily game for me.  I don't have a gym membership but I do like to walk and I have a treadmill & elliptical at the house.  Awesome how the Apple Watch tracks my progress during all these exercises.  One thing I like the best is when walking I am always trying to maintain or break my ""average pace"".

One last thing - if you're not sure then buy yourself a Series 4.  You don't need the latest as it hasn't changed that much.  I bought the Series 3 when the Series 4 came out.  The latest is the series 5 and honestly there's nothing in the 5 that would force me to upgrade from my 3.

Hope this helps."
1503,"Absolutely worth it ! First off, I never used to wear a watch before because I didn‚Äôt see the point, but an Apple Watch is worth being around your wrist.

Exercise tracking is really nice, and having super quick access to music/podcast controls while you do it is even better ! You can also have tons of weather complications on the watchface and quickly know how it is outside without having to get your phone out.

And not getting your phone out is amazing ! I used to get distracted by notifications much more, now I just quickly glance at my wrist and move it just enough to light up the screen, and I can know right away whether it‚Äôs important or not.

It puts a definite end to the cycle of picking up your phone to look at a notification and then going to browse Reddit kinda automatically. Now I only pick up my phone whenever I want to.

I know you said you don‚Äôt want the cellular model, however I would usually advise people to get that one. Being able to leave the house without a phone is extremely useful, especially when you‚Äôre a woman and your clothes don‚Äôt necessarily have pockets. Now I don‚Äôt have to carry a whole entire bag just for my phone, and that‚Äôs a great relief !"
1504,I use the Watch for 95% of all my payments. It‚Äôs so convenient. That alone makes it worth it. Add to that all the other amazing stuff it does.
1505,100% yes
1506,"I paid $150 for my S1 and cannot see myself paying regular price for this thing.    sure it's interesting to get stats on my activity and sleep but it's all just fluff for me, nothing life changing."
1507,It's so useful to not have to pull out my phone to do most of what I want to do now. I am even typing this on my watch right now.
1508,"I stopped wearing my nice watch after getting my first Apple Watch (Series 0) a few years back. Haven't really touched my nice watch for years.

So yes, it was worth it."
1509,"In my opinion it is primarily a health and wellness device. The messages and phone/facetime features are really secondary in terms of actually usefulness. 

If you're into fitness or looking to get in better shape it's a no brainer. If not then I wouldn't recommend one."
1510,"Nah, it's just a really nice fitbit that integrates well with rest of Apple.  I'm not likely to upgrade unless there are compelling health features in the future."
1511,"Bought an S4 when it came out and had buyers remorse when it came to the price. I returned it after a few days and a year later I picked up the S3 on Black Friday for $120.

I‚Äôm much happier with my choice now even though the S3 isn‚Äôt as nice as the S4. I think they‚Äôre cool devices but definitely not necessary and I wouldn‚Äôt pay over $200 for one."
1512,Hell yeah it is. I like it just as a neat digital watch!
1513,"For me it‚Äôs worth it as it works way better than my old Fitbit, you can see a lot of info at a glance, you don‚Äôt have to pull out your phone to use Siri, can change music easily, check notifications, make phone calls, and it can be set up to track irregular heartbeats.   

I‚Äôm trying to get into shape again but my heart isn‚Äôt in the best shape and the other day said my heartbeat was irregular. I checked on my omron blood pressure monitor to verify and my diastolic and systolic numbers were high. I had to take a pill to get them back to normal. If i didn‚Äôt have this watch I‚Äôm not sure i ever would have known and who knows what could have happened. It‚Äôs nowhere near as accurate as a cuff or chest blood pressure monitor, but you can‚Äôt wear those all the time."
1514,Do you exercise enough and want something more? If not then it isn‚Äôt worth it.
1515,.
1516,"Totally. I‚Äôve been using Apple Watch since 2 and now up to 5. If you‚Äôre into fitness, health tracking and overall convenience of getting all the info in your wrist...

There‚Äôs no other smart watch that can hold up to Apple"
1517,"What I‚Äôve experienced is that its difficult to explain why it‚Äôs worth it until you‚Äôve started to use it. For some it‚Äôs a big purchase and I‚Äôve had several friends say, it‚Äôs too much, it can‚Äôt really be that worth while. It isn‚Äôt until they‚Äôve started to use it that they find value in the watch in their own unique way.

Overtime what I find valuable in the watch has changed. From using it for notifications and not having to take my phone out, skipping songs, now to exclusively being a fitness watch and wearing it every day regardless if I workout because I‚Äôve grown accustomed to having it on my wrist every day. If it broke tomorrow, I would go straight to Apple store to fix it. I lost my workout band a few weeks ago. I was scrambling at 8pm to see where I can go to buy a band so I can use it for my workout the next morning.

TLDR; it‚Äôs worth it but it‚Äôs difficult for me to explain why it‚Äôs worth it until you‚Äôve started to use it for awhile."
1518,"I have had mine since December 2017 and let me tell you its one of the best gifts I have ever receved. A few things

1. ability to change songs (spotify) not having to take my phone out. Great when my hands are a little busy. Like the gym or even while in shower
2. reading texts when hands are busy. I get on roofs for work and its great when my boss is texting me. 
3. You do have to charge it every night for me at least. but recently they improved the battery. 
4. I check the temp by just glancing at my wrist (do I need a jacket) I have it set to background with DATE, TIME, CITY, and hi and low temps.
5. With apple pay you press the watch button three times and hold up to machine and it will read it instantly.

There is more but those are ones of the top my head. I love them so much I could sell them to an Amish community."
1519,"i‚Äôm in the ecosystem already, so i‚Äôm bias, but i really love my apple watch. i‚Äôve only had it for about a month or so, but it has def been a plus for me. the biggest thing is that it keeps me off my phone. i like being able to respond to a message from my phone or (most of all) controlling my music, podcasts, & volume from it. also, as someone who isn‚Äôt as active as i would like, the activity tracking does help push me more, whether during a workout or just day to day. i got it for christmas, but i would pay for one if i had to. also i have the GPS version. i didn‚Äôt need the cellular."
1520,"Do you listen to music often in the gym? Bluetooth in your car? I wear mine every day and my nice mechanical watches are gathering dust, so yeah."
1521,"Incredibly worth it if you‚Äôre active; if you have medical insurance through your employer, check and see if they will reimburse the cost of a base model Watch."
1522,"No, it isn't. It's a gimmick, at least for me. Grab yourself a regular watch instead"
1523,"I have the GPS version and LOVE IT!!  As a watch it‚Äôs great to control my home, and fitness device also if I forget my wallet no problem and great to find your iPhone when it‚Äôs slid down the sofa...   the only problem is I don‚Äôt want to wear my Rolex anymore"
1524,I‚Äôve owned 3 of them but this S4 might be my last. I should be more active and I do walk/jog the dogs but I never use the watch correctly for it. I like it for notifications but I still pick up my phone so it just isn‚Äôt worth it for me.
1525,I use a fit bit blaze for all the features you mentioned 200$ the apple watch makes calls and  takes pictures more than I would ever want my watch to do. Blaze also tracks my sleep which is very helpful
1526,I had to go to the chiropractor a bunch until I got this. It‚Äôs paid for itself in cost savings.
1527,"My girlfriend has one, but to be completely honest I see it sitting on the charger much more often than I see her wearing it. She never wears it in the house because she‚Äôs always near her Mac or her phone, but she‚Äôll definitely be wearing when we‚Äôre out and about. If I asked her, she‚Äôd say it was worth it, but I definitely do not want one. In the end it‚Äôs value/use is going to be super subjective."
1528,No battery life sucks so hard and I wish the face was round
1529,"To be honest it‚Äôs hard to say if it will be worth it for you. In my job it helps to see notifications and decide whether pulling my phone out to respond is worth it or not as my phone literally is vibrating every couple of minutes between emails and text messages. It‚Äôs also great during the winter when your phone may be in your coat pocket. 

I don‚Äôt really use any other feature of it except the clock lol

My wife on the other hand had one and hated the fact that she got buzzed on her wrist"
1530,"Quick question, how much storage space does the watch have for me to copy my music to it if I were to use it without the phone and have it act like an MP3 player? That's an awesome feature as I usually put my iPhone in the locker at the Gym to not risk breaking it and I end up listening to the crappy music they play at the gym."
1531,"Allows me to keep my phone in my pocket, complications are super useful and fully customizable, time is dead accurate, control my sound system anywhere in my house, great for the gym and swimming. Oh, and it tells the time.

Long story short, I can‚Äôt go back to a dumb watch."
1532,apple employee here: worth it if you regularly work out
1533,yes
1534,"If you can afford it, it‚Äôs totally worth it. I use it for notifications, fitness tracking, timers, and Apple Pay mostly. If you‚Äôre on the fence, get an older model and see how much you like it.  I also have complications on my watch face so I can see the weather and S&P 500 at a glance."
1535,"Didn't have one working out in the ""old"" pre-smart-device days and I was doing fine without knowing my exact heart rate or calories burned. I have an iPhone 6s and never used these health apps."
1536,Other than for tracking exercising I found it pretty worthless. It still needs a phone to update apps and isn‚Äôt a true stand alone device yet. When it gets there then perhaps it will prove it‚Äôs utility. I don‚Äôt have the latest version so is it there yet? The one I have lives a drawer 95% of the time.
1537,I was never into smart watches either until I got my first one
1538,"If you‚Äôre used to regularly wearing something on your wrist, you‚Äôd probably be really happy with an Apple Watch. But if you don‚Äôt regularly wear something on your wrist due to discomfort/convenience, which was my scenario, you might not think it‚Äôs worth it. 

You have to incorporate wearing the watch everyday into your lifestyle if you want the full benefits of it, as there‚Äôs not much middle ground for casual users to get that much out of it. Personally I think the phone does everything 10x  better than a watch and a phone has no barrier of discomfort."
1539,"I can‚Äôt get used to anything you wear. Tried the watch and it feels like a handcuff to me. Tried AirPods and they felt like ear weights. I guess I‚Äôm just a phone guy. As much as I love tech, I‚Äôm not for wearing it."
1540,"I love mine. I decided in April 2017 to be fit, and getting the watch was an important part of tracking my progress. I count on it so much that one day when I broke mine I called in to work to say I'd be late and went right to the Apple store to buy another one.

I'm sure there are other options but I do like the Apple watch and I like how it works with my other Apple products, for example managing my playlist while I run.

I use it for other incidentals, but mostly fitness tracking, and using it as my alarm clock because it wakes me without troubling my spouse."
1541,"Worth it in the same way an iPad is worth it. Not necessary, but a huge convenience. Everyone finds something different about it that is personally useful to them. For me:

* Notifications while driving is good for glancing. Let's you see if a text message is something dumb or something you need to respond to.
* If you use a timer often, the timer complication is awesome. Complications in general are great.
* There's a calculator app now which includes a [handy tip button](https://i1.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/07/how-to-use-split-bill-tip-calculator-apple-watch-watchos-6.jpeg?w=1500&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1)
* Good activity/workout monitor as mentioned
* There's a button in the control center that will play a sound on your phone if you can't find it"
1542,"I check my watch a lot because I'm careful time manager.  


The result of getting the watch was that I check it exactly the same amount, but now I never have to check my phone because I'll see the little red dot on the watch (which indicates notifications).  


 Other features are just icing."
1543,"I use mine constantly. My hands are often in gloves or greasy, so it‚Äôs a life saver when I get a bunch of texts, calls, etc. I went nearly a year without one after my Series 0 died, really missed having it. But as the top comment says: I wouldn‚Äôt put myself in the red to have one."
1544,"I‚Äôve had an Apple Watch since the very first one was released. Initially I thought it was a gimmick but it has so many uses. Here‚Äôs just a few you may enjoy (restrictions may apply) 

Apple Pay tap and go at the supermarket. 
Go for a run (leave your phone at home) and stream music or podcasts to your Bluetooth headphones/AirPods. 
Raise watch to talk to Siri 
Turn by turn haptic feedback for navigation so you don‚Äôt look at your phone while driving. 

Swim workouts. Cycle workouts. HIIT. Hiking. You name it there‚Äôs a workout for you to do. 
Discreet messages/notifications without glancing at your phone 
Quickly reply to messages by scrolling down to default replies 

Other features 
Daily activity reminders, stand reminders, breathe app, walkie talkie (talk to someone else with an Apple Watch), noise meter (warns you when environment is too loud), fall detection, iPhone camera remote

Great apps like 
AutoSleep app (costs $) to track your sleep habits. 
Track menstrual cycle"
1545,"I bought a series one, had it till the series 4 came out and upgraded.. Not Cellular for both... use it for responding to messages with voice and music changes throughout the day, calculator app is handy, glancing at stills from camera alerts at the house, weather data checks, reminders/notifications, translation app came in handy a few times, SoundHound as it‚Äôs quicker to identify a song without pulling out my phone, all of my wallet purchases at Starbucks and the workplace food market, and the gas stations with the tap to pay, as well as lots of other few time apps uses.. I found it to be essential in my life now and can‚Äôt imagine wearing any of my regular watches from my collection, Aside from the pocket watches on the special occasions (but still wear the AW4 as well lol)  my wife is in the same spot, however she also has a workout routine which she also tracks data with her watch4 also.  Gets plenty of use.  I was worried I was going to damage it at work, so I was wearing a snap on screen cap over my series 1 at work as a carpenter/heavy vehicle parts handler for awhile before I realized the cheap plastic screen protector wasn‚Äôt taking any damage or scuffs so I stopped worrying about that, every time I smack it or rub it on anything I expect a scuff but never anything.  It‚Äôs extremely handy to not pull my phone out at work, as leadership can Hawkeye ya with a phone... worth every penny."
1546,Absolutely
1547,"I really like the fitness stuff.  Other than that, it's a neat gadget.   It doesn't do anything life changing for me, but I like it.  I like notifications for things that I don't get a lot of notifications from, but I turned them off for things like facebook  messenger where the notifications were annoying."
1548,It‚Äôs freaking amazing. Best thing I ever did for my health.
1549,"I like it a lot, but I also really like watches. If you don‚Äôt like wearing a watch, the AW won‚Äôt change that. It‚Äôs cool being able to check the weather without pulling out my phone and opening an app, but the killer feature for me is Apple Pay. I feel like I‚Äôm in Blade Runner or something when I just hold my wrist up to the terminal to pay for groceries."
1550,"**Stuff I Love**

* I can put podcasts or music right in the watch, so I don't need to carry my phone with me for a workout.
* I can respond to or send texts via dictation.
* I can place calls from my phone and leave my phone in my bag.
* The alarm wakes me up without excessive noise. You get a brighter display leading up, shaking on your wrist, and a nice, quiet alarm. Wakes me up without waking up my wife.
* I get reminders to stand, to breathe, to get active, all of which I need.
* I can track my heart rate and thus monitor my stress level.
* I track my rowing workouts with a great rowing app (Rowing Coach)
* Apple Pay is a lot easier with the watch than it is with the phone.
* Calculator, weather, calendar, reminders and maps on my wrist? Awesome.

**Stuff I Don't Love**

* It's tied to the iPhone for many of its services, for updates, for apps, etc. For a guy that wants his phone gone, this isn't good.
* Battery life is just OK. I feel like I have to put it on the charger every night, so I can't use it as a sleep monitor.
* The cellular version doesn't stream Apple Music directly without an iPhone, and you have to still load it up with music when it's on the charger and sync it with your phone if you want to go truly sans phone."
1551,"It's helped me become a healthier person.  I never exercised when I was younger and now I'm running 4 miles 3x a week. Being able to compete with friends and seeing their notifications when they complete a workout, motivates me and I'm sure I do the same to them."
1552,"Just as a side note, calorie counting mechanisms are not very accurate for various reasons."
1553,"It boils down to three things for me

1. As you mentioned, fitness tracking is great. Especially when you can bring your music with you without the phone. Even without the cell connection, you can store a reasonably sized playlist on the watch
2. Wallet. I never really used Apple Pay that much in brick & mortar stores before getting an Apple Watch. For me, pulling out my phone is as much 'work' as my physical wallet. But with my Apple Watch, it's already out and just requires a double press. In the NYC subway, I don't even need to press (if I change the setting) to simply pay for my subway ride by passing by. And though it's superfluous, getting on a plane by scanning your watch is baller.
3. Siri/Message responses. Because the way you use Siri on the watch means you bring the equipment closer to your mouth, it seems to be better at parsing what you're saying. I mostly use it to respond to messages or set reminders, but it really makes me appreciate Siri a ton more. I also use it to verbally turn on lights. It really boils down to Siri understanding me better and therefore being more useful

Generally, I would say none of this is necessary, but once you have it, it's a sweet device that becomes very annoying to live without. There are definitely other features I use and care about (eg, the ability to see my cal, the time, and the temp at a glance), but they aren't game changers for me like the above. It really makes the ecosystem shine. Hope this helps"
1554,The Apple Watch is one of the worst for sports because it has the shortest battery life of any sports watch.
1555,Can't ever use a dumb watch again.
1556,Yes
1557,"i shit on apple a lot, but i really do like the watch. the only reason i sold mine is because when i get sweaty at work i hate the way the watch feels on my wrist. i know thats a dumb ass sounding thing to say, but i never could find a band that fit my wrist and felt comfy no matter what."
1558,"I find it one of the nicest, most impressive bits of Apple tech, but not ‚Äòessential‚Äô.

If you consider it like an iPhone ‚Äònano‚Äô with shitty battery life it‚Äôs fantastic. iMessage voice to text is incredible, Apple Pay, run tracking whilst listening to podcasts, etc... I can often just leave phone at home if not out all day."
1559,"I am really grateful for every reply you guys have posted here. This is what I was looking for, not the usual over hyped reviews on YouTube but real world usage scenarios, annoyances (ie. charging it daily), etc.

This forum is great!!"
1560,Mine just sort of irritates me. I bought it two years ago and it was OK for about six months but since then it‚Äôs just gotten gradually slower to the point of frustration. I use it only for tracking my runs and checking the time now and use my iPhone for everything else because it‚Äôs much faster.
1561,Yup I love mine. Had a S2 that I gave to my sister when I upgraded to a S4 bc I wanted a bigger screen. My favorite app on the watch that I say is a game changer from any Samsung Gear/Fitbit is the Apple Maps integration. Turn by turn direction with Taptic reminders on which direction to turn is great. Nothing else can match that that I‚Äôve seen so far and it‚Äôs a perfect feature to never get lost or make a wrong turn/miss an exit.
1562,"Well, I'm now on my third one.

I've never felt the *need* to upgrade, but I feel that every 2-3 years, the watch has progressed to the point where it's justified.

I've found it to be an essential tool in my workout program. I also enjoy the notifications and other tidbits of information it provides me.

Nothing - or at least, very little - is *essential,* and I could live without it just like I could live without my many other Apple products, but I can't deny that having it simplifies my life and increases convenience and productivity."
1563,"Its nice to have but not necessary. Use it for music, notifications, and messaging."
1564,Eh. It‚Äôs a toy not a tool. If you have extra money go for it. I wear mine every day and it‚Äôs just a  notification mule
1565,Hell no it isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs Apple
1566,Weird question but are the series 5 Nike bands different than the series 2 Nike bands?  I recently upgraded and the new band feels thicker and more rigid. Wondering if it‚Äôs just cuz it‚Äôs new.
1567,[deleted]
1568,"For years I dreamed of buying a luxury watch, but couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around the cost. I waited as long as the release of the Series 2 to buy the Apple Watch, and never regretted it. I‚Äôve only ever bought the one and it‚Äôs still ticking. I will confess to being fully imbedded into the Apple ecosystem, and has done as advertised by way of becoming part of daily life.

Long lasting, aesthetically gorgeous, and easily integrated with other Apple products under your direct control. That is what‚Äôll make it worth it. A product to have just to have, maybe not so much."
1569,"Do you think you‚Äôd use all the features it provides? If fitness tracking is what you desire you can get a device that will do that well for less money. 

Every time I consider a Watch I wonder to myself whether I *really* need or want faster access to notifications etc. I could probably stand to be less connected to my phone, not more. 

Also perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I more often than not find that people with an Apple Watch make a lot of professional faux pas in meetings and the like. I consider every time someone opposite me has (rudely) looked at their watch for some useless notification and realize I don‚Äôt want to be that person. 

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
1570,"I started out by just wearing my watch during workouts, then runs and hikes outdoors. Now I leave my iPhone at home EVERYDAY and just wear my watch.

Total Freedom.

So yeah I'd say it's worth it. And then some. Admittedly I'd say I wouldn't use it or want to use it without LTE service."
1571,My watch (4) best thing i ever bought. Worth every penny. Leaving phone at home is fab.
1572,"I have one and now I wouldn't be without one. Having said that it's not essential, it's just really convenient. Key things I like

\- I can use it to find out where I left my phone !

\- it automatically unlocks my laptop

\- easily see and silence incoming calls

\- fitness reminders help me be a little more active

\- a watch app works with my two factor auth at work making that convenient

\- easy access to alarms and timers

\- see new texts (although its not great for sending them)

\- directions on the watch when walking

\- music and podcast controls on the watch

Also some very nice watch faces with weather info and appointment reminders."
1573,"Oddly enough, I purchased my first Watch (gen 3) when I put the order in for my 12"" iPad. It was like, I was already dropping almost 2 grand, and I was curious about it. Figured if I hated it, I'll send it back.

3 years on I'm on the same iPad which is at best, a convenience use when my laptop is not practical, and my Watch has never left my wrist. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed using it. Always-on access to Siri, important Notifications at my wrist, always handy for timers, weather, etc. and the fitness stuff has been a surprising help in getting my ass to move during the day. I feel like a bit of a chump for saying this, but the gamifying exercise? That absolutely works. I used to hate doing anything other than games and such, but you better believe I'll do some quick stairs or tidy the house for a bit to fill my rings.

I'm a convert. Currently on my second Watch with no plans to not have one going forwards."
1574,"I've always been a ""watch"" guy, so I like wearing watches. I had the first Apple Watch and thought it was okay, but it was slow and I didn't find the functionality too compelling. Fast forward to my S5, and I think it is an amazing device. I don't think I could live without it, especially the fitness tracking and the ability not to be tethered to my iPhone."
1575,"It's the best piece of tech I own, including my pride and joy gaming pc, and I own a lot of tech.

A lot."
1576,"I absolutely hate the fact that battery replacements out of warranty are prohibitively expensive. 
I got a cheap Garmin Forerunner just for GPS and heart-rate tracking. I can‚Äôt replace the battery there either, but at least it‚Äôs only 80 bucks instead of 300.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying 80 bucks every three years - but not over 200. That‚Äôs insane."
1577,"As owner I wouldn't recommend it. After initial good impressions, at the end of the day the only feature that's gamechanging for me is paying with watch. Other stuff is very usual - notifications, checking weather and setting up timer.

For the activity tracking, it's mostly annoying and builds up a dark pattern of feeling really bad if you've build 60 day streak and then went to a party and slept a lot, you couldn't do the 12 hours on feet chalenge. Also annoying when the app tells you to ""start"" trakcing walking - this isn't something you want to do, should be seamless - maybe it is if u turn it off but the app doesnt tell you that.

But the worst part is that it doesnt look good."
1578,"Ehhhhhh, I guess my answer is: not yet.

I had the money to buy a Series 5 in September and, to be honest, it just didn't meet my great expectations.

The Workout/Activity apps are useful, and they do motivate me to be a little more active, but it's not a game changer for me.  I don't count steps or calories anyway.

The heart rate function is cool but not amazing.  Same thing with the Compass.  The currency converter app was useful when I went on a vacation last month, through a bunch of countries that used different currencies.  And of course it's just convenient to have a beautiful looking timepiece that I use many times through the day.

The music app is great and important.  I haven't used the Voice Memos app yet, but I'm sure it will eventually come in handy for secretly recording a sensitive conversation.  I use the timer app every day, since I'm a teacher, and that makes organziing activities and everything easier.

It's kinda annoying to charge it every day, and it just didn't bring me much joy in my life, even though I'm up to my neck in the Apple ecosystem.  But suppose my watch broke, and somehow I was offered the chance to rent an Apple Watch every day.  How much would I pay every day to use my Apple Watch?  Probably not even $1 per day."
1579,"I think it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôve used min everyday to record my workouts and I like being able to check the weather and read a text without having to take my phone out of my pocket. Also since I work in a lab it‚Äôs been great for setting timers.

PS Be wary of the accuracy of calories burned. I‚Äôd say the Apple Watch is precise as I burn the same amount of calories at consistent intensity but I think an algorithm cannot accurately reflect how many calories you actually burn. It‚Äôs better than nothing though so I like to use the term ‚Äúwatch calories‚Äù when I talk about how many calories I burned."
1580,Yes. A million times yes.
1581,100%
1582,"Probably not. If you have to ask, definitely not. End of story, turn the page."
1583,"It‚Äôs the best alarm clock I‚Äôve ever had.

Edit: downvoted? not disparaging the Apple Watch. I wear it to bed, and the Taptic Engine wakes me up better than loud alarm noises ever did."
1584,Yes.
1585,"No, not really, apple pay is cool but that‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs a very bulky watch also"
1586,It‚Äôs helpful when I want to know the time
1587,"Commenting to a 2 year old post may be deprecated, but I might as well pile on:

Yes, my Apple watch(es) have been worth it. I currently have two, a Watch3 and a Watch4.

But: while they are good enough for fitness tracking, they are not best fitness tracking devices. But they do one heck of a lot more than simple fitness tracking.

They are good enough for fitness tracking. However, I have used a whole slew of other fitness trackers and smart watches, and frankly the Apple watch is not as good as the Fitbit watches for fitness tracking. E.g. my Fitbit watches did a much better job of automatically detecting when I am bicycling or hiking. Until the recent WatchOS 8.? updates I pretty much never used Apples workouts because auto detect just plain did not work. Recently that has gotten better. Having to put my Apple Watch into water mode is very annoying - even my old Pebble Classic did not require that. Worse, from my point of view, none of the wrist worn fitness trackers, neither the Apple Watch nor the Fitbit devices, track steps when I am working while walking slowly on a treadmill desk. But with the Fitbit I could wear them on my ankles, and count steps that way. Doesn't work for my Apple Watches. I wish that Apple sold a foot pod, or allowed some other company's foot pod, eg Garmin's, to provide step counts to Apple Health at fine grain (and not just 8,000 steps at 5pm).

BTW, the nice thing about having two watches, keeping the old one when you upgrade, is that you can always have one on your wrist while the other is charging. This somewhat makes up for the Apple Watch is slow charging. I distinctly remember, back when 1 of my friends had an Apple Watch and I have my Fitbit, how surprised he was that my Fitbit charged while I was in the shower, and of course could skip several days without being charged up.

However, the other functionality of an Apple Watch overcomes its deficits as a fitness tracker:

E.g. I dictate nearly all of my text messages into my Apple Watch: ""Hey Siri, text Jim ...""

E.g. I manage grocery lists and reminders on my Apple watch, e.g. ""Hey Siri, add cauliflower to my grocery list"". ""Hey Siri, add meeting at 4pm today with Jim""

E.g. I take many of my voice phone calls on my watch.

E.g. I rely on my Apple Watch to buzz my wrist when I need to get meeting. note that the calendars are actually on my watch, and these things work even when my iPhone is powered off or not present. Last I checked Fitbit calendar reminders were not actually stored on the Fitbit devices, but actually came from your phone, and were just using the buzzer on the Fitbit.

BTW back when I only had a phone, I was driven crazy by alerts and notifications and alarms, which had to be loud enough for me to hear them even when the phone was in the pocket of my jacket hung up in my office cube. I find them much less annoying as haptic vibrations on my watch.

E.g. I am taking more and more notes, recording more and more ideas, using voice on my watch, and relying on speech-to-text to put it into a form that I can manipulate on my phone or my PC. Much improvement is needed, there is no single best app AFAIK, but it works, and it helps.

You might notice a pattern here: the things that I find most useful in my Apple Watch are done by voice, not by poking my big fat fingers at the teensy little text from the screen. Sure, I can look at things on the screen, but I often find myself in a hybrid, using voice on my watch to do as much as possible, but looking at things like longer documents and webpages on my iPhone.

More and more I leave my iPhone behind, e.g. when I go for walk in the woods or buy groceries.

If we ever get a smart glasses display linked to the watch, I could throw the phone away."
1588,"It's an impressive piece of technology, BUT it's a step backwards. Currently  dumb watches don't require charging. The trade of being some checking texts, calories counting, heartbeat tracking. Watches don't offer anything new, Except another thing you need to charge at night/ worry about dying.  


The slight conveniences and athelte specific feature are not enough to justify another device. You would never google search or watch youtube on it,  
Again it's super cool but the charging is the killer for me. At most an ideal watch would require charging once a week."
1589,"The embarrassing battery life of Apple Watch will never make me consider it. I am surprised to read how many people see Apple Watch as a game changer because it counts steps, measures your heartbeat and tracks your workout. So many other products were doing it already before it and much better. 
I own a fitness tracker - light and with 8 days battery. I personally don‚Äôt see the reason for smart watches as a product category to exist (my iPhone is great as it is) and I won‚Äôt ever consider Apple Watch until it matches Fitbit‚Äôs sleep tracking quality and battery life and Garmin‚Äôs fitness tracking accuracy."
1590,"What app do you use for sleep tracking? As I understand it, that's not a native feature as of right now"
1591,"This is a great way to put it. If you can afford it, absolutely get one as it works really well in the ecosystem. If you can't, it is not that needed as it is just an extension to your phone. Calorie counts and steps can be done from any fitness band for much cheaper.

EDIT: Although if someone did want to save money and still wanted a fitness band that uses an iPhone, I would suggest the series 3."
1592,"I‚Äôve considered getting one, but I like mechanical watches too much to wear an Apple Watch instead."
1593,">	I don‚Äôt really use it actively. I use it as a passive activity tracker, weather checker, timer setter, and sleep tracker. Also notifications,

Isn‚Äôt this like, literally the marketed use-case? It‚Äôs not meant to be used actively."
1594,"Exactly this, not a must-have like a phone.

But I can afford it and it makes my day better. so yea"
1595,"Is there a way to opt out of notifications for messages? I hate receiving messages or being reminded of things I can do on my phone. If nothing else, I would just use it for the time, the Internet, and using Spotify. Messaging gives me anxiety sometimes lmfao."
1596,"Why get a smartwatch if you use it passively, as you say? A fitness tracker from other brand are lighter, last you a week and benefit from third-party apps to continuously feed its data to Apple Health if you so desire (on top of the trackers already working great with your iPhone)"
1597,"This.
Bringing your music with you while doing so.
And especially tracking all your workouts and trying to beat your personal records. I‚Äôm reviewing my workouts when I am in bed to learn new things.

Best investment I made in a long time!"
1598,I have one. How do I do this? Do I need WiFi or cell data plan?
1599,which app do you use?
1600,Ended up straight up selling my S5 because Spotify didn‚Äôt have offline support and I cba with Music
1601,how do you check instagram and dick around while others wait for you to finish at the squat rack?
1602,does the GPS only model work well without bringing your phone with you for a run? can I still use apple music and run tracking apps on the go without any connection?
1603,What game?
1604,"This is so true. Unlike the AirPods (which I consider similar to the Apple Watch in so far as you don't NEED it), it's hard to say that you use this product everyday. I usually like to explain that I actively notice when I'm not wearing it, and wish that I was wearing it."
1605,"This. I hate my Apple Watch b/c it's another item I would replace instantly if it's lost or broken ;) 

I didn't wear a watch prior, and got a Series 2 on sale one day to check it out. I have a series 4 now and only take it off to charge. I use it for fitness tracking, alerts, and quick info. Good thing about the watch is I don't feel the need to get each new version. Every other version seems like a good cadence."
1606,"As much as a hate to admit it, you‚Äôre totally right. Anytime I don‚Äôt fill the rings the watch never ceases to remind me that I‚Äôm not quite where I should be lol"
1607,This is the biggest thing I‚Äôve noticed too. Nice explanation.
1608,">	Worn one every day since S0.

I‚Äôve never thought of it like that before but yeah, since the first day the Apple Watch was in the hands of the public, I‚Äôve had one on my wrist!"
1609,This is isn't an arguement specifically for an Apple Watch. Most smart watches provide the functionality you just described.
1610,"> this would give you some good health stats, especially the Garmins

Not health stats, but sports stats. My Garmin Fenix 3 HR is 4 years old and yet I don't see any non-Garmin watch that could surpass it.

So yeah, if you're serious about sports, Garmin is the only way. There were some news article of a guy who ran a marathon with Apple Watch, but the sole fact that this is an article-worthy thing should tell you a lot."
1611,I always have my phone on silent now as the tapping the watch does on your wrist will make you never miss anything.
1612,The AW S4 has the speed the S3 should have had
1613,"Siri on my S3, I feel you.  Even when my phone is right the eff next to my watch, watch siri can't get her shit together enough to answer my question."
1614,"Beyond AutoSleep, I haven‚Äôt found a single 3rd party app worth a damn."
1615,"I'm the exact same way, not bringing my phone is amazing, and the rings really motivate me."
1616,"in your opinion, would it be worth getting the GPS only version?

Edit: GPS *only* version"
1617,That is so tempting man!! :)
1618,You sold me with the flight of stairs comment
1619,Can confirm with my S3
1620,f91w is absolutely based. apple watch is just unnecessary bugman tech.
1621,"Considering how many units Apple has sold, I‚Äôm pretty sure the price is just fine."
1622,"I honestly wonder if Apple doesn‚Äôt understand its prices. Maybe in the Bay Area, $400 is what you spend on bagels and coffee in a week. In the Midwest, that‚Äôs real money."
1623,"Yeah the estimated bill of materials is like 1/4 of the retail price (at least for the original model). There's some cool functionality for techies, but it's an unneeded luxury for most people (I'm still using a Series 1 that I bought when the Series 2 came out)"
1624,"Yes, it‚Äôs the alarms/reminders for me too. I know all I have to do is set them up and I can be confident of getting the right reminder at the right time as I‚Äôll always have my watch on. Gets it all out of my head."
1625,Same.
1626,"I agree, but I am thankful to know that the majority seem to be happy with it and your replies have made me aware of features I never knew you could do like leaving the phone at home and using the watch only to take calls or make payments via Apple Pay"
1627,"I had S0, S3 and now S5. There is no comparison. 5 is crazy fast and stable compared to the older ones."
1628,How‚Äôs the battery in yours? In the last two months my S2 battery has gone to complete shit. That‚Äôs even after repairing as well
1629,man the more I read about what you guys can do with the watch the more tempting it's getting to get one. Controlling the camera shutter with the watch is priceless!
1630,"Thank you so much for your insight. You see, this is what I am afraid of, that after the honey moon I might just set it aside. I do have a Tissot Watch which is very elegant which is why I am thinking twice before making the jump on to the Apple Watch as I am not in a good financial position now after having had bought my iPhone 11 Pro and MacBook Pro 16 if you know what I mean."
1631,You're making me change my mind and jump onto the cell version instead of the GPS version. That sounds dope that you can leave your phone at home and still be able to receive calls and whatnot
1632,"my bad, lemme fix that"
1633,"Now that I read all the comments here, I only want the cellular version which means I can leave my phone at home and head to the gym with nothing in my pocket and be able to pay for stuff and listen to music! That's amazing.

Also, you touched on a great point where you mentioned the convenience of not having to pick up your phone every time to check a notification. You see, while I am doing cardio and listening to Audible with my phone in my pocket, if I get a notification I have to stop and take out the phone to see what's the notification then put it back. I can imagine simply checking the watch will save me a lot of that hassle."
1634,ill take it!
1635,How has it cut down on your visits to the chiropractor?
1636,What model do you have and how often do you charge it?
1637,"About 4GB for the series 3, I think they have slightly more now"
1638,"If you get the cellular version and have Apple Music you can stream all of your music without the phone. Or as long as you're within bluetooth range it'll stream directly from your phone I think. I current have the cell version so I don't remember what the storage is but when I had the standard Series 0 it had plenty of space for a pretty long playlist on it (I never filled it up). 

I love it (paired with AirPods or other wireless headphones) for exercising without the phone. Also (I've had one since late 2015), the most other uses I've got out of it is setting quick timers, notifications, and a much more reliable siri(at least in my experience) compared to the phone."
1639,Never got into wearing normal watches.  Got a S0 and suddenly can‚Äôt leave the house without it.
1640,Probably not possible on r/apple
1641,So having the cellular version allows you to put your SIM card in it and basically it acts like a phone so you don't need your phone?
1642,"best post! Tells the whole story :D

That's it, I'm gonna save up and get the Cellular + GPS version."
1643,[deleted]
1644,"I understand. But as you said, it's better to have a rough estimate than to be in the dark."
1645,"I‚Äôd recommend AutoSleep. Nothing to remember, you just put on your watch when going to sleep."
1646,I stopped tracking sleep when I realized it only made me less confident on days it showed I had less sleep. There was nothing I could do about it so I quit.
1647,"There‚Äôs pillow and sleep++ 
Both are third party and you have to pay for some features but I use the basic version for both and it‚Äôs cool tracking how much you slept"
1648,"I use AutoSleep because I don‚Äôt have to think about it, I just have to wear the watch to bed and that‚Äôs it."
1649,There is a built in sleep tracker but you can share the data with dozens of different apps which have more features. I just use the built in one to see how many hours I got.
1650,"I got a series 3 for Christmas and I love this thing. It‚Äôs helped me get my sleep back on track and it yells at me enough to get my ass up and moving that I‚Äôm noticeably slimming down. It‚Äôs stupid that a little spinning thing in a watch screen helps, but it does."
1651,"The old ones are dirt cheap, series 3 and are totally fine. I get a full day of battery with them and they are functionally totally useful. 


I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd recommend the current gen to anyone as long as much better deals are floating around.  This may change if new models get 4 day battery life or sleep tracking or some kind of killer app."
1652,"Sure, you can control notifications for every app https://i.imgur.com/MTrXODN.jpg"
1653,"I‚Äôll grant you on battery but:

-	I don‚Äôt need it to be cheaper
-	I didn‚Äôt say I **only** use it as a tracker - I use some of the features like timers and music which are easier to use on a full blown smartwatch
-	I don‚Äôt need it to be lighter, I don‚Äôt notice the Watch is on my wrist most of the time"
1654,One or the other + Apple Music.
1655,"Not OP, but Strong, Spotify (or Apple Music if I want to leave my phone), Audible, and Pocket Casts."
1656,Gymaholic for me. Love it.
1657,"I use Delta Trainer, all the normal tracking + it tells you when you have bad form and you get a personal trainer too. I def need the accountability haha"
1658,[deleted]
1659,Yes
1660,"Nah if my AirPods broke I‚Äôm automatically buying more and collecting them the same day. going back to wires sucks more than not having a smart watch imo. All the watch does is be a small phone on my wrist, albeit very well."
1661,Rings are my life now
1662,"They all do stand nagging, badges as well as the body battery etc so casual health stats as well as sports stats.
You‚Äôre right about marathons though - I do the odd ultra (walking) and have a separate watch to record this which has a very long battery life. It‚Äôs one less fuss to worry about when you‚Äôre getting tired after 20 odd hours and wondering whether it‚Äôll die on you.
That does remind me though - I‚Äôm old school and have worn a watch for 40 years. I have small wrists and the fenix 1 I had used to hurt no end. The Apple watches (on my third now, from s0) have been the most comfortable I‚Äôve ever worn."
1663,They say this every year. The truth is Apple massively slows every model down with updates. S2 for example was lightning fast at launch and is now a piece of junk. Same thing is kind of happening to S4.
1664,Authy 2FA for me. Absolute killer app.
1665,"Absolutely. 

The cellular one means you‚Äôre paying additional $ each month for likely very little gain (unless you would leave your phone behind quite often)."
1666,"I think you mean cellular, all models have GPS"
1667,People who want to believe x will always be able to find adequate evidence for x to be a reasonable position. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1668,This is so out of touch and ignorant.
1669,"At the same time, $400 (or $200 for the budget/older model) for a device you use daily, lasts 3+ years, and is half the price of a phone isn't terrible. It's not cheap, but compared to other tech products it's certainly not expensive."
1670,If you‚Äôre seriously comparing raw material cost with retail prices you should brush up on some basic economics.
1671,"Well, I mean, my point‚Äôs not that they make a profit or anything like that. I think of it in terms of utility. If they couldn‚Äôt make it for a cent less, it wouldn‚Äôt change my position: I get about two hundred bucks‚Äô worth of utility out of it. I don‚Äôt get four hundred bucks‚Äô worth of utility out of it. How much they make on each unit isn‚Äôt my concern."
1672,"Absolutely brilliant. Using it for workouts every day & by the time I‚Äôm home in the evening, I‚Äôve still got 40% left. 

It really is the best item I‚Äôve ever purchased & it‚Äôs so good I don‚Äôt feel the need to upgrade."
1673,And the nice thing is that it's available for other camera apps to use as well.
1674,"I have a cellular S3, and I can confirm it is nice to be able to leave my phone at home, or because my 6s+ battery was crap, I could leave my phone in my truck to charge while out and about, and still be able to stay connected. I upgraded to the 11PM, so I don't have to worry about phone battery life anymore lol"
1675,"If I still ran or biked that would be a huge win. I don't do either of those so it's more so I don't have to carry my phone around the house or on a walk around the neighborhood, or can leave it in my locker at the gym. It does cost like $10/month through Verizon for that extra  feature, though, so that may factor into your decision."
1676,"Yeah the cellular model is amazing ! I forgot to mention the music stuff ! Also I love that every cashier I interact with looks at me like I‚Äôm a wizard, paying with my hand and all xD 

Yep, when I go running I can just quickly look at it and only stop for important stuff ! It‚Äôs so convenient"
1677,"It gave me a bunch of stand notifications. I had a pinched nerve in my butt from driving too much, and the sessions were working, but the pain would still come back. I got my Apple Watch halfway through (just cause), and then the sessions worked even better to the point of not needing to go anymore. I guess it turns out my sedentary job‚Äôs sitting was hurting me more then I realized."
1678,I never garage it
1679,more than enough to put my favorite songs. Thanks for clarifying that.
1680,So if I get the GPS version only it can stream music from the Spotify on my iPhone directly where I an keep the iPhone a few feet away from me while I workout?
1681,"It has an e-SIM, so it basically forwards all calls and texts to the watch. Correct, it'll work on its own even if the iPhone is powered off (Calls and iMessages only and any apps that work completely independently; SMS messages do NOT work with the phone powered off or not on wifi and nearby). With the iPhone powered on and connected to wiFi, you can leave the phone at home and EVERYTHING will mirror to the watch, regardless of where you are with your watch.

So every day I leave my iPhone at home, powered on and connected to WiFi. So I get all notifications on my watch, and in some cases, I can even reply to messages (Signal, Microsoft Teams to name a couple) via voice dictation even though neither have Apple Watch apps."
1682,Ok. We‚Äôll see when my Forerunner‚Äòs battery is dead.
1683,"Yes, definitely. Especially since it‚Äôs precise."
1684,Then when do you charge it?
1685,I second that! Been using auto sleep for a week and it‚Äôs the best hands down!
1686,"The funny thing is while I get your POV, I love it for that clarity.

There are 4 possibilities:

\- I feel great and slept well - Case closed. Good, productive day ahead.

\- I feel meh but slept well - ‚ÄúSuck it up, you‚Äôre fine‚Äù

\- I feel great but slept meh - N/A. When does this happen??

\- I feel meh and slept meh. ‚ÄùOk, my feeling is validated by data. That sucks, and FitBit agrees it sucks. Gonna get some great sleep when in get in bed tonight. So excited! Treat yourself, and move on. ‚Äú"
1687,"They‚Äôve done studies where subjects all slept the same certain amount of time, but they changed the clocks to make some of them think they slept less than they actually did. Just that difference of information impaired their performance that day (because they thought they slept less).  Or it was reversed, not entirely sure (don‚Äôt quote me). But there is credibility to what you‚Äôre saying!

Happy cake day!"
1688,Keep in mind it‚Äôs not even a accurate sleep tracker. It has zero way of knowing how long you spend in each sleep stage. It uses movement and potentially heart rate to guesstimate your sleep quality. Doesn‚Äôt have an SP02 sensor either.
1689,"I‚Äòve tracked my sleep for awhile but I‚Äôve just started using the iOS Bedtime feature. I had a sleep study done which showed I woke up a lot throughout the night, which Autosleep never caught, so I might as well just track ‚Äútime in bed‚Äù"
1690,"There is not a built-in sleep tracker, you might be thinking of the bedtime function on the iPhone."
1691,"How do you activate it?

Edit: Found this https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208655"
1692,Definitely agree.
1693,It doesn't on an Apple watch
1694,"I‚Äôd definitely replace my wireless buds or headphones if that happened, but Airpods are similar to other mid to high end True wireless options on the market.  There doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything close to an Apple watch in terms of wearable app integration across so many categories, but headphones just pair, play audio, have a mic, and activate voice assistant, all with some touch or button controls- only the seemless pairing is proprietary to Airpods as a standout feature iirc."
1695,"Cool? If my watch broke I‚Äôd do the same, it was more so just that the Apple Watch is hard to explain to people why they should get it."
1696,Hello Frodo.
1697,"The rings were my life, then I started having some issues closing them, and a bug broke my streak, and I stopped caring.  

I should get back into closing rings."
1698,"probably only for runs, what about then? would the GPS only version be worth it?"
1699,i meant GPS only version
1700,"You spouted a completely arbitrary claim (Apple Watch is 50% overpriced). You're the one who should be providing some evidence to back that up, otherwise I'm sticking to my stance which is that your comment is utter nonsense. If the Apple Watch was truly FIFTY PERCENT overpriced, they wouldn't be flying off the shelves and Apple would be forced to drop the price in order to move them. Middle school economics."
1701,"$200 is a good price and provides good value for money. $400 for a device that lasts only ~3 years is too much, for me."
1702,"Yeah I get what you're saying, but on that same note, their level of profit margin directly affects who can justify buying it ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
1703,"fair enough!

&#x200B;

mine was terrible but I did a factory restore on phone and repaired. Now I‚Äôm at 80% battery at the end of the day"
1704,"Makes sense, I hadn't thought of that! Very cool."
1705,Charge.
1706,"oh wait a minute so even the GPS only version can do this streaming if my iPhone is at home or did you mean it has to be the cellular version for that to work?

Additionally, is there a WhatsApp version for the watch?"
1707,"I charge it right before I go to sleep. Wake up at about 85%, end the day at about 40%."
1708,Or in the morning while you‚Äôre showering/coffee etc if you have time
1709,On the drive to work
1710,I keep a charger on my desk at work. Charge it during my morning heads down work
1711,I charge when I take a shower and get ready. Sometimes I‚Äôll just charge it overnight when I don‚Äôt care about tracking.
1712,My breaking point came when I had a new client pitch meeting. I woke up feeling fine until I checked Auto Sleep and the data showed a lot of disrupted sleep. That info made me less confident in the meeting. I was expecting to be tired. I deleted the app that morning. Data I can‚Äôt act on is just noise to me.
1713,"> Gonna get some great sleep when in get in bed tonight.

Legitimate question though, *how* do you do that? Does the app give any practical advice or just a general ‚Äúsleep better next time?‚Äù Isn‚Äôt the whole point in most cases that the person doesn‚Äôt *know* what‚Äôs disrupting their sleep? Could be allergies, dry air, sleep apnea, etc. I really hope that if Apple implements native sleep tracking, they find a way to make it a more practical thing you can act on, and not just raw data."
1714,It's an interesting POV and one that didn't occur to me. Personally I like tracking my sleep for the long term reports. I don't really look at it on a day to day basis. I like using it to make sure I'm getting enough sleep and that I'm not trending in a wrong direction.
1715,Should already be active inside the Health App.
1716,[deleted]
1717,"True, but idk why but I'm super used to the physical design of Apple AirPods, even wired Apple headphones. Idk if there is anything else similar to this on the market, but this is why I always come back to this design hands down."
1718,"There are no negatives with closing your rings. Except of course that you're beholden to a device on your wrist, but it's actually good for you ü§£"
1719,"Read more carefully: I spouted my opinion that it‚Äôs 50% overpriced. That‚Äôs based on the fact that it is, in fact, my opinion that the MSRP is about fifty percent higher than I‚Äôm willing to pay. Middle-school reading comprehension would help."
1720,"Well I meant 3 years minimum. I can't see any reason someone would need to upgrade before that, particularly with how powerful the Series 3 and later are. I will be shocked if a Series 5 can't last 5 years easily."
1721,"Series 5 44mm and every night, which is annoying"
1722,"I believe the GPS version will only do this if it is connected to WiFi.

I have no idea on WhatsApp, I don‚Äôt use it as I value my privacy ;-)"
1723,"There's no WhatsApp app available on Apple Watch but as what u/jazzy_handz mentioned, if you are using a cellular Apple Watch but do not have your iPhone with you (but it is online: either via cellular data or wi-fi), you will receive the notifications because it is automatically set to mirror.

&#x200B;

The GPS only model will not be able to do that."
1724,"But then how do I count the calories of me turning the wheel?

The best solution is to buy 2 /s"
1725,Same here! I used it with my Fitbit years ago only to realize i almost never get a good nights sleep. (Which is probably why I‚Äôm so out of it so often). I‚Äôm doing everything i can to get a good nights sleep but thinking about it makes me lose even more sleep. It‚Äôs why i decided to stay away sleep apps on my Apple Watch.
1726,"Part of it is a coping mechanism to get through the day -- knowing how great bed will feel that evening.

The other part of it is that if I got poor sleep, I will probably sleep solid the following night simply because I'm more exhausted. But I'll also be better to myself as I'm winding down my day to get better sleep: Start my routine a little earlier, maybe have an extra cup of sleepy tea, maybe some ZQuill if I'm stressed and didn't have any the night before. Add another blanket if its gotten colder. Kick the cat out of my room if she's being a whore."
1727,"It's useful if you find your sleeping isn't always great and you want to know why. It may be useful to see the affect of stress, alcohol, etc. on your sleep - you might never know otherwise - and can help you make changes if you don't like what you're seeing and you can correlate the data to how you feel.

An example: I often fall asleep with my airpods in, listening to a podcast. But when I wake up in the morning, I notice my airpods are almost always placed on my bedside table. I rarely remember taking them out. Autosleep shows that I typically do this out an hour or so into my sleep. But that's a problem - when I'm not wearing airpods I hit deep sleep about an hour in. So sleeping with airpods, I've found, can sort of waste the first hour of my sleep. So I try not to fall asleep with my airpods in.

It's not essential. It's not a game-changer. Like all aspects of the watch, I feel, it just helps a little bit. And that's fine by me.

Edit: another example. The CLEAR difference in Autosleep's data between drinking and not drinking, especially wine, gave me reason to give up drinking pretty much all together. It explained why I was so fatigued for days despite not having a hangover. So that's pretty great.

I'm not surprised Apple is working on their own sleep tracker, though. I think Autosleep's calibration sucks - the data isn't super accurate. But it's better than anything else I've used."
1728,Cheers
1729,"Uh, no"
1730,"I charge my S3 overnight as well.  Not because it needs it, but because that is my routine.

I can remember it being under 50% by the end of the day."
1731,"Now boys, no need to start a fight."
1732,Guess you don't really use it then
1733,"How do you use yours?

Mines used as timepiece, notification receiver, iMessage writer, activity monitor, media controller etc."
1734,"I find it annoying that most reviews are complaining that the user interface is difficult to use and it takes a learning curve. Well of course it would, it's a new product with an original/unfamiliar OS on it, how long did it take them to learn the iPhone when they first picked it up. 

I understand it is a viable complaint but they should know that there will be a learning curve to learn any new device. 

I also understand that the Apple Watch should seamlessly integrate into our lives, but with any new product it will take some learning and adapting to a new OS."
1735,"Look at the original iPhone and original iPad reviews.  Both are the same type of thing.  Cool idea, yet ""poor execution.""

Now the iPhone is essentially the best-selling phone on the market and the iPad is one of the most popular tablets.  Give it time, Ô£øWatch will be quite popular in time."
1736,"Some of those issues also had nothing to do with the watch itself, like plugging the charger wrong into the wall, which was just a mistake on their part. Overall I don't this review is a very accurate account of the watch experience. "
1737,"People have such short memories. The reason the iPad didn't receive this criticism was because it's OS was nearly identical to the iPhone's. Now, when Apple actually innovates to bring a fresh OS to market, these so called ""tech"" journalists can't seem to appreciate that and are calling the software's fresh workflow a detriment to the device. 


Not only that, but if you think back to the first iPhone, when it initially released no one knew how to use it. It was only once you began to see it in the wild, observing people using it and seeing Apple's marketing ads at play that by the time you actually picked one up for yourself, you figured it out."
1738,"I agree, right now I think the biggest issue that the watch seems to be slow to respond and notifications are slow to work. The third party apps are not a concern for me, only how slow it seems to be."
1739,"I mean‚Ä¶ BABIES can pick up an iPhone and use it, so‚Ä¶ "
1740,Though I suppose it doesn't really hurt making note of ALL their trouble they have despite it being caused by the watch or by human error. It is kind of obnoxious to do so though.
1741,"Exactly, I just find these reviews that state that the OS is so overwhelming and after learning it it becomes a breeze, well obviously.

It would be better if they didn't have such a negative reaction to it for something we have all have to go through when learning a new OS. "
1742,"That might be a small concern for me, speed, I had a pebble and I am used to the slow loading times due to the pebble trying to pull information from my phone, I am sure they will speed it up in updates. 

It is initial launch, there are bound to be bugs and optimization opportunities. 

I don't really have any other reservations about the watch, I am set on purchasing it, there isn't really anything that has me on the fence. "
1743,[deleted]
1744,"I have one too and as far as that notification speed goes I can handle comparable performance. However the main annoyance I would have is the raise to view for the screen. With my pebble I don't ever have the issue of not seeing the time when I raise my arm, but with the apple watch it may not work every time. First world problem that will get fixed I know, but that's my only real complaint from these reviews. I still plan to get one."
1745,"Obviously, they are more likely to mention their short comings in a review, but the wording and the tone when talking about how difficult the learning curve is shouldn't be so negative-- well yes, it is going to be a steep curve because it is a new type of OS that very few has had time to use, it is good that Apple developed an entirely new type of environment on a 1 inch display that is integrated with the iPhone.

I just think the tone and outlook from reviewers who have such a big issue with the learning curve on the Apple Watch seems so closed minded."

1747,I feel like you are better off just getting a second hand Apple Watch. Since they have to clone the OS and you won‚Äôt get all of the features. The heart rate sensor is probably fake and you won‚Äôt be able to send text through iMessage.
1748,The heart rate sensor is 100% fake. Put it on the box and try it.

1758,"I cannot say if that‚Äôs the same model. If you want the same as mine, get it from Jenny whose link has been provided."
1759,"I predict the overall trend will be: The bigger screen is nice but not worth the upgrade from the more recent models (5 or 6). If you have a 4 or then consider it, anything older and it‚Äôs a great move.

1770,"Hello all - I was one of those with the watch, review went live today. Happy to answer any questions! Been using the 45mm green version."
1771,Sometime between now and Friday
1772,Are you kidding? Ijustine will tell you it‚Äôs the greatest thing ever and you need to upgrade. You need to get this watch. Blah blah
1773,"I think there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll say the difference in screen size isn‚Äôt as noticeable as the marketing makes it seem.

I‚Äôm upgrading from a 5 because the battery is struggling a bit to get me through a day, so no real regrets either way, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big leap this year."
1774,"honestly who are these brain dead reviewers that think there is any sizeable amount of people buying a new Apple Watch year over year

It‚Äôs like they are making reviews for each other only"
1775,"This was basically my consensus in ordering it. 
I didn‚Äôt get the 5 or 6 for the same reason. Said fuggit I‚Äôve had my S4 for 3 years now. I‚Äôll do it."
1776,I guess I‚Äôll be checking my feed at nine am.
1777,Fingers crossed it‚Äôs better than my series 4 that only charges to 75% and dies within a few hours.
1778,‚ÄúThis is too much like the series 6 and not enough like all the rumors and my expectations. Apple Watch bad.‚Äù
1779,No way the big reviewers are waiting for their watches like the rest of us. They‚Äôve most likely had them for a week.
1780,"I usually like his blog / reviews, but that watch review is meandering and a little confusing."
1781,"I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve ever actually watched an iJustine review and in fact totally forgot her channel even existed. Does she do decent reviews or is it just ‚Äúbuy buy buy‚Äù?"
1782,"My thing with iJustine is that I actually can stand her bias because she is upfront about it. I know exactly what I‚Äôm getting when I watch her videos: a sometimes exaggerated, yet sincere Apple devoted fangirly mess. 

Ofc for honest product reviews I go elsewhere, but it‚Äôs cool for the sake production and entertainment to check out her channel"
1783,iJustine is queen!
1784,"I‚Äôm also on the 5 and considering a 7 for the same reason, but I‚Äôm kind of anticipating battery life to decrease this year, though. The series 7 will have a larger, brighter, higher res screen, the same processor as last year, and almost the same overall size, which to me points to:

-	Battery size will likely not be able to increase to any significant degree
-	same processor driving a more powerful display means likely an efficiency loss."
1785,"1. Maybe, just maybe they like tech and are passionate about products?
2. I'd bet a dollar to a doughnut that the majority of their followers expect a review on all new products? even if just to keep updated on what's out there? 
3. This guy has great unbiased reviews: [https://www.youtube.com/c/Mrwhosetheboss](https://www.youtube.com/c/Mrwhosetheboss)
4. ...."
1786,Turning off walkie-talkie mode saved me like 20% by the end of the day. Before the watch would just die in about 10ish hours. I‚Äôm at 81% battery health now though
1787,"I see, thanks. Yeah I‚Äôm waiting to see how dark is their blue so I can decide. Also waiting for the first wave to go by so maybe I can get one in the store in a month or so"
1788,She is heavily biased where a marques will tell the goods and the bads if any product he‚Äôs reviewing
1789,"she's still the same fangirl as she was on day1. 

If Apple came up with a night table clock the shape of a turd, she'd be ecstatic and tell everyone to buy one. She has Zero credibility. Where a MKHD or even DREW are not so biased."
1790,"Completely agree. What works in her favour is she isn‚Äôt pretending to be something she‚Äôs not. She fully embraces she‚Äôs a fangirl and I think there‚Äôs a place for her content. Her content is accessible for a lot of people who aren‚Äôt typically into unboxings or tech reviews. It‚Äôs a testament to why she‚Äôs been around so long. 

I‚Äôm not gonna go to her for unbiased, in-depth reviews and that‚Äôs okay. Say I wanna see what every colour iMac looks like or how the new iPhone performs in everyday real world usage then sure I‚Äôll check her videos out."
1791,Her sister is actually hotter I think lol
1792,"I think possibly you misunderstood my comment. 

I just want the reviewers to review the product itself. On its own terms. 

Not through the lens of ‚Äòshould you upgrade from last years version‚Äô


Next to no one is upgrading from series 6 to 7



I agree with all your points."
1793,"my guess of mkhbd review: the watch doesn't really need a review because it's basically a series 6 with a slightly bigger display, but here we go anyway"
1794,Get some help
1795,This is exactly what the review was lmao
1796,And he‚Äôs had one for 3 weeks‚Ä¶
1797,Huh? She‚Äôs kind of cute‚Ä¶far less obnoxious
1798,haha! i was pretty darn close
1799,I don‚Äôt get why it matters who is attractive or not here
1800,It was a joke and people seem to have to remind her daily.  Though I wouldn‚Äôt mine being in her position with all the freebies she gets. Probably makes a nice chunk on YouTube as well.
1801,"Not a parent, but my 9 year old cousin has a hand me down Apple Watch linked to her moms phone, and it works fantastic. Apple released an update with watchOS 7 that included a ton of features for child safety, and made it so a watch could be linked to and controlled through a parent phone. Definitely recommend it, including the article with more details on using a watch to track your child. 

https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/09/apple-extends-the-apple-watch-experience-to-the-entire-family/"
1802,"So I don‚Äôt have kids, but I am an after school coach for preschool and elementary. I‚Äôve seen dozens of kids wearing them. My thoughts are, it‚Äôs a watch, screen is too small for them to get distracted and play games on it like some of us did with the first release of smart phones. You can stay in contact with them at any time, and they can reach you, the parent, as well. It‚Äôs got the find my, so you know where they are at, at all times (results for this may vary depending on how old your kid is and if they don‚Äôt want their parents knowing there their every location). In my book it‚Äôs the best way to keep in touch with your kid, while knowing they aren‚Äôt going to get into more trouble for having a phone at school."
1803,"Just keep in mind, that Family Setup requires a certain configuration from the carriers too, so this feature is only available in a handful of countries, and not at every carrier where cellular apple watches are otherwise supported. [you can check the list here](https://www.apple.com/watch/cellular/#table-family-setup)"
1804,Thanks for this! I‚Äôve wondered what educators‚Äô thoughts are on smart watches.
1805,"Good point I forgot to add, lol"
1806,Thank y‚Äôall for the info!
1807,"I love strong. 

Been using it since SW4. 

I never had the thought to explore any other options, and never ever had to."
1808,I could never get this to work like I wanted so it wasn‚Äôt worth subscribing. After I got a new watch with fitness plus free for 3 months so I‚Äôm using that
1809,I love strong.
1810,"I agree. Been using it for a long time, definitely worth the yearly subscription fee for the pro version if you‚Äôre working out several times a week with lots of different exercises."
1811,I subscribed and tried using it for a month. Coming from JEFIT my issue was with how llimited was Strong‚Äôs database of exercises. I also missed JEFIT‚Äôs muscle recovery insights. I did like Strong‚Äôs warm up set calculator but I ended up going back to JEFIT.
1812,I use the free tier - more than enough for what I need.
1813,"Yeah I was trying it on the free version but I couldn‚Äôt get it working. All I wanted to do was on a custom exercise start off with 6 reps, increasing by 1 rep each week. Then once I get to 12 reps change it to 2 sets and 6 reps and just keep doing that for every exercise I add"
1814,"> The watch band fits me ok. I have it on the third hole from the end. What I really need is another hole between the second and third. I'll check into a different strap sometime.

Sport loop for sure. The velcro closure makes it much more adjustable. The solo loop and braided loop are basically sized the same way as the sport band, so you'd have to choose the smaller size. I think that they're a little more forgivable fitting than the sport band, but you still may get annoyed by how tight it is. I prefer the look of the sport band over the sport loop, but it will be easier to get the fit right."
1815,"if you're not getting a good fit with the band you have on, try the other end of the band in the box. the holes are offset from each other, and if both sizes of band ends fit, you're never in between holes.

sport loop will give you a perfect fit, but you can try the other band end while you wait to get a sport loop."
1816,Have you tried adjusting the text size in settings? Could help a lot.
1817,"Thanks, I'll check out the band with velcro."
1818,"I tried the other shorter band, but it's tight even when I use the bottommost hole."
1819,I did make the text a bit larger and that helped. (For some reason making it too large caused eye strain as well.)
1820,"I just got my Series 7 about a week ago and I love it so much. It's my first apple watch too! It's especially fun if you have other apple watch-using friends as you can do weekly challenges in the Activity app and get achievements when you win :)

If your primary goal is to count your steps and get your heart rate, you may be better off getting an earlier model like SE? Since it does the job and it's gonna be cheaper too.

I decided to get Series 7 because I liked the screen size and I figured I'm not gonna upgrade for a while so I should just get the newest model. I also thought the blood oxygen feature was cool lol"
1821,You seriously need to go to the Apple web site and look at all the info Apple give on using and owning an AW. Also there are lots of reviews on AW on YouTube and other tech review sites. Practically everyone here on this sub would recommend a S7 as it‚Äôs the latest model (this is a sub for AW after all) with the most features but also would recommend the SE too if money is an issue. All AWs and Apple Health app do not prioritise step counting as a primary judge of fitness.
1822,"Go to youtube and check the channel of Desfit. He did some extensive testing of different Apple Watch models in the last two years:

1823,"My first apple watch was the SE and I loved it, now i upgraded to the 7 and i have to say it was 100% worth it, so much better performance overall, all animations are fluid and no lag, and of course you get all the features a series 6 had + faster charging

No regrets upgrading"
1824,I have the Apple Watch SE and it does the job for workout. I have more than enough info I need for when I work out. Only drawbacks are you get no ECG and always on display. That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt like about mine. Other than that I‚Äôm happy with mine and hasn‚Äôt let me down.

1837,"You don‚Äôt need the cellular model. You can store music and podcasts on the watch to listen offline, I do it all the time. Most gyms also have wifi.

The only reason they might need the cellular version is if they want to stream music or makes calls/send messages."

1902,I haven‚Äôt tried that yet I synced it with my phone to where I can call and text but I haven‚Äôt been able to play music from it
1903,Why would you need the calculator on the watch üòÇcheck your phone for that
1904,üòÇüòÇlet‚Äôs hope so
1905,Yes your not going to get an apple watch with IOS system for 30$
1906,"Because everyone has there own budget, I don‚Äôt want to buy a watch for 200+ when I can buy a similar thing that looks the same as the Apple Watch but for 30$"
1907,To show Apple fan bois/gals has gullible they are. LOL
1908,Yeah but AirPods is different because your not getting the same sound quality
1909,It has Bluetooth it can connect with anything that has Bluetooth I have an iPhone XR and it works perfect

1919,Do you think it was accurate?
1920,Makes sense but you could buy an older generation for a cheaper model if you wanted to utilize the Apple Ecosystem
1921,sorry I'm stupid but so you also cant text on the apple watch?

1929,"Don't mean to sound like that guy, but it does not ""does the same thing as the Apple Watch"" you can't sync workouts since there's no fitness app, I can't change tracks bc it looks like Spotify/Apple Music sync isn't on there either, same with my messages or notifications"

1958,"I like mine because it keeps me from grabbing my phone all the time. I can see who‚Äôs calling and ‚Äòdecline‚Äô, quick-glance at text to see if it‚Äôs important. I also use the voice text feature while driving a lot; so a safety thing for me too.

It‚Äôll click when a gps turn is required too ."
1959,"Simply put‚Ä¶ it has not only improved my life, it‚Äôs saved my life.

I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with Afib (atrial fibrillation). I‚Äôve been complaining to my doc for years about palpitations and skipped beats‚Ä¶ and she always said ‚Äúyou have a panic disorder, that is to be expected‚Äù. I bought the latest watch two weeks ago and in that time, the watch heart data helped me convince her that it wasn‚Äôt just the usual anxiety."
1960,"Apple Watch changed my life. I have it since september 2020 and I wore it every day since then.

However, it is a personal matter. On TikTok there are many reels of people claiming to have wasted money leaving the AW unloaded in a drawer. This is not my case. The watch made me want to run and train and I have never stopped since. The function of the rings works on my person, despite being a person who has always been fit, I used to have that extra kilos that I can now keep under control and do good for my health. 

Another point is that it is definitely a nice item, so it is also very nice to wear for everyday life or an elegant dinner. Best money spent in my life honestly.

&#x200B;

Favourite Watch-face: Chronograph pro. But I switch them everyday!"
1961,"Personally I wouldn‚Äôt say it improved my life a lot; I would say I was improving my own life through careful curation of my technology and AW suited my needs. 

Mainly I love the apple watch because I love to wear a watch and it is the best digital watch I‚Äôve ever known. Get bored of it? Swipe to a new face for a new look or change band materials for a new feel. Perfect."
1962,"It‚Äôs life changing for me

Gives me the extra boost I need to exercise and it‚Äôs a motivator to close the rings every day 

Also getting emails, texts, and calls through the watch is an added bonus"
1963,"I got my watch almost purely for fitness. Despite it not being specifically a fitness watch, my research led me to conclude it is the best watch for fitness for the price. I got the Apple Watch 3 for $175. 

I have had it for a year and two weeks, and it inspires me to push harder to reach my goals in every workout. I really think it has improved my fitness significantly because i have a tangible goal to reach."
1964,EDIT: i bit the bullet. i‚Äôm enjoying this waaayyy too much right now. $175 for a 44MM SE GPS is a helluva steal. i will make a update post soon
1965,"Honestly aesthetics in the end. First few weeks you'll try have fun messing around with all the feature then you'll just end up not using it for all it has. Only to see notifications if you're walking, your phone is not near you and to check time. Especially if you're in highschool and you're only part time it's really not that useful. And it's yet another thing to charge. You forget to charge it? Can't use it. And then if you really don't go out a lot then it's just gonna sit around eventually. My two cents is you could do a lot more with $190 than get a smart watch. If you want it to track fitness you can get a fitness band for way cheaper it also tells you the time, some even notifications. Then you can use the rest of the money on something else you really want. You want to just tell the time? Get a watch. You'll realise as well that you're just gonna reach for your phone anyway when you get a notification and such. A smart watch is a luxury not a necessity. If you're worried you could spend the money on other stuff especially if you don't have much already, don't buy it and spend it on something more useful to you."
1966,"I love mine. I feel weird when I don‚Äôt have it with me (forgot my charger when on a trip for a few days). I track my sleep, but also find it incredibly helpful for notifications and quick responses to texts."
1967,The Apple Watch made me not fat
1968,[deleted]
1969,"You might not be into fitness *now*but after getting mine, I started to care about the little things more. My heart rate, how many steps I‚Äôm getting, etc. and started comparing that to my friends (even if they just use their phone which also counts steps albeit not as accurately. 

I love my watch, it‚Äôs beautiful, I can customize it, I can check my steps and heart rate, I can do some fitness (it even automatically detects work outs like riding a bike and can save them after the fact even if I didn‚Äôt tell it I was riding a bike let‚Äôs say). 

I also use Siri a lot for reminding me to do stuff, and the silent alarm is insanely useful. Those are some of the things it can also do. If NONE of that seems of any use, just get a regular watch. 

It doesn‚Äôt have to change your life completely to be worth it. Those are all things I can do on my phone, but I also don‚Äôt need to have my phone with me to do like almost any of that. At work (I work in manufacturing), I can‚Äôt always be checking my phone but I can get away with talking to my wrist to reply to a text or anything else of the sort. 

You can also obviously reply to texts and compose messages on it which is awesome and I could see that being useful in high school now lol. 

And also, it can text loud noises and monitor noise levels in db, which is very useful to me. And it can remind you to stop and do breathing exercises which can help with anxiety and mindfulness. I say go for it man. It‚Äôs extremely good for just getting you to do bare minimum things to improve your life."
1970,"I‚Äôve mine since christmas, and I‚Äôve drived it daily since then. First months you will mess with the features, than you will start use it in a more practical way, like another user pointed out. But it‚Äôs still pretty useful to answer calls quickly, check the weather or your calendar. Also, it helped me to work out more. Not just a bit, a lot. I‚Äôm now doing some kind of exercise everyday to close the rings and get the achievement."
1971,"I like mine because I had a tendency to walk out and forget my phone. What made me get it was because my dad passed away and my mom was trying to get ahold of me to deliver the news, but I had forgotten my phone at home. I went out that day and purchased an Apple Watch"
1972,I held off one because for the longest time I didn‚Äôt care about the fitness stuff. Quiet honestly still don‚Äôt. I got mine for two reasons. First - I‚Äôm a sucker for cool tech stuff. Second - I‚Äôm trying to detach myself from my phone a bit and if that means using my watch to play music while I go on 30 minute dog walks that‚Äôs fine with me.
1973,"I own a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2. It is definitely still fun to use. It is really great to have notifications on my wrist. My phone isn't always in my pocket, sometimes it is in the bag or in some family member's bag, so then it  is really useful. Also for taking up phone calls. The fitness features are really good. I also track my sleep with the watch, and the app gives me a score on how good my sleep was. 

The heart rate feature is nice to have, but I am young so I don't really look at that much. I don't really use many apps on it, but I would like to have a WhatsApp app or Telegram on it. But WhatsApp app doesn't exist, and Telegram is only on WearOS or WatchOS. The app ecosystem isn't great in Tizen... But you have an Apple Watch, so that's no problem for you. Also, the new health features on the newer watches are really nice, like the SpO2 (blood oxygen) and the new body composition on the Samsung Galaxy Watch4. I have a Xiaomi Smart Scale for the Body Composition, imagine how cool it is to just do that from your wrist! 

So I have told you some negatives and positives, but before I sum it all up, I have to tell you what I paid for it. I paid ‚Ç¨280 (euros), which might be close to 300 dollars, and I bought the Stainless Steel one. The Aluminum ones were much cheaper, around 180 dollars. I'd say that's worth it, if you can find it at that price. But the Apple Watch SE without AOD and ECG sensor is priced around 280 dollars, which is a little overpriced in my opinion.

At the end, if you will really use the health and fitness features and notifications that are built-in, I would say it's worth it, because those are the features most people use. And if you don't use those, then you probably almost won't use it, which makes it not worth it."
1974,I have ADHD and it‚Äôs been an absolute game changer for me. Just the use of being able to press a button on it to locate my iPhone was worth the money alone.
1975,"IMO, the watch isn‚Äôt going to make you more efficient/ productive. 

I own an SE and I like it, but I use it just as a watch and fitness tracker. All notifications are turned completely off. 

As a fitness tracker, it‚Äôs fantastic. As a productivity booster, it‚Äôs a gimmick."
1976,I find it really helpful when I‚Äôm at work since my hands are often dirty. If I get a text/call I can see it quickly and see if it‚Äôs important.
1977,"I made it a point to get the most out of it that I can.

I primarily use it for the gym and spotify, weather of course, the time, and i found watch calendar app called Fantastical that works real well with my gcal and use siri to add new appointments to it. 

I also use reminders on it religiously as a to do list.

Its a high price tag for a watch.. but if you're in the apple eco system, it syncs seamlessly as everything else does, but you can live without it."
1978,"Totally depends on what YOU like, in my opinion I think the SE is great for everything i need. Reminders, notifications, weather, and the calculator. I find myself using it more than my phone during the day."
1979,"I‚Äôd say yes, $190 for that watch is definitely worth it. That value won‚Äôt go down much either at that price. So if you did buy and decided nah, you can sale it and get back a lot of that money. 

Myself, I love mine. It‚Äôs definitely nice to quickly answer calls and texts, control Apple music, quickly check the weather, change my house thermostat, can‚Äôt forget the time, and it undoubtedly helps with health if you follow through. 

I went without mine and missed it so I had to get another."
1980,"I for a long time wasn‚Äôt interested in it, but I wanted to be a little more active so I can Aly got one. Been loving it ever since. If you‚Äôd be interesting in the fitness features I think it‚Äôs worth it. Just for notifications - then I wouldn‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs worth it"
1981,"My apple watch motivates me to exercise more. To close my rings. Without it I would not be in the shape I am in today. I use it to track my sleep each night and it wakes me with vibration in the morning, which allows my wife to continue sleeping without being disturbed. I love it when I drive and it vibrates my wrist when I use Apple maps to tell me when I should turn. I am listen to change songs and respond to texts, and answer calls without having to pull out my phone. I also use it to controlling lighting in my house through Siri and HomeKit. 

I use it to receive texts from co-workers and timers while lecturing so I don't go over time and can receive info if I need to cut it short or drag it out. 

I wish the battery lasted longer than a day, but that is fine as I have it charging when I am getting ready in the morning. 

To me the Apple Watch has been life changing."
1982,"It‚Äôs absolutely worth it!
Even more for $190!"
1983,"Since I started using my watch as a fitness device, I‚Äôve lost 17kg or 37 pounds. The rings keep me motivated to exercise everyday and because of that im the fittest and healthiest I‚Äôve ever been.

So to me, it absolutely is worth it"
1984,Likely different for me as I'm much older. It encouraged me to get out and about and as a result I lost some weight. I can get notifications at work when I can't have my phone with me and it's also helped me to get better sleep. Frankly had I not had the watch I'd have gone back to Android.
1985,"I‚Äôve lost nearly 30lbs, dropped my BMI by 6, lowered my blood pressure to normal levels, blood work is much better than it‚Äôs been in over a decade, I sleep better, etc - all the while being able to not have to bring my phone everywhere I go. Not to mention I‚Äôm no longer distracted by my phone, especially while working. 

Nah I guess it wasn‚Äôt worth it for me lol."
1986,"The main reason I that pushed me to get one is I found out it can detect falls. I rent out a space to work in and in often on ladders or just doing stuff there late at night. I have also occasionally had fainting spells. The watch will call emergency services If I fall and can‚Äôt respond. It‚Äôs a little bit of insurance. 

I also like that it allows me to be untethered to my phone I don‚Äôt like carrying it around all the time, especially on walks. I like to be unburdened.  

I have found it more useful than I expected. Can I live without it, yes. But I do like it, and I‚Äôm the kind of person who holds on to devices forever.  So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say worth is a matter of how you would use it."
1987,"I‚Äôve had mine for 2.5 years now.  What I like about it:
1. It‚Äôs a watch - time, timers, alarms, date, I forgot what it was like to wear a useful watch.  
2. Fitness - The rings really do motivate me to be more active than I was before.  Now I have to close all the rings and meet the challenges which Has been great during this coronavirus era of staying at home.  
3. Ping my iPhone - It seems silly but instead of asking for someone to call my phone when it‚Äôs somewhere in the house just pinging it has been great.  (It falls between the crack of your car seat, under the couch, etc.)  
4.  Outlook meeting details.  I setup a watch face for work, and the middle is an Oulook complication that tells me when and where the next meeting is.  
5.  World Time - I work with people on the other side of the globe, so another work complication is world time for their time zone.  

Lesser things:  
1. When using AirPods and playing something on your phone, you can use the Digital Crown to adjust the volume.  
2. Easy use of HomeKit - When I‚Äôm exercising I can use it to lock/unlock the door.  
3.  Remote iPhone Camera control - for group photos it‚Äôs nice to see the framing and to trigger the shutter remotely.

Overall, I‚Äôm glad I got the series 3 when I did.  It wasn‚Äôt too much and I‚Äôve gotten a lot out of it.  I‚Äôm considering upgrading to a S7 Cellular to get the extra health items and to be able to stream Apple Music directly without a phone when I workout."
1988,"I was feeling the same way when I was about to get mine, and I decided to go for it in the end. IMO, totally worth it. I thought it would only be useful for when I exercise, but it actually motivates you to improve your lifestyle. It reminds you to breathe, to stand for a while when you have been sitting for too long and it is helpful to control your overall health. Being able to answer calls, see your notifications and reply to texts directly from your wrist when you don't have your phone next to you really comes in handy as well. And tbh $190 is a bargain, so I would definitely get it."
1989,"I bought my watch in May 2020 and have worn it everyday since so that I could use it for fitness tracking, weight loss, and constant connectivity to my phone. I am down 98lbs and have increased muscle mass because my watch has motivated me to keep up activity streaks. Also, its been super convenint responding to texts using the watch while my phone is in my pocket. I can use the Walkie Talkie feature to talk to Walkie Talkie other watch users from anywhere and its a legit walkie talkie. I like that I can utilize my Reminders and Calendar from my watch without having to take my phone out of my pocket. I can make calls from the watch if I have my hands full and Siri is super helpful with home automations with my lights and blinds, right from my wrist.

The watch has been a life changer for sure for me. So yes, VERY well worth it, especially since I take care of it and have a case and screen protector so that I can have it for a longer period of time, which really stretches out the cost of the watch.

So for High School, if you were super organized like I was, you'd have ALL of your classes and extracurricular activities in your calendar as well as all your social appointments with friends, camping trips, field trips, birthday parties, etc. Test reminders, reminders to study, reminders to read, reminders to go to bed, etc."
1990,"Apple Watch is certainly not necessary, and definitely depends on your lifestyle, behavior, habits, etc. 

Mine helps me be more active, as i have a software engineering desk job. The heart applications help me be more mindful with my anxiety. I was worried that I wasn't getting enough physical exercise, so the watch helps me track my progress as I try to improve my own life.

Certainly you can do all of this with a phone, or even less."
1991,"It‚Äôs been one of the best gifts I have ever gotten.
I got the series 6 and the ekg really made a big different in monitoring my heart sensor.
I wear mine very say and love the compliments I get.
The only issue im having is that it‚Äôs better to upgrade with every new purchase"
1992,"Unless you already have an iPhone it would be a huge waste of limited resources. If you do, then research what it can and can't do. If your primary reason is that it looks cool then don't get it."
1993,"I‚Äôm using mine a lot more than I expected to ‚Ä¶ it has definitely motivated me to exercise more ( tho I guess I already was motivated because I bought the watch in the first place to replace a dying Fitbit). Got it on sale and haven‚Äôt regretted it for a moment - I‚Äôm not using it for sleep tracking now because I was getting a little obsessed ‚Ä¶ but it still is keeping me ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù because it tallies every move and encourages you without it feeling like nagging. I read a financial comparison between buying stock in Apple vs spending the same money on equipment over the years ‚Ä¶ the stock payoff is waaay better, but the equipment is more fun. At this price, I think you‚Äôd enjoy it and it may help establish some healthy habits and productivity that will serve you well in the future. You don‚Äôt need it, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it at $190. It also does neat little things like unlock your Mac, use Apple Pay with a wave of the hand, find your iPhone, saves wear and tear on your phone battery, etc"
1994,It‚Äôs helped me a lot mostly for keeping healthy
1995,It‚Äôs a great addition to the phone. I use it throughout the day and I have lost 15 pounds since getting it.
1996,"I use mine as a watch as well as a fitness tracker. I can‚Äôt saw how accurate the tracking is but it lets me know when I‚Äôm being too sedentary and helps me convince my brain to squirt happy juices when I accomplish things. Used it for calls maybe twice and I‚Äôm not a fan but it‚Äôs been a few watchOS versions since I tried so‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt have the cell plan option and really don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs worth it but that‚Äôs just me."
1997,The Apple Watch helped me lose 20kilos and start a habit of being active through the ring closing app in activity. I also track fasts and meditations with it. So yes it‚Äôs definitely a super important product in my life if not the most important. If you don‚Äôt really care about the health features however it‚Äôs a pretty pointless product. The notifications on the wrist are nice but not game changing. I hardly use the calculator and the other apps at all.
1998,"I think it‚Äôs only worth it if the following apply to you:
1. You‚Äôre pretty into fitness, and will enjoy having goals to beat, and friends to compete with on the watch.

2. You would normally wear a wristwatch daily, to check the time etc, or perhaps match a style you dress in. 

I‚Äôve had S4 and S5. S5 has been better by far and away, because of AOD"
1999,"Sounds like you don‚Äôt need it.  I only use the Apple Watch to track my fitness, for text notification, and meeting notification. If you‚Äôre in school 8 hours a day then you‚Äôll definitely have no use for it in that 8 hours.  I think it‚Äôs a waste if you‚Äôre not in an office and use it for exercise daily."
2000,"I had the SE (4G+GPS) for about 5 months then sold it.   


I didn‚Äôt find it to be worthwhile as an everyday watch. Needs too much attention to charging everyday and wasn‚Äôt sufficiently standalone. Not enough customisation of how I want the screen to display info to serve as a day-long tool.  


I did find it to be good as a sports activity tracker, but then again fairly high priced for that segment of devices.

In the end it felt like wasted money sitting around too much, so I sold it to recoup. I might one day pick up a used GPS-only one for when I‚Äôm biking etc, if I find a cheap one. Would not pay full price at current price Structures as the value was just not there for me."
2001,"I use my watch 80% for Apple pay, 10% workouts and 10% notifications + cooking timers. 

If it wasn't for the pandemic, where faceid for Apple pay is very inconvenient with a mask, I would've not gotten a watch again (I had a series 3; 2 year break from Apple watch, and now I have a series 5). 

It has not changed/saved my life but it made it slightly easier. 

This being said, 190$ is a steal for an SE and I would get it.

PS. I live in Europe. Apple pay is accepted everywhere. I know this is not the case in the US."
2002,"Life changing in a sense that it has rekindled my fascination with consumer technology. I strongly believe that Siri, Watch, and AirPods will make my iPhone redundant a few years from now.

To give you some context, I prefer ThinkPads to Macs and Android to iOS.

Our company is developing a whole ecosystem around Apple Watch and Apple Health so we‚Äôre fully invested.

Someone once told me that they got the very first Apple Watch to stay current with most recent technology. I‚Äôm ashamed that it took me that long to realize that I complete agree with them.

So, I‚Äôd say, go for it!"
2003,Of course. I couldn‚Äôt live without my Apple Watch because I am a fitness enthusiast. I have the series 6 and trying to decide if I‚Äôm going to get the 7 or wait until the 8 because I‚Äôm looking for more health upgrades
2004,I have seizures occasionally so just the fact it can let me get help sold me on it.
2005,"I like mine, using it all the time to find my phone lol"
2006,I love my Apple Watch. My dad bought me a 5 last year. I used it a lot during the pandemic and stopped using it for a few months but I‚Äôve been back to using it everyday. I have a 9 month old so it‚Äôs super easy to not have my phone one me but still able to answer texts. Also I love I can use Apple Pay and not take out my phone.
2007,"High schooler here with a second hand series six (400 CAD, 280USD counting skipped taxes)

I honestly don‚Äôt know, I love the watch and it‚Äôve been helping me with staying in shape for a while, it‚Äôs so nice having everything you need on your watch but the price is pretty expensive, then again I can‚Äôt imagine life without it now

Some things I like:

it tells you exactly where and when-to turn when using GPS by buzzing your wrist

Temperature/weather/time/date a lift away

Unlocks your phone automatically when you have a mask on, life saver

‚ÄúHey Siri, call my dad‚Äù ‚Äúhey Siri, show me pictures of watermelons‚Äù ‚Äúhey Siri, set a timer for 22 minutes‚Äù

I kinda like the idea of a strap collection, I could use a collection anyways since I‚Äôve never had one

Notification read and responses in seconds

Fitness tracking and encouragement, I‚Äôve hit 600 calories per day for 12 days straight now, first time in my life 

Those are the big ones but the small ones are still important, all in all I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it"
2008,"I have a series 5 and I live in NYC, and don‚Äôt have a car so I bike almost everywhere. I really like being able to ask Siri for directions and as I‚Äôm biking either get the taps to tell me if I need to take a turn, or a quick glance to check if I‚Äôm on track. 

I also really like using tap to pay and have pretty much stopped carrying a wallet.

When the series 7 releases I think I‚Äôll upgrade to the cellular model so that I don‚Äôt even need to bring my phone with me :)"
2009,"It‚Äôs not an essential. And I intend to keep my series 5 for several years rather than on a more frequent upgrade cycle like a phone. 

That said, I use it constantly. It has its own separate uses like activity tracking which is great and valuable but my most constant use is in doing things I‚Äôd otherwise do on my phone‚Ä¶ without my phone. Siri requests, smart home control, timers, making and answering phone calls, responding to messages (and not just iMessage, works with other messaging apps, too), quick calendar checks, step tracking, sleep tracking‚Ä¶ and it tells the time. 

It charges in like an hour or less so you can wear it pretty much 24/7, and I do unless going somewhere where it would look out of place."
2010,"I think the Apple Watch is a device that really is in a new niche the way the iPad was when it first came out. It‚Äôs really hard to know in advance if it‚Äôs for you or not. 

A month ago, I was a firm ‚Äúno‚Äù on the Watch. It was cool, but what did I really need it for? 

Three weeks ago, it happened that managed to sell a few items for more cash than I expected and Best Buy was having a major sale on Apple Watches. On a whim, I read up a little again on what the Watch can do and I started to reconsider. I took a few days to think but ultimately decided to pull the trigger and see if the reality of the Watch lived up the usefulness I imagined it could have. 

Two weeks later to today, I feel like I really made the right choice. 

The health features are mostly a novelty to me, but they may see more use as time goes on. 

The big winner for me is all my notifications being mirrored from my phone so I never miss anything. This might not be critical for everyone, but with two young kids this is a lifesaver. Saving a few seconds countless times a day and not needing to fumble my phone out so often really adds up. 

Having selectable little bits of data on the watch face is also saving a lot of time throughout the day. 

Siri/voice dictation on your wrist is more useful than you might imagine. I can have short text exchanges while walking on the street without slowing down to get my phone out and queue commands to the phone without touching the phone. 

Haptic feedback on your wrist makes reminders, alarms and Maps driving directions much less intrusive while at the same time being much more reliable. I don‚Äôt miss turns when my watch taps my wrist but I can keep the audio on my phone off so it doesn‚Äôt bother everybody else in the car."
2011,"It has improved my life a lot. Mainly because of its capability to track the calories you burn and your daily activity. The way I see it is that you can't improve what you can't measure. So, the Apple Watch allows me to improve in this aspect. All the other things are handy, having the calendar readily available, keeping track of the last time I fed my cat, no-screen way of getting GPS directions (and hence, a safer driving experience), and its ability to track my sleep quality are all great extras."
2012,"Aesthetics, really? This thing is ugly as fuck"
2013,Appl
2014,Couldn‚Äôt live without my watch. It‚Äôs a wonderful and truly inspiring bit of kit. Don‚Äôt think I can put a price on that.
2015,"do you wear a watch currently? it‚Äôs good at that.
do you have a iphone? it‚Äôs an excellent addition to that.
do you exercise? it provides some nifty feedback.

it‚Äôs a tool. hammers don‚Äôt build houses, but they help.

you probably can‚Äôt afford the cellular plan for it if $180 for the watch is an issue. consider that a huge con."
2016,"All the above, plus advancing songs while working in the yard. Answering phone if too dirty to actually get phone out."
2017,and find iPhone without asking wife/friend/brother/whoever to call.
2018,"Assuming the GPS click is through apple maps, yes?

Does this work for google maps or waze or any other ones?"
2019,"i‚Äôm close to getting my license soon, so this can definitely be a huge plus for me. thank you for sharing that"
2020,Is this feature worth $500+ though? My Fitbit was $50 and also tells me when someone is calling me.  I also only have to charge my Fitbit once a week instead of every day.
2021,"oh wow, that‚Äôs great to hear! im glad you got it all sorted because that does sound pretty serious"
2022,Was it your heart patterns or the ecg feature?
2023,"I just wanna say I‚Äôm really sorry that your doctor didn‚Äôt believe you. That really sucks, and I hope you‚Äôre able to receive the care you need now"
2024,"Welp, that does it. I already got myself one, but now I'm going to get my spouse to get one too."
2025,Likewise. I‚Äôm in love with my titanium series 6 :)
2026,"‚Ç¨ 190 are nothing IMHO, I would not even think about it honestly. Depends on your age if that is the only money you own, then it's another thing. How old are you?"
2027,"this, im excited for this. having different watch faces. some more casual but useful like infograph modular or sophisticated like california or chronograph"
2028,The Apple Watch goes to the next level when you download Clockolgy app and follow pages on here or Facebook. People design watch faces that are 10x‚Äôs better that the stock faces provided by apple. It will take the watch to a new level!
2029,Can you link me to your update?
2030,"thanks for the insight for one. but i was kinda thinking this too. i don‚Äôt want to look back next month and say ‚Äúthis was a waste‚Äù as i toss it onto my bed. honestly $190 for a glorified watch and the apple logo is a great deal, but i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the deal for me. i‚Äôm definitely gonna think it over, but it‚Äôs more of a luxury than a semi-necessity. *(i was probably going to blow the money on something stupid anyway; i‚Äôm a teenager and it‚Äôs what we do best)*"
2031,"how does the text response work, actually?"
2032,"i do totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from. my phone does what the watch will do, but better. i don‚Äôt think i will really use it to its full ability, like i do my phone, which is a bit of a waste for me. a good looking watch may end up being a better fit for me, because i don‚Äôt need fitness tracking or sleep detection or anything of the sort. i‚Äôd just be paying for the watch faces, a few games, and a glance or two at the weather per hour. one half of my brain thinks that it‚Äôs totally worth it for such a good deal, the other thinks i‚Äôm an idiot"
2033,Why is it going obsolete in 5 years time?
2034,"i do tend to forget stuff a bunch, so i use reminders pretty frequently. i also like walking and seeing how many steps/calories burned. heart rate stuff is pretty cool as well. i‚Äôm in love with the watch faces though, it‚Äôs the main selling point for me. that and the messaging lol. i‚Äôm seriously considering it thinking about it. if i regret it, it‚Äôll be a nice learning stepping stone."
2035,"i figured. the first week i‚Äôll be infatuated with the features and stuff, then it‚Äôll become a handy *(dad pun intended)* extension of my phone. i‚Äôm still debating but when push comes to shove i‚Äôll get it probably. if i‚Äôm not a fan, i‚Äôll resell it."
2036,And man do I have some nice watchfaces to choose from!
2037,"i cannot count on my fingers how many times i thought i lost my phone, and it was on the counter."
2038,"how long does the battery last? also how are the rings, and how do they motivate youv"
2039,this is probably what i‚Äôm gonna do. i am in the ecosystem although my dog ate one of my airpods. if i get the watch all i‚Äôm missing is a mac. i will make it my mission to use it every single day though
2040,didn‚Äôt even think about resell value; it can‚Äôt go down from 190 right?
2041,"i think it would be very life changing to me as well..if i had that much utility for it. i don‚Äôt think my life is nearly as jam packed as yours. i could use a calculator during class, walk down the halls to close a ring, or respond to my friends but that‚Äôs about it. all that being said, i‚Äôm still conflicted. i‚Äôm leaning towards it ngl haha"
2042,"what are your favorite things about it, and what is it lacking?"
2043,"my only gripe is only a few things will really be useful. reminders, the watch itself, closing rings, sleep, and notifications. that being said i still
it‚Äôs worth it. if i‚Äôm not a fan, just resale"
2044,"@KviingK, I‚Äôm not able to directly reply due to the iOS bug.  I basically laid out the reasons why I like it.  The FitBit might do everything you want cheaper (and you only charge jt once a week)  I basically did the same thing, I bought the cheapest one available at the time from Amazon and figured if I didn‚Äôt like it after 30 days I‚Äôd return it.  I like it enough I‚Äôm considering upgrading during this cycle."
2045,"ahhh all these comments are starting to seem so convincing. everyone is saying how it improved their day to day in all aspects whilst looking cool and fashionable. this is a random question, but can i bring it into the shower, or should i just leave it out?"
2046,"i‚Äôm thinking it could help a lot too. i want to shed a bit of extra weight, so closing that move ring could be very invigorating as well. i don‚Äôt have any home-operated devices or anything like that, but i feel like it could be really helpful organizing for school like you said. especially the sleep part, which i suck at."
2047,"hey, i also plan on pursing software engineering! i want to be a front end or back end (full stack maybe) web dev. this is a little off topic, but would you recommend mac or windows for coding?"
2048,compliments? which watch faces do you use?
2049,i started this thread with my 12 haha. if i didn‚Äôt have a iphone though i wouldn‚Äôt even be here
2050,15 pounds of vegan poop being burned provides 112748.46 BTU.
2051,"i would like to get back into my exercise too not gonna lie. i‚Äôm hoping that this can also motivate me to get back active. the more i hear about it, the more closing rings, monitoring heart rates, and sleep rates all of that is seeming really useful"
2052,"i was into fitness before i got a summer job, i‚Äôm looking to get back into it, i think this is a great way. my g-shock that i‚Äôve had for at least 7 years finally died on me, it was a good watch. i do think i need a upgrade though"
2053,"i won‚Äôt need the 4G model, but this is my biggest fear. of course, i could resell it, but it‚Äôs a hassle. i don‚Äôt want it to eventually end up tossed in a drawer. i think if you don‚Äôt have a jam packed workout filled schedule then it‚Äôs no more than a fancy watch with customizable screens. despite that, i‚Äôm still somewhat interested"
2054,"apple pay is accepted at most mainline places. it has gotten really prominent over quarantine due to tap to pay. i don‚Äôt know how much it will be used, i want to start working out again though. i know $190 is a little less than half off and that‚Äôs a steal"
2055,This is exactly why I'm considering an Apple Watch right now. Also in Europe and the constant mask wearing makes Apple Pay so annoying or just checking my phone in public in general. It's either that or going to Android for touch ID.
2056,Yes!
2057,"I love Apple Maps. And using it on Apple CarPlay is great ‚Äî I have no need of others, so no idea if they work or not."
2058,"While voice to text is useful, depending on where you live and the laws around new drivers and using electronics while driving, I would STRONGLY suggest using do not disturb while driving feature. In our area new drivers can‚Äôt have a moving violation (ticket) for 2 years or it‚Äôs an automatic suspension for 3-6 months and smart watches are in a grey area regarding the use of electronic devices while driving. The law is vague and if the cop is in a shitty mood, interacting with the watch in any way could be considered ticketable. (Your area may be different.)

My kid is going to be driving soon as well and I‚Äôve had this conversation with him already. Unless it‚Äôs an emergency, a reply can wait until you arrive or pull over. 

(I am aware this is an unpopular opinion and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old‚Äú or whatever. I just don‚Äôt believe that a potential 3-6 month license suspension is worth it for a text message.)"
2059,"My watch didn‚Äôt cost that much! Fitbit will tell you but you can‚Äôt respond, or answer the phone (you can talk with someone via watch) and it tracks fitness in much more depth. I check the weather, initiate calls and texts, pay for things w Apple Pay all from my wrist. It‚Äôs become essential to me (I have mobility issues). But it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs thing ‚Äî I get that."
2060,The ECG feature. :)
2061,"16.  i have other money, but i‚Äôve been saving up for the watch for a while. now that i finally have the cash, i‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs seriously worth it"
2062,"i‚Äôll reply to your comment and make an update later (when i get home!)

spoiler alert..it‚Äôs not very good"
2063,I lost 45 pounds since I bought mine. I bought it for the fitness and health aspects. I love my series 6.   Might even upgrade to the 7 if it‚Äôs got enough new goodies.
2064,"I know exactly how it be lol. Think about it, not for the brand. Think about it for what it will do for you and is it really worth it for you to get it now. It's a big purchase, use this as a learning step, just because you're a teenager doesn't mean you need to make stupid decisions. Other than that hope you can make the decision that makes you happy."
2065,"There is no standard keyboard but you can reply to messages using handwriting (not ideal for longer texts as you have to go one letter at a time and let it register), speech to text, emojis, and stickers."
2066,[deleted]
2067,Yes! Lol you get me
2068,"The short version: you don‚Äôt need this thing whatsoever. However, it‚Äôs pretty convenient and fun, maybe slightly motivating, if you want to treat yourself. But don‚Äôt fool yourself into thinking this is a necessity. 

the battery is okay. It will last about 18-20 hours. 

I don‚Äôt really care about the rings, except for calorie burn which is about +\- 10% accurate. 

The watch is highly capable (heart rate monitor, gps, compass, elevation detection, calorie calculator). But you will get the most out of the watch if you use an app dedicated to the activity you want to track. For me that‚Äôs Nike run club and Dawn Patrol. 

The other added bonus is being able to go running without my phone and still listen to music with my AirPods. 

Hope this helps and I hope you end up using your money in a way that will make you happy and healthy :)"
2069,I wouldn‚Äôt think so. $190 is already a great price. I sold my series 5 aluminum that had some surface scratches when it was a year old for $325.
2070,My series 3 was 2 years old and sold for over $200.
2071,"Umm, except for me being not 22 and not being able to use the ECG function, I don‚Äôt really have any complaints!"
2072,"the cheapest fitbit i see is at least $90. i think for that price i‚Äôd just go the extra mile. if you could grab me a link, i‚Äôll check it out. like i said though, at that price i‚Äôll just grab a apple wtch."
2073,"You shouldn't bring it into the shower, bc although it is water resistant and you can swim with it (even in salt water) it shouldn‚Äôt be in contact with soaps. You can read more about this here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205000"
2074,"I walk 3 miles everyday. And at home, I dance using the Xbox Just Dance game. I don't have equipment at home either ... but I make it work! :) 

Have fun and good luck in school!!!"
2075,Mac! It is unix based and has an amazing command line
2076,I‚Äôm using the infograph watch face but what really gets the compliments is that I have a 44mm watch so everyone compliments on the size.
2077,Apple Maps has gotten so much better than Google maps as well!
2078,"It‚Äôs normal feeling. I would say ‚Ç¨190 it‚Äôs worth trying. If you run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI would say just go with it.

If already the sport thing is missing in your life and you have no intention to start it, I would say to leave (just cause you said that every dollar counts). In fact ‚Ç¨190 for a brand new is a deal you won‚Äôt find again"
2079,Oh no!!
2080,Besides the new design and possibly slightly bigger display reports show it won‚Äôt be much different. Series 8 is when we may see newer health and fitness related features.
2081,"if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what can i invest it into? i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs legally much i can do at my age now. i‚Äôd be down to invest, however"
2082,"honestly, i know i don‚Äôt need it. but up until now, most of my money has been towards savings and things i really need. i want to finally treat myself, but i don‚Äôt know if this is the right treat.

the calorie calculator, and nike run club sound excellent though. does nike run have the little complications?

also this is a huge plus. running with my phone in my hand is a hassle, and it slows me down. most of my shorts don‚Äôt have pockets so it‚Äôs pretty annoying. do you think it would work with my beats studio 3 the same way? they both have that apple chip"
2083,"oh okay, thanks. what if a bit of soap gets up there when washing hands?"
2084,"sorry for the SUPER late reply

so far‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs not great. i‚Äôve benched it already lol. it‚Äôs just not useful in my daily life :/ . it‚Äôs a cool addition; i‚Äôm going to wear it tomorrow to a formal event, other than that it provides no additional utility. i have started to excerise more, so hopefully I will get back into using it. otherwise, it‚Äôs face down on my dresser, dead. for me, charging it isn‚Äôt even worth the effort. i wish i would have saved my money kinda; i could really use it right now. i‚Äôll probably never buy another one unless they completely revamp the watch."
2085,[deleted]
2086,"I haven't had any problems with that, I guess the problem is if you like submerge it in soap or soapy water."
2087,"Thanks for the update, I just got rid of my fitbit and was thinking about apple watch. Quite honestly its only the fitness tracking that was interesting but not sure if its worth the price tag."
2088,What‚Äôs the SUPER SUPER late reply?
2089,"i‚Äôm already doing a sort of process like this. i usually put 70% of any earnings i make into my savings under my parents roth ira. the money i‚Äôm gonna use to buy this watch with has been saved up for a while, now that i finally have enough though, i‚Äôm finally wondering if it‚Äôs worth it. if i could use the recreational cash in a better way. seriously thanks for the tips and advice though"
2090,"Don‚Äòt get a series 3. just don‚Äòt. Outdated, updates are pita, not worth it. 

Go for s5 or higher. Compare what they can or can‚Äòt at apple.com and decide to your needs.

Aw with gps only requires iphone with you, the cell can do calls, update information (weather and stuff) on it‚Äòs own. 
I have my iphone wit/ me all time, so the s6 gps was the best deal for me.  Ymmv."
2091,"get the series 6 if you can afford it. if not then get the SE. 

do not get a series 3. outdated design, hard to update, can't run faces/complications that have come out since the series 4, and doesn't play well with the current watch OS."
2092,"I have a 3 and will upgrade as soon as the new watches come out in September. My processor is slow.  Frankly, if I couldn‚Äôt afford more than this, I‚Äôd be looking at Timex or Casio"
2093,"Don‚Äôt get the S3, it‚Äôs outdated and will stop being supported soon. You can get a refurbished Series 5 for $220-$300, which is what I‚Äôd recommend, or an SE if you want new."
2094,"If your heart is set on an S3 then get the cellular even if you are not planning using cellular capability. This model has enough memory to update without going through all the shenanigans necessary with the GPS model. But, as the others are saying, you will miss out on so many features available in the newer watches. If price is your pain point buy an S5 from swappa.com."
2095,Thank you for your input!
2096,Thank you for your input!
2097,I suppose it‚Äôs likely that the price of the older models will go down once the new model is released. Maybe I‚Äôll wait until September‚Ä¶
2098,"Thank you for your input! Sounds like if I want a new one, it‚Äôs either the SE or wait until the 7 comes out and get a 6 for cheaper."
2099,sadly the series 3 new is only with GPS now
2100,"I was wondering this as well, I wanted to wear my watch like that too. Figure it would be less noticeable when I check it. "
2101,"If it's like most Android Wear watches, the display will frequently activate and destroy the battery. I hope it's not"
2102,"http://superphen.co/2015/04/10/my-apple-watch-in-store-try-on-experience-today/

Sadly the demo reel doesn't flip for wearers of the lefty."
2103,"I've seen a pic with it on someone's right wrist, but he didn't flip it.  Supposedly, there is a setting to flip it if you want the crown on the left."
2104,"Out of curiosity, why do you do that? Not an apple watch buyer, but an avid traditional watch wearer. Just curious."
2105,"Heh - you'd figure if it were that big of an issue with the competition, they'd make some effort to address it?"
2106,"It's less effort to slightly twist my left arm to the left than it is to turn a full 90 degrees to the right and posh my elbow out. It's quicker and easier to check the time while running, typing, or standing having a conversation. I can do pushups without the buttons on the edge of the watch being mistakenly pressed by the top of my hand.

I'm also in the National Guard, and it's easier to see the watchface while holding a rifle or notepad (or sneaking a look when I'm supposed to be standing at attention)."
2107,"I did order the wrong size solo loop but that‚Äôs on me, not Apple. Luckily like many of you, I have a collection of other bands."
2108,Any reason you‚Äôre using an S0 for sleep? They‚Äôre pretty bulky and not particularly good at sleep tracking.
2109,My series 6 lasts 2 days and at the end of exactly 2 days since last charge it‚Äôs at about 10% or under and at the end of one full day it‚Äôs at 60% so the series 7 is quite an upgrade in battery life
2110,"Note that first day usage may be skewed a bit because you're likely using it more than normal setting it up.

It drained super fast on my first drain because I spent a lot of time messing with settings but now drain is reasonable even with AOD."
2111,I believe you can also return just the band if your inside the return window of or and get the right size one
2112,"As of last week, I‚Äôve retired it, using my S4 for sleep now.
I mostly like using the watch at night for alarms and not having a separate clock. 
I‚Äôve used some sleep tracking in the past. It‚Äôs interesting, but it didn‚Äôt get me to change anything so stopped paying attention to the data."
2113,"Agreed. Though in my case, my results were for my first FULL day, not ‚Äúthe day I got it and tested everything I could‚Äù. Regardless, I‚Äôm very happy with both results and since I‚Äôm used to not having always on display, I may keep it off just to boost battery."
2114,Thanks. I ordered online (too far from a store) but I‚Äôll check it out. Appreciated.
2115,"A separate clock would probably be better though, it‚Äôs a small screen that‚Äôs not good at being a clock either. 

The data gathered on my devices don‚Äôt really help me either, I only care if there‚Äôs a problem, track it, figure it out and then stop having a use for them. It‚Äôs even known to cause more anxiety for some people. 

The watch was supposed to make things less complicated it it often gives me more problems. I mostly solved them by having a portable charger, a case, and then just replacing the whole thing with a cheap fitness tracker I charge every month or so. The new one seems like it‚Äôs less battery worries though."
2116,I used a s1 for sleep. Tracking movement and heart rate helps me understand stress levels pretty well actually. Tracking my resting heart rate during sleep is a pretty reasonable proxy for stress/relaxation
2117,How do you use the data to help yourself? I don‚Äôt know how to use it.
2118,"I just find it interesting. I learned my resting heart rate is WAY lower after an evening workout.  It was much less stable (I probably was restless) after drinking a fair bit. 

Not earth shattering, but good insight.  Made me feel more in touch with how I felt throughout the day when it was linked to metrics."
2119,"Once you know this, what is the purpose of gathering more data? I agree learning it is useful but when is the more data useful? What do you gain from more data?

I found out what helps me sleep and what bothers me, and heart rate during activity but after learning it, it didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to gather more data and it didn‚Äôt give me an incentive for continuing."
2120,Validated what I decided. Me gusta
2121,"Oh wow.  It looks like all the colors described and depends on the light and contextual background

2122,Tbh I‚Äôm glad I cancelled and ordered Graphite SS. It‚Äôs better than I expected though.
2123,Looks so good I‚Äôm super excited! At first I was disappointed by there not being gold aluminium this year but I think this starlight colour is actually a lot prettier and more classy and versatile than the previous copperish gold.
2124,Honestly looks better and classier than the toy looking silver aluminum
2125,more of a creamy color than gold ish
2126,God this makes me so excite! Can‚Äôt wait
2127,I have a starlight iPad mini and it‚Äôs gorgeous.
2128,ceramic white died for this
2129,"Love the color! When they announced watch 7 I was disappointed they got rid of gold, but I think I like starlight lot more than gold. Can't wait to get mine."
2130,Manged to find any of the BLUE?
2131,"I like it but‚Ä¶I use the Modern Buckle bands and they are a true silver/shiny chrome and it won‚Äôt match. Which means buying stainless‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs not enough of an upgrade to do that yet. Current S4 silver aluminum (brushed silver, but still a better match)."
2132,My fav color so far.
2133,This color convinced me to order a new Apple Watch. Love that it looks kind of taupe. Very easy to dress up and down
2134,"Here‚Äôs a review of the Starlight. 

https://youtu.be/lmcul0YSyik"
2135,Looks almost similar to the ceramic in the photos. I like it!
2136,Starlight is the sleeper hit color IMO. No one seems to have wanted it but I think people are coming aroiund on it.
2137,This reminds me of the ‚ÄúChampagne‚Äù colors that cars get.
2138,"It‚Äôs pretty, but clashes with a lot of the bands I own."
2139,How is that Starlight in Mickey Mouse image? What kind of lighting was going on in that photo?
2140,Glad I decided on Starlight.
2141,"Preference-wise I prefer the neutral colour of its predecessor the silver. The starlight hue is too warm. I can imagine a lot of my bands won't look well with starlight. especially the whiter ones.   


Fingers crossed v8 brings back silver."
2142,"Looks very very feminine, like warm girly pinkish cream that is used to make purses"
2143,"'Like faded gold plastic, or sun-baked semen'.

\- Worst color lineup ever."
2144,Is it just chalk pink ?
2145,This reminds me of a wedding I attended where the color theme included taupe. This is taupe.
2146,"kinda looks like ceramic/titanium, I was beginning to have second thoughts on ordering it until I saw it"
2147,What color band in the bottom right picture if you don‚Äôt mind?
2148,I'm curious do people try to match their apple watch with their iPhone color or don't care?
2149,Obsessed üòç
2150,ALL THE YESSSSS‚Äô üòçüòçüòç
2151,second row far right. what watch face is that to get the little number?
2152,It almost looks like a ceramic model in some lighting conditions. Not my thing but still neat.
2153,It looks beautiful!
2154,Love it.  I can‚Äôt wait to get ahold of one of these S7 tomorrow.  I missed out on pre-order but waking up very early to order online if it‚Äôs available for pickup or go to Apple Store to lines up.
2155,I preordered the 45mm in starlight and it should arrive tomorrow!  I was very nervous to go from gold to starlight but I‚Äôm getting more excited about it!
2156,"Found the starlight available today at an Ô£ø store but in the Nike version.  I then ordered the Ô£ø starlight sport band at Amazon which arrives tomorrow. Wasn‚Äôt planning on getting the Nike version but figured if I don‚Äôt like the band I can exchange it, & the price for the watch was no different than the regular version."
2157,Is the starlight on the AW7 the same on the iPhone 13 aluminum sides?
2158,"Looks nice, as do series 4-6. Apple is slapping in minor hardware upgrades without actually doing much."
2159,Do you want monochromatic colors? Pay for the steel version üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2160,I went with midnight but now am having second thoughts.  Me encanta
2161,I like these weird subtle colours Apple have been doing. I‚Äôve got the ‚Äòwhite‚Äô iPhone 12 and this thing has champagne rails and a back that has red undertones in the right light. It‚Äôs really pretty.
2162,Right?! My exact thought.
2163,There's a YouTube review here: https://youtu.be/k3mLnzWrN7Y
2164,"I‚Äôm looking for blue reviews too, ideally on YouTube to see how it looks in different light or at different angles. Not found any yet.

Edit: https://youtu.be/HZJrnBIxxyw"
2165,"Hey, found some video of the blue. Looks niiiiice.

https://youtu.be/HZJrnBIxxyw"
2166,"Here‚Äôs another one:

2167,"Aaaaand, here‚Äôs a proper one, well-lit and comparing it to the blue iPhone, if you have one of those‚Ä¶

https://youtu.be/Kt_YSXPEI3k"
2168,One reviewer had starlight with a modern buckle and it was nice. https://youtu.be/7jcoYguxoDA
2169,How do you dress it up? I‚Äôm having trouble justifying this one because lots of times in concerts or theatre I wear all black and I don‚Äôt want a white band to stick out
2170,Which colours do you feel it would clash with?
2171,is that supposed to be a bad thing?
2172,"Not sure why you're being downvoted for an opinion. It doesn't look feminine per se, but it definitely has a pinkish hue to it in certain light. But so did some versions of gold in the past."
2173,Looks like starlight is the color of the band and the watch
2174,"Some match, some don‚Äôt. I personally don‚Äôt ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2175,I'd say the bigger screen and fast charge are two very nice additions.
2176,"Same, but I'm sure once it arrives it'll be whatever"
2177,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O2Lw8E4f9CY
2178,I don‚Äôt speak Korean but that blue color is mmmm *chefs kiss*
2179,Thanks!
2180,"I now have the Blue S7 watch, so I can make all the comparisons I need :p thanks!"
2181,"I love him ‚Äî he‚Äôs my new best friend. No idea why, just a relaxing presentation from a sharp dresser!"
2182,"Trying out the starlight case with some dark bands on watch studio, I feel like the starlight colour gives a nice albeit subtle contrast to dark bands. I think it gives an interesting pop which isn‚Äôt too tacky or overpowering. On the other hand, midnight would be a safer choice when wearing dark bands but in my opinion it ends up being a bit monotonous and not as striking as starlight with a dark band

I personally wouldn‚Äôt get the starlight with a light coloured band. I feel like it would stand out too much with dark outfits"
2183,"For example, my favorite band is the stainless steel Milanese.  The silver aluminum, even though it is matte, looks really good with it, but starlight, which trends warm, wouldn‚Äôt look right.  Could I just deal with it , and would anyone else notice, probably not, but as something I wear almost every day it would bug me.  I also think Starlight wouldn‚Äôt look good with blue and black bands."
2184,"It kinda is, they should have add this color as additional one, not as replacement to silver."
2185,"People who downvote me probably never been in any fashion shop, its very popular color among women [https://sklep-torebki.pl/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/4/1/4151s.jpg](https://sklep-torebki.pl/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/4/1/4151s.jpg)

2186,Yep
2187,lol thanks for that
2188,I‚Äôm jealous. I‚Äôve ordered one but it‚Äôs six weeks until I get it‚Ä¶
2189,"Such a hard decision but ultimately I chose midnight, last watch I had was silver 40mm and I‚Äôm trying the 45mm and going dark we will see if I like it or nit"
2190,I wouldn't mix stainless steel with aluminum though. Starlight matches every actual band color.
2191,Just a heads up‚Ä¶ I just got my starlight 41 and it looks silver to me in most lighting ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2192,"I‚Äôm the same way about ‚Äúmixing metals‚Äù, different lug colours bother me üòÖ Could always try a third party Milanese in starlight? I just ordered a starlight metal link band off Amazon..definitely plan on trying starlight out with black.. I didn‚Äôt find it looked bad in the watch studio, but I feel like watches and colour combos are definitely personal preference"
2193,"You‚Äôre gonna love it when you get it! I really like the new blue colour, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ more blue? I like it!"
2194,Good choice! I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with either colour. Once you start wearing either I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd think much about wanting to change since they both look good in their own ways
2195,When I read your switch. I get the feeling you lost more than you gained ü•¥
2196,"I agree with all of your analysis but I also think a Garmin feature that is never accounted for in these types of comparisons is the awesome tactile buttons. 

As someone that runs in all weather including the frigid cold, being able to start/stop and lap with a physical button was everything. So I wear both :) like a crazy person!"
2197,"The battery just sucks in Apple Watch for me. Not sure why Apple can‚Äôt incorporate the sport training aspect Garmin has. Maybe it‚Äôs a reliability thing? Is Garmin‚Äôs data even accurate or are the numbers on their Watch just fluff? Like body battery, heart rate, or any metric it measures? Then again, how accurate is apples in a lab setting? We are all wearing these devices to get these data points but can the data gathered actually stand up to lab tests?

Small update but I just got the watch, think it was 70% charged when turning it on. Have done couple hour long workouts and never plugged in and still at 12 days of battery. Apple get on this level."
2198,"Good writeup, although I question some of the categories. Weather, 3 points? Really?

Apple makes a better smartwatch, no question. If you want download apps, Siri and proper notifications, etc., its hard to beat.

If you want a real sports watch, Garmin is the better option. The Apple watch is really a toy in comparison. Better than a fitbit, but same target user who values the ""smart"" features more than the sports features. 

GPS is a major Garmin weakness IMO. I had to get a Stryd pod to fix it. That is totally unacceptable.

Garmin body battery is underrated. I look at it regularly, and I don't think Apple has anything like that. It has to be worth a few points. 

Also, a touch screen on a sports watch sucks. After pausing an activity accidentally for the 50th time, you will hate the touch screen. Yes, you can lock it, but that is a PITA too. I would ding Apple 10 points for that."
2199,"It‚Äôs not really a comparison. AW is a smart watch. Fenix isn‚Äôt a smart watch, it‚Äôs more an outdoors watch / fitness watch with some smart watch features"
2200,"I switched this past weekend and I love it. I had my series 3 since launch. The AW provided things I simply don‚Äôt need or want anymore. 
I‚Äôm very happy with the fenix 6. I‚Äôm a cyclist and the fact it works with power meters is huge. 
I was also surprised how comfortable the fenix is. I figured as a bigger watch id lose some comfort but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more comfortable than the AW."
2201,I really like having Body Battery and find that it is a very useful training tool. I check my morning HRV using other apps already but I‚Äôve noticed certain behaviors which reduce HRV and sap my battery. I also use Stryd for running and train by power rather than pace. The major benefit of the F√©nix over the Apple Watch for me is the battery life and sleep metrics.
2202,"Garmin fenix 6s pro has best gps I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs so close to certified course distance, when I race that I‚Äôm shocked. I‚Äôve also wheeled short segments like 400,800, and miles for workouts and compared to watch and scary good. I‚Äôve also done track workouts and when the watch is on track mode it‚Äôs super accurate."
2203,"I would add my two cents in for others looking to switch, the experience for notifications changes quite a bit from Android and iOS"
2204,"nice summary, i think AW and fenix aren't direct rivals mostly because they are targeted at different people. But i understand it is a natural dichotomy when looking for a wearable. Of course i agree and disagree with some of the things you say but it is a cool and detailes post which can help someon who is looking for some info before buying!"
2205,If the AW would have 2 or 3 day battery life (or more) I would go back to it in a flash .. charging it every day gets old pretty quick
2206,The running dynamics feature also adds statistics that are good for improving form that Apple simply will never make any money in adding to their watch's feature set.
2207,i have a fenix 6 sapp and the gps accuracy really sucks.
2208,"GPS?? Maybe you have a defective unit or a lemon?? Never ever had an issue with my Garmin's GPS and it's just as accurate as my phone or moreso most of the time.

Also you're reviewing the watch before you're familiar with it and it's clear. You can disable notifications for certain apps and you can even activate a do not disturb mode.

Plus you missed one of the main advantages of Fenix watches over your average smartwatch, their durability. It'll survive much more abuse and look newer after getting roughed up on hiking trails and in the gym.

And if you cared about a digital assistant, you shouldn't have switched to Garmin. Garmin watches are fitness/sports watches with some smart features added, while other watches are wellness smartwatches with fitness features added."
2209,"Nice writeup, very balanced.

You might want to give Accuweater Minutecast a look as a replacement for your 2 hour weather widget:

[https://apps.garmin.com/en-GB/apps/c1facb1f-db5a-4352-adf3-9dd09e6fc668](https://apps.garmin.com/en-GB/apps/c1facb1f-db5a-4352-adf3-9dd09e6fc668)

Reviews are mixed but I think many of the low ones are old... I've found it pretty great since getting my Fenix a few months ago."
2210,Having to charge the AW every night or every other night is a deal breaker for me. They could add all the features in the world but if I don't get the same battery as a Garmin it pointless to me. Can't count the amount of times my wife gets up and ready to head to work and can't take her watch cause she forgot to charge it.
2211,"I‚Äôm literally doing the same comparison right now. I just worth the fenix 5 for a week last week and I‚Äôm wearing my Apple Watch this week to compare. My 2 biggest takeaways so far are battery life difference, obviously. And being able to do a quick text back is very nice on the Apple Watch. I‚Äôm just not sure I can deal with charging my AW daily compared to getting 7 days on the garmin."
2212,"Thanks for all of this insight.  Currently on an AW4, it currently serves my needs but whenever the Fenix 7 comes out I will consider making the change.  The ability to use it as a cycling headunit, golf gps, as well as battery for long hikes and runs all appeals to me as I won't need to worry about charging for weekend trips.      

I feel like I may miss the ease of use of responding to texts etc on my watch... but hopefully after a while I will forget I even had that option."
2213,"For more accuracy in GPS, try turning on GLONASS."
2214,">**Good quality GPS: -8pts**  
‚Ä¶this is an algorithm problem, because after parsing FIT file in Google Maps, you get correct distance. Strava can fix it in one click for free.‚Ä¶

What is this one click you speak of? Or is it automatic?"
2215,Thank you for the review I have been going back and forth between AW6 & Fenix 6 for some time now and this helps a little. I'm currently leaning toward the AW because of the heart monitoring with Afib.
2216,[deleted]
2217,"Well, there are certainly things I miss, but overall I am very happy and would do it again. Almost all of downsides are just conveniency issues: I have to take my phone with me, I have to get up and check the weather, I have to get up and see the notification etc. Basically everything beside poor GPS in the forest.

On the other hand, Garmin is adding the value. Garmin Coach, Training Status or good battery is something you **can't have** on your wrist with AW."
2218,Good point! I have it too short to notice it.
2219,"What gear do you recommend for cold weather?  I need to run again and if I don't start while the bug is in me I man never get it again.  Northern IL can be a cruel mistress in the winter, though.  

I ran in the Army, but it never got that cold in southern GA.  I've grown soft, I know."
2220,"I just screamed when I read this.   
I'd do the same as I'm an avid apple fanboy, but damn... these new Fenix and Epic watches are something. 

My activity is mostly cycling and hiit training; I think I will give it a try after having AW0, AW3 and AW4."
2221,"For me, the body battery metric on the latest firmware is absolutely spot on. I‚Äôm really impressed with it as a metric - though I don‚Äôt necessarily use the information as a tool. It simply validates the way I‚Äôm feeling (which I suppose is a form of bias). 

Same with the sleep metrics."
2222,"I find measurements from AW and Fenix pretty similar, including calories, VO2max, HR max, HRrest and so on. There are differences, but these are couple % differences.

I guess that number of people who really care about this kind of measurements is preety small (and they all use proper sport watches), the majority of people is just fine with closing rings and Training Status is something that would mostly de-motivate them ;)

I'd love to see Apple Watch Garmin Edition instead of Nike edition - that would be best watch ever."
2223,[deleted]
2224,"Please remember these are my subjective observations. I wasn't trying to be objective and weight the points to match their real value, I rated my feeling about them. And weather was something I liked and used, so yes, -3 points :)

Body battery wasn't mentioned as I am comparing my watch - Fenix 5 - and BB was introduced on Fenix 6.

I also never stopped an activity on AW by mistake."
2225,"Just the response I was looking for. The AW touchscreen blows for running. In the summer, my sweaty paws can't swipe. In the winter, my sleeve rubbing against the screen will cause it to do something crazy. It's really annoying when you are finishing up a run and look down to see your AW workout paused."
2226,"It‚Äôs really interesting how threads can get biased by an early comment. Not biased as in you are sharing incorrect info, but you shared your experiences and get upvoted and it just steamrolls.

I don‚Äôt have firsthand experience, but could it be that y‚Äôall are just talking about the fenix 5? I‚Äôm in the market for a fenix and decided to wait for a 7, but all the reviews I saw on YouTube and a few I read online mentioned how the fenix 6 vs AW 6 gps battle went to the garmin. They described them as being close enough, but that the garmin got signal faster and didn‚Äôt cut off corners like the Apple Watch did.

Even in my experience with fianc√©‚Äôs fenix 5 and my vivosport, the distances are never off Google maps or a car odometer by more than .05 miles."
2227,"This was also surprising for me. I expected Fenix 5 will be a lot more noticeable on my wrist, but I can't really see a difference (I had AW 44mm).

It is also a lot prettier for me, but it is so subjective I decided not to include this point."
2228,"Do you feel like body battery is a nocebo/placebo affect?  Like do you change your programing based on body battery? 

In weight lifting we use RPE scales or ""perceived effort "" and adjust accordingly."
2229,Have you tested it in the forest or next to high buildings? What is your running pace?
2230,"That's true, on iOS the features are very basic thanks to closed API on notifications, probably to make sure no one can compete with AW on this ground.On Android notifications API is accessible, so the possible features are very similar to what AW offers.

In other words, this feature sucks on iOS thanks to Apple. I haven't mentioned it, because I figured that Android users won't be interested in switching from Apple Watch :)"
2231,"I think many people will consider switching if they are not satisfied with something and the time for new watch will come. I think it will work both ways. I was dissatisfied with battery life and sport features and lost hope now seeing that everything Apple managed to add with iOS15/WatchOS8 in this area was auto-pause on Cycling activity and Pilates.

You are more than welcome to disagree with me - it is my subjective opinion based on my use cases and my needs. The idea of this post was to help others to decide (I bet it will be high in Google), so the more constructive opinions it has the better it becomes."
2232,"I don't have a defective unit. It is a known bug and it was reported to Garmin multiple times by a lot of users. The problem is caused by a metal bezel (FR has plastic one and no issues) combined with Garmin algorithm to exclude data points with weak GPS signal if they are too close to previous registered point. It prevents counting weak signal-caused floating counted as a movement. Problem is arising when you are a slow runner **and** running in the forest or near high buildings. Your slow pace makes even a correct readout as a floating and discarding it. Result: wrong distance & pace. Garmin should adapt this algorithm to account units with weaker signal by design. It never happened.

As you see, I got pretty familiar with Fenix and did some research.

You can't disable notifications for specific apps on iOS. You can on Android. This post is dedicated for iOS users as it compares Apple Watch with Fenix and I marked in this point of my review I am writing about iOS.

I haven't missed durability, because I have never had an issue with AW or Fenix. I think you are missing the point of my post, which is MY opinion and MY observations. Subjective, not objective, fully-featured review of both units."
2233,"The description says it is not available in my country, but I installed it and it works - I'll test it, thank you!"
2234,"There was a rumored Explorer Edition, with proper battery and hardened case, but sadly it never showed up."
2235,"It was a 'nice to have' feature for me I am not missing at all. I have phone near me almost all of the time, so basically it is a matter of few steps or taking it out from my pocket - not that convenient, but that's it.   
What I miss is Siri, as I could ask her to do something when I am actually doing something absorbing (like cooking) and my hands are busy or dirty. It worked fine. The workaround for me is to have phone near and ask Siri on the phone, but this is much less convenient."
2236,"It's enabled, I also tried Galileo."
2237,"From left sidebar -> 3 dots menu -> Correct distance. Formally, it is 2 clicks: https://imgur.com/a/2UmlubK"
2238,"This is the reason I included ""Who am I"" paragraph with short description what activities I do. Everyone may compare how it fits their lifestyle. Former AW user and amateur runner's insight will be unhelpful to a professional runner or a commando and vice versa."
2239,"I guess AW is a smartwatch first and a sports watch second.  Whereas the Fenix is a sports watch first and a smartwatch 3rd (yes, that was on purpose).  If you want a great smartwatch don't get a Garmin and vice versa.

I moved from a Samsung Galaxy Watch to the Fenix 6x pro.  I made the switch as I wanted more for fitness related stuff.  And I wanted maps on the go.  And better battery life (although, Samsung is better than AW in that department as I used to get 4-days on the Samsung).  I couldn't really care less about the lack of smart watch functionality on the Fenix as it does enough for me (I get notifications and I can quick reply but need to use my phone for more functionality which is fine).

With regards to the GPS.  I have also read that the GPS tracking isn't that great.  Maybe because I'm not an elite athlete, but for me, what is more important, is consistency.  If my Fenix is under/over calculating distance then I'm ok with that providing as it's consistenly under/over calcualting it.  That way, I can see improvements.  If my 10km run is really 10.5km then the distance doesn't matter (for me) as long as it always says 10km and I can see improvements to my time.

Good review btw."
2240,"Go for it mate.  Ex-Army here (24-years).  Left in 2013.  Served in NI (don't live there though).  I'm 51 and carrying a few injuries (more niggles really) that have prevented me from running for the last 2-years.  

Watching the Olympics motivated me to get off my fat arse and start running again.  Started back in early August and I'm now seeing the improvements.  I get up at 5AM, which I used to do anyway before I started running again, and I'm running 10KM 3 days a week and 10km walks a day the rest of the week.  It's starting to get cold in the mornings (not Canada cold though) and dark.  Whilst it's not too cold I would suggest getting out now before the weather really changes and then becomes an excuse not to do anything.

For context, back in my Army days, I would easily push out 6 min miles over half marathon distances.  When I started running again I could barely jog and was doing 13-min miles.  I've completed my 10km run this morning and I got a 10-km record which averaged at 10:13 min miles.  

Get out now and get the bug for it before the weather changes (and it gets darker!!)."
2241,"Haha I‚Äôm not sure I have the best gear but a good breathable light winter jacket, a headlamp, light mitts, and I use a fleece buff to cover my face when it gets real bad (I‚Äôm in Ottawa, Canada)."
2242,"I have the 6 as well. It is fine, unless you are around buildings or trees, when it can be markedly off. Realtime pace is almost useless for running too, and that is GPS based."
2243,"must be a difference with the weather apps between the F6 & the F5, as with my F6 with the built in weather widget I get current details, then press down and I get a 4 hour future trend from current time, then press again to get a 4 day future trend, then press again to get 12hr future graph of temperature and rain percentage.

For me the biggest issue is the API on the weather which is nearest weather station (fortunately mine is only 8miles away), rather than doing it via direct location and using a source like Weather Channel etc. But if your nearest one was 100miles or so away (which some people have) it wouldn't be of much asssistance."
2244,"Take a look at [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminFenix/comments/ptsv2p/switching_from_apple_watch_to_garmin_fenix_my/hdynqm8/) what causes the GPS problem.

GPS is ok when the signal is good or you are moving fast enough. More, the GPS signal is good enough itself, the problem lies in Garmin's algorithm to exclude data points with weaker data points. After parsing raw data from the watch in external software you get correct results.  
I pointed it out as it directly affects my use: I am a slow runner (6 min/km is a race pace for me) and I am running in the forest."
2245,"My experience is with the Fenix 6 and it is not unusually based on what I have read online and on Reddit.

I do think it depends on where you (which satellites networks are available) and what kind of access the watch has to the sky (buildings, trees etc).

It also depends what you are using GPS for. Most of the YouTube videos I‚Äôve see focus on comparing the GPS tracks between the watches and the distance recorded at the end of the activity. My experience with Garmin has been OK from that perspective although there was a software upgrade about 6 months ago that screwed it up. I use the Fenix 6 for hiking/trail running navigation and it is great.

My real issue with GPS on Garmin is that it is virtually useless for real-time pace calculation. Probably more to do with how they are processing GPS data rather than the GPS chip itself. Whatever the reason, it‚Äôs pretty hopeless.

Some others have noted that the forerunner is markedly than the Fenix in this regard. I‚Äôve never had a forerunner so I don‚Äôt know if this is true or not."
2246,Fenix 5 owner here. I have the same GPS issues and it drives me crazy at times. Otherwise I love the watch.
2247,Which country would that be if you dont mind me asking
2248,Awesome
2249,"Thank you.

Same error is obviously good enough if you train for yourself (like I do), but getting consistent readout is also a hard thing: GPS signal strength varies if there are dense clouds, so on that days you might get different distance (and pace as a consequence). Autumn comes where I live, trees are starting to loose leaves so I expect I'll get better distance and pace (on the same route) :)"
2250,"Oh yeah that‚Äôs pretty interesting. I can see why they made the algo do that‚Ä¶ but it definitely is obvious how it would affect runners like you (and me!). Maybe we haven‚Äôt hit that issue because even though we‚Äôre slow, generally we are running on straight roads outside clear of any overhead environment so disregarded floating points wouldn‚Äôt make much of a difference."

Nice post OP."
2253,Thank you
2254,It‚Äôs really a fitness and productivity machine. It‚Äôs built for your well-being and fitness goals and also making quick reply‚Äôs and quick notifications easier to accomplish. So if you aren‚Äôt using it to streamline your work emails and calendars or to improve your health metrics tracking goals you won‚Äôt get much from it besides a pretty way to see the time.
2255,I‚Äôve never heard smart watches pitched as divorcing you from your phone. Maybe just saving some battery. It‚Äôs also like a watch so it‚Äôs like a fashion statement which is like the only point of the higher-end models like you bought. I use mine a lot for the Home app and flashlight and mainly it lets you see if a notification is dumb or actually worth taking your phone out. I hear a lot of people like them for the alarm because it just taps you on the wrist. Mainly I feel like you paid more and expected more tech but you actually just got more fashion.
2256,"These smart watches will not separate you from your phone. Maybe a Saturday afternoon you can leave the phone behind for a few hours, but don‚Äôt kid yourself thinking you‚Äôll go days relying on your watch while you decrease your screen time. 

You hit the nail on the head, it integrates seamlessly with the Apple garden. And once you start to build the garden walls high enough, that‚Äôs when the watch, airtag, tv, HomeKit, etc becomes worth it. 

Homekit alone will be the main reason for years to come that I‚Äôll continue to upgrade AWs every 2-3 years."
2257,"When i was at the office and when traveling a lot, I found having information and notifications on the wrist was a huge convenience.  However over the last year, working at home, I basically don't need it at all.  I wear it for the time mostly but I keep it in DND mode so all of the notifications alert on the phone.  So it really depends on who you are and how you use it.  One thing I to still appreciate is accepting 2FA for logging in to work.  I must use that at least 10 times a day and I like just tapping the watch to accept.

For the light user the SE or previous year's model is probably a better buy. 

LTE is a waste of money IMO as I have found very few practical use cases for it.  After two years of having it, I disconnected the LTE.

What is worth it is the stainless steel, but only if you plan to keep the watch or four years.  As it is the SS includes LTE anyway, but I would recommend just not paying for LTE (unless one wants to try it for a while to satisfy the curiosity.)  If they had a cheaper SS without LTE, i would recommend THAT one.  The sapphire crystal on my black SS S4 is still pristine (unscratched) unlike how my series 2 got pretty beat up over the two years I had it.  If you want the crystal to stay unscratched, it's worth paying for the SS model (especially the black with the coating.)  If you think you want to upgrade in a couple of years, I would save the money and stick with aluminum or an SE.

I personally don't think I'll upgrade until like series 7?  I just don't think I'll find it worth upgrading until blood glucose is added or my watch dies.  But I am still paying or AC+ so maybe I'll get it ""battery serviced"" and keep going?

I find the ceramic, titanium, and other premium models are probably just throwing money away but they do exist for people who want the splurge or a nice gift.  They are probably intended for people that make a lot more money than me and want premium expensive things.

Apple watch is always hard to justify because it's not a necessity by any means.  I used to run a lot and I thought it was great for tracking my runs.  I'll probably get back into that as it is."
2258,"I'm down 80lbs since I got my watch. Makes logging and tracking fitness and consumption MINDLESS and yes, WORTH EVERY health savings dollar!!!

SOOOO much health data. I have been able to increase my oxygen consumption and improve my walking stride, gate, and pace. Its fun to know more about yourself. 

I got the watch for fitness and health, but end up using it everyday to automate my house lights, fans, and blinds, the watch vibrate on my wrist in the car when I am using CarPlay for directions, I can control my music when walking using the watch and my AirPods.

&#x200B;

Yes! Worth it! But then again, I got my watch Series 5, brand new, through an Amazon deal and paid using my Health Savings Account. The watch was $200. So yes, definitely worth it. I would never ever ever ever pay $1,300 for a watch that's going to get dinged up. 

But its all subjective and personal. 

But without the watch, I might not have lost 80lbs as consistently as I have, so for me, I probably would have paid $1,300 for that because I have saved SOOOOOO much time and money on health care in the long run."
2259,"Received my Apple Watch series 6 as a gift. Have had it for a year now and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd have bought it for myself. It‚Äôs basically a Fitbit on steroids aka activity tracker plus a ton of additional health related products that have no value to me for a much bigger price tag.
For example things like blood oxygen and heart rate tracking aren‚Äôt particularly valuable to me‚Ä¶ I have no idea what my blood oxygen should be or why it‚Äôs important and the app doesn‚Äôt seem to provide much education. The heart rate monitor is unreliable‚Ä¶ it fails to get a clear reading as often as it succeeds so I‚Äôd never feel comfortable relying on it. You can use it to take a picture from your phone‚Ä¶ I do use that on occasion.
Notifications aren‚Äôt all that helpful since voice dictation inevitably has typos, but you can‚Äôt edit them from the watch. Nor can you read the message you dictated before sending so I always end up pulling out my phone to text or to correct whatever I dictated through the watch. Call quality on the watch is patchy.
I like it for running and sometimes I can sync my audible books to the watch and I love not having to take my phone, but out of 3 books I tried to sync only one ever actually downloaded to the watch. Plus it doesn‚Äôt seem to sync with the phone if you do succeed in downloading an audiobook, listen to it on your watch, and then return to the phone you‚Äôll be in a different place than where you left off. 
Couldn‚Äôt say what else it‚Äôs good for since reading anything on it just makes you pull out your phone, you can‚Äôt type on it and the dictation is average at best. I haven‚Äôt tried putting it on my phone plan so can‚Äôt comment if that would improve my experience. Overall it seems like a gimmick product Apple is using to source data for their healthcare projects. 

TL:DR No, it‚Äôs a glorified Fitbit that will have you reaching more frequently for your phone. (Apple Watch 6 Owner for 1+ years)"
2260,"Suppose taking advantage of the fitness goals/functionality is among the least of reasons as to why I‚Äôd ever purchase one? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the work out tracker is kind of handy when I go out and do my long walks and my swimming."
2261,"It only has an 18 hour battery life though, no?  Why wouldn't I use Fitbit or something similar that I only have to charge once a week?  All of the other features my phone already does."
2262,One of the selling features of LTE is to go without your phone and that's an idea a lot of people get a little excited about only to find that for most people it's not usually practical to do so.  I think that's what OP means by divorcing from the phone.
2263,That last sentence I think really sums up how I feel. üòî
2264,"It‚Äôs definitely more than a workout tracking device. Apple Heath can track *everything* down to the length of your stride, the oxygen level of your breathing, the quality of your sleep, the rhythmic pattern of your heart‚Ä¶ and put it into a high quality, trackable data set that you can share with your doctor. Apple Watch is designed at its core to improve your understanding of your health. It‚Äôs the main reason people purchase this device. Beyond the health tracking features, the productivity features are almost a basic given. Complications are a cool way to track many things at once so play around with watch faces to find what gets the most of our if it for you. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a watch. You shouldn‚Äôt even notice it until you‚Äôre supposed to notice it."
2265,You can‚Äôt put it on a charger? It‚Äôs really not that hard‚Ä¶
2266,"Yeah I see people use it for runs or workouts and that seems like a good use case, but I can‚Äôt imagine it being that useful for much else."
2267,"You may not have made the best purchase for your use case, but at lease apple stuff holds value super well. You could always sell it and buy something that suits your needs better."
2268,Charging a phone is already annoying enough. I can't wrap my head around a watch you have to charge daily. What exactly does an apple watch do that my phone can't? Don't say fitness things as there are much better and cheaper fitness wearables out there.
2269,"Late but using PocketCasts and Apple Music, they auto sync my recently listened to podcasts/music and so I can easily go with just my watch and earphones to the store or out for a bike ride. It's actually really, really nice for that because you don't always want to take a 6.7"" phone out with you, especially in shorts.

Directions via Maps are also really useful without your phone. You can do all of this without even needing the LTE model but of course map data should be looked at before leaving without your phone if you go outside of your local area."
2270,Plugging a phone is‚Ä¶ is annoying? What? You‚Äôre not understanding the product at all here. The idea is that it does the same things your phone does so that you don‚Äôt have to have your phone out. You can keep your phone in your pocket. Obviously. If you just want fitness tracking by all means get a tracker that does only that. If you want a product that is a supplement to your phone and allows you to keep your phone out away in social situations while still being on alert then Apple Watch is the choice. It‚Äôs not for everyone. Definitely not for someone who thinks plugging a phone in is annoying. Seriously‚Ä¶ people these days.
2271,One of the most annoying parts of my phone is all of the notifications.  Now I am also getting them on something attached to my wrist?  Sounds like a nightmare.
2272,"Yeah, this definitely isn‚Äôt for you. Some of us need to stay notified all the time. Even during meetings where it‚Äôs rude to have a phone out, or on the go."
2273,"Thanks for undertaking this. I'me one of the folks that always thought a smartwatch would eventually be the best detox device for me since I'm not concerned with privacy, but looks like it still has a long ways to go. Not to mention the extra phone plan costs which are a recurring expense."
2274,"No problem, thank you for reading :) 

Yes I think it isn‚Äôt there yet. Perhaps one running a meant-to-be-stand-alone OS (like a skinned Android) with a Bluetooth mini QWERTY keyboard would the issues I‚Äôve highlighted. Sort of like a tiny blackberry with a wrist strap. At that point though I would glue one to the other and make a mini BB. But then you could just get a Jellyphone 2 at that point. 

One other consideration that popped up for me a few times is that it‚Äôs your phone on your wrist. If you are going to a formal event, it really stands out and makes you look like a SpyKid. I think most smartwatches will, the displays look too 2D to fool anyone that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äòreal‚Äô watch (even with Always-On). I guess you could take off the straps and keep it in your pocket, but its so little and slippery it will end up flying into someone‚Äôs wine."
2275,"Funny story, a Jelly 2 is what I actually use now üòÇ now I just have to attach it to my wrist."
2276,"Would love to see a fallout pipboy style wrist holder for the jelly2, I know they have the clunky universal one but the jelly 2 is small enough to really make it work"
2277,"Slap it on your wrist, and enjoy it. You‚Äôll get the hang of it sooner  than later"
2278,You will die a bit on the first scratch. But it‚Äôs meant to be used and worn. Have fun.
2279,switch up watch faces regularly. for me it‚Äôs like getting a new watch every week
2280,"Go to Apple Books app and download free 412 page ‚ÄúWatch User Guide‚Äù 8.3
Tons of good info 
Have fun with your new watch!"
2281,"Make sure you have unlock with iPhone on. Settings, passcode. Very small setting, love that I don‚Äôt have to put in the passcode on my watch"
2282,Ping your iPhone from the watch control centre when you cannot find it.
2283,Works better on your wrist.
2284,Get the WorkOutdoors app if you plan of using the watch for exercising outside.
2285,Enjoy it! Pick a few watch faces so you can try them and dial in your favorites. Add apps as you prefer. Explore it!
2286,i‚Äôd grab a case that has a raised bezel on it which will protect the screen a lot.
2287,"If enabled, disable handwashing. Takes a lot of battery and it‚Äôs unnecessary"
2288,Have different watch faces for different uses - home/work/gym etc. Then use Shortcuts to switch faces automatically. I have one that changes my watch face when I arrive at/leave the gym
2289,Get a case or screen protector. Forget what this sub tells you. The protection offered is great.
2290,"Use the shortcuts app on your phone to have your watch do some cool stuff, look it up on YouTube."
2291,"Supposedly having the strongest glass, get a screen protector. I've had every apple watch but the 5 and the 7's glass has scratched the easiest. Have had no scratches on any of my other apple watched."
2292,The silent alarm is the best feature! Your bedmate will thank you
2293,Invest in a screen protector. I dropped my watch from less than 3 ft onto my bathroom floor and shattered the screen.
2294,"Snap on color changing screen protector is 10 bucks on ‚Äòzon. I have the Red 6 44m I am wearing a leather brown wide strap and snap a black cover over it and it now has wicked red highlights under the black. Oh‚Ä¶ diff vibe? Snap on the white one and my Blue/tan sport loop from Apple. Yes they are overpriced but they do fit perfect , dry fast if you get splashed washing dishes or quick swim. Pro tip, don‚Äôt be showering or hot tubbing with it on, but pool water, lakes are fine as long as you enable the water drop icon from the rotating crown applet. Etc

Lastly if you like Twitter I‚Äôve fallen in love with Chirp. I paid for it because it was so good and just works. But you don‚Äôt NEED to if you just read your feeed. If you wanna reply or send new tweets usin your voice that‚Äôs gets really addictive. Realizing whoa, this is way faster than typing. How did I get along like this‚Ä¶.oh sorry I just had a call on my wrist and then replied to my wife on a text and had Siri in her Aussie laddie gal voice do some math for me while typing this up. I was a hater at first, like hardcore cursing Tim Cook et Al for not making a touchscreen MacBook Pro (I was a professional artist for a newspaper it would have helped a fuckload) so I got a Lenovo 4K one instead but still love my iPhone 12pro and my watch 6. Apple lost me in the computer realm. and I was an Apple user and certified apple tech who drove around with a Mac Guy license plate with a Manatee on it in south Florida!! Mac SE till, MacBook Pro 2015. The bursting battery on my 2499.00 dual grafx was the last straw since it blew a month after AppleCare expired.  It‚Äôs as if Apple took their 200B in cash to study just how to get products to be mandatory upgraded just post warranty. ‚Ä¶ we are such marks for apple I swear ‚Ä¶. But I love my stuff to just work. 
Have YOU ever built a Gentoo distri from scratch? Do that once and see how quick you appreciate owning a iDevice (sorry for the extra long rant advice, I‚Äôm old and have a lot of free time now ). Lol. Peace and enjoy the watch. My son loves his 7."
2295,Don‚Äôt let your kids play with it or any kid for that matter.
2296,Get a screen protector! They scratch easily. Mine got scratched after just one month
2297,Download Carrot weather. Turn on snark.
2298,get a screen protector
2299,"LPT : Make it a habit to wear or remove the watch only with some kind of soft surface beneath your arm.

2304,"Get AppleCare. Greatly helps if you drop it or smack it into something, screen protector or not."
2305,"Try changing the siri voice. I‚Äôm a fan of Female Irish.

2307,"I buy a case/screen protector.  I bought for utility, not looks, so ymmv.  $500 piece of hardware and I ain‚Äôt rich like these ‚Äúnaked‚Äù look folks."
2308,Wear the crown on the left low. Way easier to navigate.
2309,Turn off sounds and put haptic feedback on max.
2310,Put a sleek case on it. Forget the naysayers
2311,"Can I just say that‚Äôs the best watch face!! Maybe try it in a full white or grey color, rather than multi-coloured"
2312,"First of all, congrats OP. And for tips, just use it. No tips required."
2313,"Just copy and pasting my comment from a similar post.

Take some time and make a custom watch face, it‚Äôll make the watch so much better. I use the contour watch face and I have it setup to give me all the information I need.

It gives me the time, battery level, chance of rain or snow, what the weather feels like, the date and a TickTick complication so I can easily open the app and view tasks."
2314,If you don‚Äôt mind the notifications I‚Äôd suggest you look into the shortcuts app to automate watch face changes to suit your schedule. I for example have one with my agenda visible when I‚Äôm on working hours so I can track my meetings and a simpler one for the night with some sleep related complications.
2315,There is a flashlight option from the pull up.  This came in handy this week when I was in the bathroom and the power went out at work.
2316,put it on your dominant wrist.
2317,"Congrats! I too just bought my first AW a few weeks ago. First thing first‚Ä¶ Start wearing your watch and stop looking at its beauty on the counter. It looks even more beautiful on your wrist! Haha

If you have any exercise apps writing to the Apple Health app you may want to disable that if you‚Äôre going to be using the watch the track any workouts. I found that when I did any Peloton workouts the peloton app was writing data to the Apple Health app and so was the watch when I started a workout. I was killing my numbers! Once I figured it out (thanks to this sub) I only have the watch writing to it and it‚Äôs no longer counted twice. 

I hope that helps and makes sense. Enjoy!!"
2318,Get a LK screen protector asap at a minimum on amazon. It is invisible and will save you a heartache post on reddit about a scratched face.
2319,Put it on?
2320,"I‚Äôm in the same boat. It‚Äôs extremely convenient. I like having the battery life on display. I always charge mine every night from 8:15 until 9:00ish.

2344,First thing you should do is purchase apple care if you haven‚Äôt. Trust me I learned my lesson with my first Apple Watch. It‚Äôs cheaper or just as much to replace your watch as it is to fix it.

I have one I use specifically for the mornings so that I can see weather (current and upcoming for the day), wind, temperature, sunrise/sunset time so that I can glance at on the way out the door so I know what to expect.

I've got a world clock for the odd occurence I need to know another timezone.

I've got just a pretty clockhand one for when I'm out and about at an event or something.

And then I have the actual sunset one where you use the wheel to go over the position of the sun and corresponding time. Use it more in winter than anything.

So yeah, have a play and figure out what works for you."

2391,"You do you, but once I stopped with the screen protectors, I found I was much happier with the screen. The protectors scratch like nobody‚Äôs business, so I was constantly replacing the protectors. Finally, after I read enough watch owners who don‚Äôt bother with protectors, I decided to go naked. Guess what? Hardly any scratches and never any noticeable ones. 

(The cynic in me would say that the high scratchability of protectors gives users a false sense of ‚ÄúLook at all the scratches my watch would have!‚Äù whereas the watch really wouldn‚Äôt be affected by 90% of what dings up protectors.) 

(And this is someone who almost always had white paint scratched into her cheap watches because I **swear** the corners of walls lunge out at me ok maybe I‚Äôm just clumsy I hear my ADHD-I might explain my physical awkwardness but my point is I don‚Äôt have that problem with my Apple Watch screens I don‚Äôt know what glass they use but dude it‚Äôs amazing!)"
2392,This. I bought the screen protector CASE and I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you how many times I hit a door frame already lol. Replacing the screen isn‚Äôt really cheap but the case is a minor inconvenience
2393,"I bot a pack but I'm afraid of putting it on. Any tips, please?"
2394,"Screen protectors seem to reduce the touch sensitivity of the screen, unfortunately"
2395,"Eww gross no. It's a watch, wear it. People don't put ""screen protectors"" on their regular watches either. LOL this is nonsensical."
2396,"Same here. My friend earns less than me, has more expenses and rocks his phone and watch naked. He‚Äôs wearing clothes, just his watch and phone are naked. Wanted to make it clear.

Point is if he smashes them (not sexually, again want to clarify that) he‚Äôll just get a new one next year.

I need mine to last longer than an average marriage."
2397,First thing I did was flip the face upside down so I could wear it on my right wrist. Have never really thought about it much until now but having the crown on the upper right on *either* arm seems more awkward than the lower left.
2398,This was a big wow for me. Made a big difference.

2400,"I have the Peloton app syncing to the Health app with no duplication. 

Peloton syncs all the data and the heart rate is recorded by the Apple Watch."
2401,"
It has saved your watch zero times. If you think it has helped because the ""protector"" broke, all that means is that thing is weak. Screen ""protectors"" break in situations when the screen would have been fine anyway. It gives people the illusion that it helped when it really did not much at all."
2402,Do you have a link to any good watch straps? Been looking for some off Amazon but can‚Äôt find any I like lmao
2403,And ruin the stunning designü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2404,nah lol
2405,how do you keep it when not on your wrist? Straighten it out?
2406,The optimized battery charging system does that automatically. It‚Äôs available on the latest version of watchOS.
2407,I like collecting boxes
2408,do you guys keep the display always on or raise to wake? How much is the battery consumption difference?
2409,Uh no
2410,I had it for 6 months now and haven‚Äôt changed any setting. I turned on a few things when it was suggested to me.
2411,periodt
2412,I have had almost every iteration and I die a little each time. I like you just wear it and it looks fine until maybe the sun hits it just right and I can see just tiny scratches. I have never worn a bumper or skin/glass cover because I hate the feel of them. I would suggest AppleCare though as your safety net.
2413,So do I. The wrist cuff of the glove covers it for the most part.
2414,Need to change your business model
2415,"Might want to try a re pairing. Works flawlessly here. 

13PM + S7 watch. As soon as I unlock the phone with FaceID/passcode, the watch unlocks without having to type in the passcode within 1-2 seconds."

2417,ü§Øüôà
2418,"Might not notice too much change, but do you really need a countdown when washing your hands?"
2419,"I don‚Äôt remember, but it constantly checks for movement that looks like hand washing and uses sound recognition when movement (like hand wash) is detected which uses a lot of battery."
2420,You mean it actually works for you?!
2421,They‚Äôll break it
2422,"Disabling wake on wrist raise feature gets me over 36 hours of battery life, without it the max was a full day."
2423,">Hardly any scratches and never any noticeable ones.

lol, i said the same thing. give it a year. you'll regret it."
2424,"I hit my watch on everything when I used a case‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd randomly walk into walls (I‚Äôm a bit clumsy), but door frames etc. I haven‚Äôt used that case for over a year and haven‚Äôt gotten more than some really small scratches and don‚Äôt remember hitting anything in this period. I like the watch not being clumsy and would never go back to a case - and with the stronger glass on the series 7 I don‚Äôt see any reason too"
2425,"They give you a YouTube video link to watch and it‚Äôs pretty helpful. Just have your watch on a steady surface and the rest is pretty easy. Oh and if you put it on crooked, I found out that if you rub it outward with your finger and in the direction of the side you‚Äôre trying to correct, the material like stretches over without you having to even peel it off. It‚Äôs crazy but it helped a lot with getting a perfect fit. I love them. Glad I have 5 more lol."
2426,"These don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre incredibly thin but also thick enough to provide a barrier. Idk what they‚Äôre made of so it‚Äôs hard to explain, but I‚Äôm glad I slapped one on. I‚Äôve already dinged my watch against several places in the few days I‚Äôve owned it."
2427,"I just found out the hard way that a broken screen costs more than the cost of my S4. Watch fell off one time after 4 days of owning it, RIP"
2428,People get AppleCare + just for the sake of wearing/carrying their devices naked.
2429,Right?! Me too. Way easier to navigate the crown with my thumb!
2430,THIS
2431,"I feel stupid, can‚Äôt figure out how to copy a link from Amazon. I have Spigen, Adepoy, Elkson, and T-Engine off of Amazon. Leluxe straps I found on IG. There was a leather strap I had my eye on on IG but I can‚Äôt find them anywhere and forgot their name. There‚Äôs also companies on Etsy."
2432,When you scratch it you‚Äôll regret it
2433,I got it closed as my charger is angled at 45 degrees upwards
2434,It doesn‚Äôt do anything to account for fast charging wear and tear as far as I know.
2435,AoD significantly reduced the battery so I use the raise to wake while all health features on.
2436,"That‚Äôs how I did it when I got the original AW, though there weren‚Äôt a ton of apps available in the beginning anyway. It was just cool to try out new faces and read messages on my wrist."
2437,"Haha yes it‚Äôs sorta like with enough scratches you just don‚Äôt notice anymore‚Ä¶ I also keep telling myself, it‚Äôs a tool! But yes I‚Äôm amazed by how resilient it is."
2438,"Same with me, it unlocks super fast"
2439,plus it's so innacurate
2440,"You could say that for most things. Hey Siri, Noise background levels, Always on display, Heart rate monitor, step counter, etc. all working in the background. Sure, they add up, but they are really small and well optimized."
2441,"woah, so you‚Äôre saying that always on consumes less battery?"
2442,Heh. Had my last one since July 2018. Just upgraded a couple weeks ago. I think that's long enough to know I haven't regretted it. ;)
2443,I gave it 5 months and i am grateful for not using any protections. Same with my phone.
2444,Thanks for the tips! Appreciate it!
2445,"That‚Äôs good to know! I‚Äôll take a look then, thanks!"
2446,I agree
2447,"Thanks man! And it‚Äôs all good, I just looked them up lol. Really want a red watch strap as I think it‚Äôll look nice with my black watch"
2448,"No dude, it‚Äôs a watch, they get scratched. I do have Apple care and a all screen protector mind."
2449,"It will stop charging the watch past 80%, until it knows the time when you‚Äôre ready to use it, and then it charges it slowly up to the full 100%."
2450,"thanks, I do the same."
2451,Agreed! I fall into denial when I am thinking I am amazed that I don‚Äôt have scratches and then that sunlight and angle smack my back to reality. Then I‚Äôm like training myself that I can unsee what I just saw! And my version of ‚Äútool‚Äù is looking for the release date for the ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù version of the Apple Watch LOL
2452,Hand washing is not enabled by default because of its battery usage
2453,"Yeah, I mean, it‚Äôs a low-energy consumption feature, but of course if you disable the setting will get you extra juice for your watch."
2454,You‚Äôre welcome! üôÇ love your name. I‚Äôm a cat lady too haha.
2455,Leluxe has Red plain and red camouflage. I‚Äôve seen others on Amazon.

2461,"Never had an Apple Watch before until this one, but I think my usage must be a lot lower than others. I end a typical day with around 40-50% battery left with ‚Äòalways-on‚Äô enabled."
2462,"I think while the Always On Display (AOD) is nice, watchOS 6 brought some interesting changes that may lead the way for the watch in the future. Wasn't one mention of it, but will probably have an impact down the line as developers no longer need to 1. Link the app directly as an iOS application, and 2. No longer have to absolutely use Storyboards to build a watchOS UI (Programmatically was impossible in this regard until SwiftUI released).

I'm excited to see how this changes the watch for the future, and delete apps from my phone that really were just for the watchOS component."

2464,Do people really not like the blob UI? I always thought it was unique and well implemented.
2465,"You can try disabling ‚ÄúWake screen on wrists raise‚Äù, since it is not that useful with having AOD turned on. Turning it off saved me an additional day of battery life. It can last almost two days with 1h workout/day."

I dont want to carry my phone around while doing Sports and it‚Äòs one of the big question marks before getting an Apple Watch."
2468,[deleted]
2469,"My friends gf bought the series 5 too, she likes it but the battery tradeoff is real. She said she couldnt really use the always on screen because by the end of the workday the battery had almost depleted. She didnt even use it that much. I still think that a weeks worth of battery should be a must for such watches."
2470,He wears it on his right wrist sometimes even thought he‚Äôs a righty... ok fine. But the trackpad on the left side of the keyboard?! üò≥ Is he sure he‚Äôs right handed?
2471,"Always on display is literally the only reason I got this watch over the S4. 

The battery needs to be improved while allowing AoD ."
2472,TLDR: Enabling the always-on display drags down the battery life from incredible (>50% at the end of the day) to just decent (15-25%).
2473,The battery life took a hit because of that new always on display
2474,Am I the only one who doesn't understand the appeal of an always-on display?  What's the issue with having a motion response display?
2475,"It's likely he's a pretty hard user of tech.  The question is, if you turned 'always-on' off, how much does your battery go up?  I think a reasonable tradeoff is 5-10%, but seems it's closer to 20-30% for many users."
2476,"During the first week I was actually scared my unit was defective or something. I would end most days at 20-30%, and started thinking the always-on-display was the culprit.

Then after a week it magically got sorted out. Now most days I finish above 50% battery, even when doing workouts and using the watch normally. I think the combination of a) a lot of apps being installed from your phone b) indexing and c) watchOS 6.0 just made the watch stress too much. Letting indexing finish and updating to the latest patch fixed everything for me."
2477,Same. I‚Äôm usually between 40-60.
2478,I‚Äôm at around 35-40% around 10pm and that‚Äôs including a 30 minute workout in the morning at 8am.
2479,"Are you telling the watch to track your exercise at all?  The biggest drain for me happens on days where it is monitoring my activity.

For example, I started an outdoor walk this morning and walked 2+ miles.  At the end, my battery had dropped 13% in the span of 40 minutes due to measuring my heart and using the GPS.   At 8AM I was already down to 85%.  Had I not done any activity I would generally leave the house at nearly 100%.

The Series 5 appears to have a better battery than the series 4 to help with this, but on days where I'm doing 1-2 hours of exercise I see myself ending the day around 25% on my S5 where I would have been around 40% on my S3."
2480,"(Note: I haven't watched the review yet).  I wonder if this review was done on watchOS 6.0.0.  I heard multiple reports from early adopters that the battery life during the first week was abysmal, and it might have been due to some bug in the day one software.

I haven't had _any_ issues with battery life on my Series 5.  One day I logged around 4 hours of workouts, and still ended the day at 30%.  Most days I end above 50%."
2481,Because that‚Äôs his style. weird facial expressions and shrugs
2482,Because YouTube reviewers don‚Äôt actually review stuff. They just have crazy good production skills.
2483,What's notable about Watch OS 6?
2484,"Because it‚Äôs a Watch and not an OS review? Those things are related and he does mention a couple points where Watch OS 6 plays a role (noise measurement is also availible on older watches and he still mentions it) but if you expected a Watch OS review you just watched the wrong video. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know why you did, especially since none of the new features fundamentally change what the Apple Watch is or how it behaves, you know, things that would be actually relevant for an Apple Watch review.

Watch OS 6 has tons of quality of life improvements and little (non-central) feature additions and all of that is nice but listing them all (or even many of them) within an Apple Watch review is, well, it‚Äôs just not necessary or what one would expect."
2485,I am coming from Android (Galaxy S9+ and Galaxy Watch) so I am not super familiar with the icons. The list mode with the name next to it definitely helps me.
2486,"I don't like it.  The icons are too small and too close to each other, and I can never remember where anything is.  The list view is a bit better but forces me to scroll to get to things.

I really want a UI that has my favorite apps in a circle, with plenty of space between them, and a ""Show all"" button in the middle that drops me into the blob/honeycomb UI."
2487,I hate the blob UI. Give me lists plz
2488,[deleted]
2489,"Honestly I only use a couple of apps which are my complications. But I hate the blob UI

Luckily we have options."
2490,I don‚Äôt. List ftw.
2491,I use other watch faces purely as shortcut launchers only so I can avoid the blob UI.

2496,"Holy shit this may be the solution, I have a S5 sitting at home and I can‚Äôt wait to get home and try it out but it‚Äôs been very offputting with all the talks about battery life"

2506,"No. It‚Äôs just a software issue in watchOS 6.0

2507,It really shouldn't have much of an impact. Plenty of smartwatches in recent years managed it with negligible impact and Apple's got their special 'low power screen' with a much slower refresh rate compared to those.
2508,No it didn‚Äôt
2509,"My difference is around 20-30%.  I‚Äôm not regretting getting a series 5 over 4, but it is disappointing that one of the distinguishing features hurts the battery life this much. It‚Äôs not hard to turn the AOD off so it‚Äôs not something that is a deal breaker. I‚Äôm coming from a Galaxy Watch and while I like the Apple Watch more, the battery life on the Samsung is excellent. I also like the looks of the Galaxy Watch more since it looks more like a traditional watch, but the Apple Watch‚Äôs rectangular shape is definitely better as a touch screen."
2510,">It's likely he's a pretty hard user of tech

I think in another video he talks about he likes to turn up his brightness ALL the way, all the time. That's not how you are supposed to use things...

Also I think ending the day with 20-30% battery life is the point. You don't want it to die, but you want to use that batter life for a practical purpose, like, I don't know... keeping the screen on?"
2511,"I‚Äôm at 21% after 2 days of use, it seems like it varies wildly for everyone"
2512,">Because that‚Äôs his style. weird facial expressions and shrugs

Huh, I wasn't aware he was that unpopular here.

I kinda like his reviews. Sure, he often criticizes Apple products, but his complaints are in most cases valid.

&#x200B;

The fact he didn't mention Watch OS 6 is weird tho."
2513,"Helps hide stupid comments. Like on the iPhone 11 review, where he goes ""why didn't apple remove the notch, it's 2019 <so they should be magically able to fit everything under the screen somehow>""

Looking at the state of youtube, I'm glad he doesn't make a stupid face on the thumbnail"

2516,While looking at it in Grid View (blob) 3D Touch the screen and you can switch it to a list view.
2517,"They have a list option. ~~You can change it in settings. Why is this being downvoted? It‚Äôs factual. ~~

Oh actually it‚Äôs not in settings; you just hard press on the blob UI view and an option comes up where you can choose between grid view and list view. 

They call the blob view ‚Äògrid‚Äô for some reason. I guess a honeycomb is sort of a grid?"
2518,"True, but whenever I want to use an app that's not in the center, I'll search all over twice and still not find it. It's faster to just switch to list mode for those less used apps."
2519,This is exactly what I do. The list view made me feel like it took longer to find apps whereas my muscle memory on the blob UI feels faster.
2520,Or some people just have a preference for list view...
2521,"Or by tapping the screen, even easier."
2522,"That is a valid question. Both of them are enabled by default. I agree, it does not make much sense to have both of them enabled."
2523,"Maybe he was worried about scratches?  I dunno.  Honestly there‚Äôs something about the black titanium look that I personally don‚Äôt like, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm used to brushed metal on my tech"
2524,Thanks mate! :)
2525,"Which is mind buggling, it‚Äôs like they want me to switch over to Apple music. Luckily my fam pays for my spotify acc so I have no trouble coughing up the extra price for Apple Music"
2526,"I have a mouse and a trackpad too, but they‚Äôre both on the right. Although I don‚Äôt ever use them both within the same app. Do you and if so which apps? And are you ambidextrous or did that just take practice. 
Anyway I didn‚Äôt see a mouse near his setup..."
2527,But no one will come back on their review because it doesn't generate enough clicks
2528,Had the gear sport before the series 5. It was a much better looking watch. But so far I‚Äôm finding the series 5 a little nicer to use day to day.
2529,What the duck. But then again do fumble on it and use the messaging app sometimes.
2530,"He is massively predictable and that why i never listen to what he says. Its always like ‚Äúif you like samsung phones you are gonna like this one‚Äù ,‚Äùif you like iphones this one is the best yet‚Äù ,‚Äùif you are a fan of oneplus you are gonna love this one‚Äù. 

I only like his video footage"
2531,He's only unpopular here when he criticizes Apple.
2532,"He is unpopular here because he doesn't kiss Apple's ass like say iJustine does at every Apple item. People are way too sensitive here.Above you there is a comment complaining about his review of the 11 because MKBHD said why there is the notch still here or that big, it's a legitimate complain, it's the same design on the 3rd iteration, but people see it as an attack to their beloved brand."
2533,He's unpopular because he doesn't dive into every feature of Apple products that help the fanboys around here justify their new purchases. Features that won't be used by 99% of people.
2534,"Most sane reviewers are saying they should atleast shrink the notch after 2 years, which is fair considering you can shrink the earpiece."
2535,">	Looking at the state of youtube, I'm glad he doesn't make a stupid face on the thumbnail

Those grate me so much."
2536,"> ""why didn't apple remove the notch, it's 2019 <so they should be magically able to fit everything under the screen somehow>""

Very clearly referring to the other already-existing solutions (pop-up cameras, etc). Not that I think they could/would have done it anyway, seems pretty mechanically stressful for the pop-up camera to go up every time you unlock the device."
2537,"He hasn't been a ""reviewer"" for a long time, he's a tech commentator, nothing more. He's probably the last person I go to for reviews."
2538,"I've got a very particular situation. I went through a few stretches where my right hand and/or arm had bad nerve pain, so I've learned to use both mice and trackpads ambidextrously. My hands *really* hate the Magic Mouse (and a lot of other mice), so I use a Surface Mouse (the only mouse I've found that I can use consistently without pain), and I mostly use the trackpad for scrolling or for when my right hand needs a break. 

I use a lot of art and design apps, so being able to pan and zoom quickly and without contorting my hands is essential (scrolling a lot with a scroll wheel and occasional modifier key starts to hurt, whereas I can scroll in any direction all day with a trackpad). That, and sometimes using the trackpad just plain feels nicer (especially on a smaller screen or work area)."
2539,i believe he uses for editing and stuff on final cut like with gestures. You can do **a lot** more with the trackpad than the mouse for certain use cases.
2540,"Those things are Giant, gaudy, and cheap looking"
2541,"He seems more unpopular when he gets things wrong. He's usually pretty fair, if anything leaning positive, but it's annoying when he gets stuff wrong, which does more often than other tech reviewers of his notoriety.

He makes up for it in cool looking shots though."
2542,"He's unpopular because his videos are shallow, many accusing him of merely reading spec sheets. Not to mention his frequent blatant errors. In a recent video he referred to the *iPhone 7S* ffs."

I actually got a lot of compliments from Apple Watch owners for how it looked more like a classic watch and the spinning bezel was always a Wow factor. 

I think the Apple Watch is pretty and pretty great in use but if I had a fancy dinner party (not gonna happen) I‚Äôd definitely pick the gear sport to blend in more with the traditional mechanical watch crowd."

2550,"> cheap looking

Well that's just not true is it."
2551,"Indeed, it can do. Samsung went to a really big extreme when they did it with their Note series, and Apple still would need more space than just a camera for their Face ID tech so it would be possible to get a compromise."

2569,"As someone who was on the fence about smart watches for years, it was a pleasant experience with the Apple Watch SE thus far. I hardly go anywhere without it!

I was comparing it with I think the 6, but I settled for SE because 

1. I don‚Äôt need an always on display
2. Don‚Äôt need the blood monitoring thingy
3. ITS VALUE FOR MONEY!

I know a lot of people love the AOD but personally, I don‚Äôt dig it because I have this crazy theory that it drains your battery faster."
2570,"Got one .
Love it"
2571,My first Apple Watch is this one
2572,"A good Apple Watch for those who are new to Apple Watch. You get almost every features that the Series 4, 5, and 6 has at a very good price. Definitely worth the money."
2573,I accidentally smashed my Series 4 literally 42 days outside of my AppleCare warranty and ended up buying an SE to replace it with. It‚Äôs like 99% of the features for 70% of the price. Hard to go wrong in terms of value.
2574,Bought for me and my wife two SE (40mm and 44mm). We are so happy about them.
2575,"I‚Äôm very happy, I moved from Fitbit and have no regrets."
2576,Love it. Avoided Apple watch for a long time due to battery life concerns but my SE lasts 2 days and i simply love it  can turn on the lights with it. Make calls (within range etc). Just brilliant
2577,Got mine with that exact same strap! Very happy with it.
2578,I love mine!
2579,Bought it over the 5 because I don't need all the two extra features the 5 has.
2580,Best bang for the buck.
2581,"I love the SE. I can say it‚Äôs even better than the 6 because of Cost and that it has more storage than the S3, so it‚Äôs a win for me. Plus I use it all the time when I‚Äôm listenin to Music, so I don‚Äôt have to rewind a song from my phone when I can do it on my wrist. And let‚Äôs not forget the Fitness. Major plus for me. I‚Äôve been a Apple Watch owner for over a year now, movin from the S3 to the SE and I‚Äôm glad I decided to get it, because this watch is a Game Changer!"
2582,I've got one
2583,"The lack of always on display is a no no for me, I would rather get a used series 5 (Have had mine for over a year) but at this point just wait for the next to come out. Amazing value though"
2584,"The 3 major features that it ‚Äúlacks‚Äù are gimmicks: 

The always-on display is always on for who? You have to raise your wrist to your line of sight to see the display anyway.

The ECG is underwhelming and not recommended by Apple nor medical professionals to be taken as an end-all, whether you are heart-healthy or not.

Almost nobody knew what a blood oxygen sensor was before the Apple Watch Series 6.

I strongly recommend it for everyone: the financially stable, health-aficionados, health buffs, and everybody else in between."
2585,"I think that's the best Apple Watch made to date, because how many first Watch users can buy a great device with much lower price (especially in more poor countries where it makes really significant difference). Great business decision and execution. Win for users and for Apple."
2586,Upgraded from series 3 to SE back a few months ago and I love it
2587,"It‚Äôs a good option but only in the US. It‚Äôs still too expensive everywhere else. I got a slightly used 44mm cellular S5 which had 99% of the battery health still remaining for much cheaper, and they have almost the same hardware!"
2588,I love it
2589,I loved mine. Had it for a couple weeks then it broke (Apple replaced it for free) but I need an Apple Watch so I upgraded to the series 6. It‚Äôs a great buy. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about it was no always on display.
2590,"The SE is my first Apple Watch, bought it in March. I love it, though sometimes I wish I‚Äôd gotten the cellular version."
2591,"I always wonder how people manage with the default grid app view. One of the first things I did was change it to list mode, far less cluttered.

Huge fan of the SE though, very good value for money."
2592,"I upgraded from a launch model to an SE back in February, and I‚Äôve been super happy with the upgrade. It‚Äôs honestly a night and day difference.

I went from barely using it for anything other than checking the time or notifications to constantly using siri and actually using different apps on it."
2593,"I am considering getting one. It would be my first Apple Watch, if ever, and I am thrilled to read the positive comments in this post!"
2594,Went from S3 to the SE over the S6 and don‚Äôt regret it. Maybe should have waited since the S7 will have flat sides but overall the SE was a no brainer.
2595,"I've got it for 9 months now, an awesome buy. I don't care really much about AOD since 95% of times Apple Watch does an excellent job showing me the time when I raise my arm. O2 sensor and EKG? Nice things to have but not a must for my use.

About the chipset, S5 is still going to be updated for years and I'm sure it'll perform like a champ for the next 3 years. U1 chip might be the thing that I'd like most to have, but I'm using an iPhone XS without the U1 too, so I can live without that."
2596,"I think if someone doesn‚Äôt need or want the always-on display, it‚Äôs the best deal for a smart watch."
2597,I‚Äôve had the SE since December and i love it
2598,I‚Äôve had my SE for about six weeks now. It‚Äôs my first ever smart watch and I love it.
2599,I love my SE. Upgraded from a S1 after 4 years and the battery life is amazing. Longest it‚Äôs lasted me in one charge is 40 hours
2600,SE was my intro to Apple Watch and I like it a lot. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to get the 6 especially for the added price.
2601,Best value. No need for the extra $40 for the 6
2602,I love mine!
2603,"I've got one, good to play games too"
2604,It‚Äôs a watch
2605,"SE makes no sense. While S6 has AoD, oxygen measure, ECG, what can SE give to you? Just a functionality of mi band. Would never recommend."
2606,I got one as an upgrade from my Apple Watch S0 üòÄ
2607,"I had one, excellent"
2608,"Really happy with it. Only thing that‚Äôs slightly annoying is the having to bring the watch up to activate it, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work."
2609,Love mine!
2610,Got one two weeks ago. I‚Äôm addicted now.
2611,Bang for your buck
2612,"It‚Äôs my first Apple Watch, bought it February and synced to either my personal or work iPhones it is phenomenal. I don‚Äôt have a wide wrist so the 40mm works and looks well on me; I love my SE!"
2613,"It is the watch that people should buy. I love my Series 6 and it is the right choice for me, but the SE is just a great value for a smart watch."
2614,I love mine
2615,SE is awesome
2616,I have a series 4 and got my fianc√© a SE for Christmas. Best bang for the buck AW.
2617,"Aluminum one is really nice, I love how it looks!"
2618,"Amazing imo. Been using mine for the last couple of months and it‚Äôs been amazing so far. First Apple Watch I‚Äôve bought and even seen (they‚Äôre not as popular where I live‚Ä¶ small town in Chile) so I can‚Äôt really compare, but it‚Äôs all I thought it was and more."
2619,For the price difference I saved up for the series 6 so I could have the always on display. Given it‚Äôs gonna be an investment for me I decided to save a little longer to get it. Now I‚Äôm waiting for the series 7 to come out hopefully in September lol
2620,I‚Äôve been using my series 1 for 5 years and I can‚Äôt believe I wanted so much to change it
2621,Love the look. Been wanting one ever since I got my iPhone about a year ago. Trying to save up for the watch and the AirPod prosüòÅ
2622,I love my SE. Well this is my second one after Apple replaced my first purchase
2623,I love mine. It‚Äôs my first AW and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out on the 6. For now atleast.
2624,"Dang, i really need a new apple watch, this looks sick compered to my series 3 apple watch üòÇ"
2625,"I love my SE, and was able to get it with a discount. No complaints here."
2626,I just got mine today! I love it so much
2627,"I just traded in my Apple Watch 3 for an SE. I went with the bigger size, and cellular model, and both of those were huge improvements. I love it. It also feels much snappier than the 3."
2628,"As someone who doesn't give a damn about EKG and AOD, the SE was perfect for me. Then again, I use Voiceover with screen curtain enabled. Helps me get almost 50 hours out of this thing. Only thing I wish it had was 5 GHz WiFi."
2629,"It‚Äôs great, I love mine. I hope they have SE2 by the time mine breaks."
2630,I have one :)
2631,Poland?
2632,"Certainly not exactly a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù watch, but for what it offers, it‚Äôs a rather decent deal. Pretty happy with my AW SE"
2633,I went for series 6 which is the most feature rich version but the SE is fine for younger people
2634,I love my Apple Watch SE it's a fantastic product for its price.
2635,Love it.
2636,Love that band! Which one is it?
2637,"How does the SE compare to the 3 practically speaking? I can read specs, but I‚Äôd like to know how it plays out in practice. I‚Äôve had a 3 for about a year now, and it gets bogged down a lot. I don‚Äôt even have a lot on it. Just playing music and Nike Run Club at the same time can cause crashes."
2638,The apple watch most people should buy. Best bag for your buck with the least compromise.
2639,In love with mine. Nike SE from now on
2640,I love it and well worth the price.
2641,"The SE has served me brilliantly! Best value for money by far. In fact, I have the same band as yours too! Which has also served me brilliantly in cooperation with the cream sports loop! Though mine is a 44mm cellular instead of 40mm regular. Hope you enjoy yours!"
2642,Thinking about getting my girlfriend one. Anyone hearing anything on an update this fall?
2643,Hm yes this appears to be an Apple Watch alright
2644,Good value for money
2645,Is that an aliexpress or original strap?
2646,"I have an SE and it's really good. The only thing I wish I got was the cellular version. 

Other than that, it's solid."
2647,Its brilliant
2648,I love my 6 but the SE is enough for most
2649,üëç
2650,Loving mine - picked it up for 230 euros in pretty good condition- excellent value
2651,Anybody have any photos of different bracelets with the standard grey SE?
2652,I love my SE! Great investment.
2653,"I decided to go with the SE as well, as I won't use Always-On (my girlfriend turned hers off to save battery and improve privacy) and am not in need of the health features of the Series 6. Also, my choice of style (color and metal) is the same on the SE and Series 6, so although I could just as well have bought a Series 6, I couldn't see any reason to not just take the SE, as the things I need is identical."
2654,"I‚Äôm loving it. No need spending twice the price for sensors I‚Äôm not gonna use. I do miss the AOD a little bit, but definitely not enough to justify the price of an S6"
2655,"I bought an S3 back in 2019 to see if I would fit with an Apple Watch and really took to it, then I got the SE when it came out, mostly for the bigger display as I didn‚Äôt feel I‚Äôd miss any of the other features and it‚Äôs been incredible. I passed the S3 on to my wife and she loves it."
2656,DONT TAKE IT SWIMMING!!! MINE DIED!!
2657,Mighty fine!
2658,AMAZING!
2659,A really good upgrade from the series 3 in terms of speed and screen size
2660,Absolutely worth it!
2661,"Upgraded from a ¬£60 fitbit and WOW I‚Äôm impressed. I had the fitbit inspire (without heart rate) before, but I made the decision to buy the SE a year and a half after I got it. The fitbit was basically a pedometer that can tell the time, and the AW is what a smartwatch should be. The features I liked best after upgrading were: colours & custom face, apps, Apple health stats, and the way it syncs so easily with my phone without having to open up the AW app. Really impressed with it so far and glad I got it over the S3 and S6"
2662,My first Apple Watch and I love it.
2663,"If you don‚Äôt need Always on display it has everything else, minus the rarely used ECG (more useful for heart patients) which was introduced in Apple Watch 5 and the unreliable oximeter introduced in Apple Watch 6."
2664,Seems like a reasonably good product in terms of price and looks
2665,"I bought the S5 after the S3 got broken before the launch of s6 
The screen always on function is a huge battery drainer so i never used it"
2666,Honestly the Apple Watch SE is the like best Apple Watch you can get right now apart from the Apple Watch Series 6 it‚Äôs a really good watch recommended I own it I‚Äôve owned it since 2 July and it has been the best watch watch
2667,I think the se is really Gud even now that they have the ecg on it
2668,Love mine!
2669,I have the same watch band and everything but mines like space grey or something
2670,I love it when baby cyborgs show up.
2671,I personally love mines
2672,"The SE is a great watch! Love your sport loop, btw! :)"
2673,Nice band! I got the same üòâ
2674,I got one a little bit over a year ago. I actually love it more and more. It's a great product for the price.
2675,Great watch for a great price
2676,I have the S5 and the battery life is very poor. I need to charge it up everyday. I have a Fitbit Charge 4 as well and that lasts 7 days without a charge.
2677,"GPS on the SE is the same as on the 6, ja?"
2678,My first smart watch and I love it. Super useful in keeping track of your fitness and wellness goals.
2679,I charge mine for only 15 minutes a day while I'm showering and pooping and it never dies.
2680,I like the bang for buck you get with the SE but I had to get a always ON display & yes I know it‚Äôs NOT worth the extra money.
2681,just got it  from black friday and love it!!!  need to watch videos on it tho on youtube to get use to and how to make the watch more usefull but love it!
2682,same here
2683,Absolutely the same feeling here
2684,Same man it‚Äôs changed the game for me lol
2685,"Right? I have a Series 6, but tbh I can't even remember why I opted for it over the SE lol."
2686,Everything since the 4 looks the same. Mind you after owning a 4 for nearly 4 years I am happy that it still looks modern apart from the scratches
2687,"The SE is very nice. If I was upgrading this year, that‚Äôs what I would have gone with. However, I upgraded last year from an S1 to S5 and absolutely love the always on display. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to a watch that doesn‚Äôt have it. The EKG I could very easily go without, it‚Äôs neat and I guess nice to know everything‚Äôs fine but it wouldn‚Äôt be something that I wanted to hang onto like the always on display is."
2688,"Likewise, btw how did you put that flair under your @ that appears whenever you comment on a post in this subreddit?"
2689,"exactly I got an SE too, but from where I am, the SE is  actually 70$ expensive than the Series 6 in U.S. due to the taxes and stuff.  Sk basically if I was in U.S. this money would have gotten me S6 but I lobe my SE anyway :)"
2690,"or AOD, but same thing still applies"
2691,"Exactly , especially the battery life after S0."
2692,Yeah your statement is true. AOD drains battery . IMO I think Apple will discontinue the S3 this year and bring the SE‚Äôs price down even more . The SE is what the Apple Watch was meant to be . Instead of paying an overpriced $399
2693,Not crazy. My Samsung Galaxy S9+ had always on display. The battery would drain slightly faster with it on
2694,[removed]
2695,me too!
2696,I have a 4 - what features are missing from the SE?
2697,"What do you like better about the SE vs 3? I‚Äôm trying to decide which to get, not sure if the SE is worth 35% more in price?"
2698,I don‚Äôt get why many people want this feature anyway? You could just raise your wrist and the screen will instantly turn on. Not to mention AOD takes up lots of battery!
2699,The always on display is annoying as hell in a movie theater and can get you kicked out if you don‚Äôt turn it off.
2700,agreed
2701,i agree it cost me US$379.15 here in isr ael for the very 40mm base model!
2702,how did it break?
2703,forgot the list mode was an option‚Äîtrying it out now!
2704,"Thats why I uploaded this post, I‚Äôm glad it helped (:"
2705,extra $40??? I thought it was extra $100
2706,Why pay more for features that you don't want?
2707,"The functionality of a Mi Band?  The SE does everything that an S6 does minus the AoD, ECG, and blood oxygen. Judging by your flair you know what an apple watch can do so..."
2708,"I believe series 5 costs less, and I‚Äôd never get a watch without AOD after trying one."
2709,The Deep Navy Sports Loop!
2710,I have the GPS only version. Bought it last October because I was on a prepaid phone plan which doesn't allow any extra devices. I just switched to postpaid so I'll be looking to get the cellular version here soon. I'll definitely be sticking with the SE though. No reason to pay extra for features that I'm not interested in and the SE is a great price for what it offers.
2711,Really? It‚Äôs supposed to be okay to swim with right ?
2712,"All the numbers in your comment added up to 69.0. Congrats!

    60 +
    3 +
    6 +
    = 69.0"
2713,Always on display is pretty neat though. I would miss that if I no longer had it
2714,"The fancy o2 sensor that suggestively advertised that it might help you manage something about your health*.  
(*But Apple can‚Äôt get the medical certification to really say with any certainty that it will actually help you‚Ä¶)

I know. I got conned by the S6 too. 
I think the S6 has the always on thing and a brighter screen. 

But since it drains so much power I keep the screen off, and only really see the benefit of the bright screen when I need to pee in the middle of the night."
2715,Same. Every time I wish I had a hundred or so bucks for something else the series 6 haunts me lol
2716,"For me, it was Color, Fast Charge, the extra battery life, and the faster processor all made me jump. AOD is super nice, too. Plus, I got a $150 discount, so why not!"
2717,"No EKG sensor, S6 have better heart measurement, Blood O2, no always on, no steel variant, better chipset, no U1 chip"
2718,[deleted]
2719,How‚Äôs the battery after 4 years?
2720,"Why do you need always on display if you don‚Äôt always look at the watch? It drains the battery x3 faster.
Is it to make it look more pretty?"
2721,You can go set a user flair in the settings for this sub!
2722,Where do you live?
2723,"Eh, I‚Äôve not had any battery issues with my Series 6 yet. In fact, I am getting better battery life right now than when I was using my Series 6, without messing with the display."
2724,Then why are you here? üòÇ
2725,The SE doesn‚Äôt have the ECG I think
2726,First thing I did with my series 6 was turn off AOD
2727,For me when I‚Äôm lifting I like to glance without having to put the weights down to flick my wrist a particular way
2728,I thought I‚Äôd like it but I found it to be more annoying. So it‚Äôs off. Now I wish I just saved the money and got an SE :(
2729,"Mostly for aesthetics, I want people to see it, it looks much cooler, and gives it much more personality. It is convenient as well not having to fully raise your wrist or care at all if it will turn on or not. When new I noticed around 20% extra battery with it off, but for my usage the extra battery was never needed. When I know I‚Äôm staying home I switch it off though"
2730,"Once you get used to it you can‚Äôt go back, imo. Also I still get 1-2 days out of my series 5 with AOD on."
2731,In my job it would activate all the time if I had raise to wake on and suck up FAR more battery than AOD does.
2732,To be able to just glance at the watch and get a ton of info makes it a must for me. Especially like on the bike.
2733,"Sometimes I like being able to look at my wrist and not have to do anything to see the time. It‚Äôs more natural for me to glance at my wrist to see the time instead of raising my wrist up to turn the display on.  

I turned raise to wake off. I can see the always on display fine without it"
2734,"With the tech, aod sips power, if that on the watch"
2735,Theatre mode...
2736,"There has always been a cinema mode in the control centre though, it even used to be called theatre mode. And with the screen off, you can light it up just slightly by rotating the crown up, than back down to dim. They thought of everything"
2737,"I really don‚Äôt know. The screen wouldn‚Äôt turn on but if you touched it, it would still do stuff like you could feel it vibrate if you clicked on something. Me and the guy at Best Buy had no idea how or why it did that."
2738,Why pay 300‚Ç¨ for notification sender?
2739,"Without this options Apple Watch is mostly Notification Center for me. Sometimes music controller, which is still mi band functions. Apple Pay doesn‚Äôt seem that useful when you always have an iPhone in pocket. The only interesting feature is MacBook unlock, but it‚Äôs kinda security hole in many scenarios for me and ecosystem only. Apps are mostly useless, just like terrible realisation of telegram app. So you see my point I hope."
2740,"And one more thing, look at price gap between mi band and Watch SE. That is a big one. Especially when you consider those devices as pretty similar. Yet, price gap between SE and 6-7 is much lesser, but you are having whole Apple Watch experience with a lot of health features and so on. That‚Äôs a personal opinion of course, but my thoughts about this is when you spend a couple of hundred bucks, pay a bit more and have a lot more. If not, just go with cheaper similar thing which even lives longer."
2741,On testing my S6 over several weeks I find there is no noticeable difference in battery life with AOD on or turned off.
2742,"Fun fact: I recently tried to turn off always on, since I was in a forest without any chance to charge and it didn‚Äôt really change battery life. Still the same 1,25 days"
2743,"Yea, AOD and the Blue Aluminum was enough for me to go Series 6. But if you don‚Äôt care about those two things, there‚Äôs just no reason to spend the extra cash."
2744,"for me on a budget, I‚Äôd happily miss those things out for an SE and a unspent hundred bucks. If I had more money I‚Äôd definitely go for the s6 for the AOD and stainless steel option"
2745,"Also worse GPS. I think the SE is kind of a trap. With the series 7, the 6 will become TE watch to buy even if on a budget."
2746,Good ECG is important. This from AW is not good and gives a lot of false positives.
2747,"He can't answer that because it hasn't been 4 years since the release of the Series 4. It's been 3.

EDIT: Actually hasn't been 3 years yet, either. It will be so next month."
2748,"As someone else pointed out, it's only been out for about 3 years now, but I got my s4 on release and the battery is still pretty similar to when I got it... About a day and a half or so."
2749,Honestly haven‚Äôt noticed much of a change but I never really let it below 30%
2750,"Personally I turn it in during workouts and I feel it‚Äôs very useful in those cases. I always have trouble getting the screen to turn on while running, biking or swimming and it‚Äôs very convenient to see your stats at a glance. After the workout, I usually turn it off. The battery drain is not worth it IMO."
2751,"I like that I can glance at it and tell the time, rather than doing the wrist motion. I've got no idea where the battery drain is, it lasts all day and then some, that's a non issue for me."
2752,"with AOD on and display set to max brightness, my cellular model will last till 6am. I get up at 6-7. 24 hour battery life isn't that bad"
2753,"Really? I'm just not gonna turn it off, then! Apple's tech that went into it seems to sip battery, my 44mm does last all day, but needs charged every night"
2754,same thing over here on my series 6
2755,"Strange, or maybe not as I use my watch frequently for phone calls, emails and notifications.

I tried the always on option the first time I had the watch, it ended up running low after the first day of use. 
I‚Äôd say from 9am till 9pm, it had less than 20% left, from full. 

But when I keep the screen off and tap to use, I can easily get two days of use."
2756,"That‚Äôs what the SE is aimed for. You want to try Apple Watch? Buy SE, you love Apple Watch? Buy Series 6, that have many more features"
2757,"I have a S4 and this perfectly explains why I won‚Äôt be upgrading to a SE. I use 30 second timers for my workouts (as well as workout tracking and a different app to cue the exercise sequence), and it is so goddamn annoying that I can‚Äôt see how long is left on the timer or how long the workout has been or what zone my heart rate is in without pecking at my watch like a retarded bird trying to peck it‚Äôs way into a coconut.

I‚Äôm hoping S7 also has a better battery life too, but I‚Äôll be basically upgrading for AOD."
2758,Change your face to infograph modular and the change the complications. Put the timer on the front of your watch. You can see it then.
2759,AOD ?
2760,It only shows up when the display turns on though_when I‚Äôm able to turn my wrist forwards me or tap it (not often possible / easy if I‚Äôm in a plank position or what have you).
2761,Always On Display. :)
2762,Ah makes sense!
2763,"The review lift is Monday I believe, so all the tech reviews will come out then."
2764,"No, it‚Äôs not out to reviewers yet."
2765,"Embargo lifts today, so you will see hands on reviews on YouTube"
2766,I bought mine in November and am happy with it
2767,"If you can spring for the se I think it‚Äôs generally faster, but at the core, they do the same thing. If you want a budget option to get into Apple Watch, the series 3 is a good bet."
2768,Yes. I was debating the se or 3. I eventually went with the 40 mm se but it took me like a week to decide after seeing reviews and my needs.
2769,"One thing to take into account is the memory of the watches. I believe the serried 3 has 8gb while the SE has 32gb. I work at a target and a few people I know with the series 3 have said that they can run out of memory and have to remove some things. 

So factor in that the SE has three times the memory too"
2770,Get the se just for the screen it‚Äôs a game changer
2771,"i think it's a fine fitness-centric watch when you can get it for $120-130 USD, but at the $200 USD msrp, i feel you can do better (Garmin 245, 645 or Vivoactive 4, for example). not sure what Canadian prices are like for those, though"
2772,"S3 will do you the job, but in long term use, the SE is a night and a day difference. Nothing in S3 can be superior to SE."
2773,I would definitely go for the se as the screen size and responsiveness is something you will thanks for.
2774,"I have a series 3 (bought ~8 months ago) and I love it, but if i was buying one today I would honestly get the SE (or 6, for the always on display.)

Its a great watch and does almost everything the SE does, but the 8gb of memory can be a real pain when updating (not every update, but some of them.)

I can‚Äôt really store music on it, as there is no space for more than a few 
songs.

The screen is small (I have the 38mm) and sometimes hard to tap. The SE would be far better for this. Can be slightly annoying to use at times.

Some of the newer faces are missing on the 3.

The SE is a little faster. Not that the 3 is particularly slow, but an extra second or so here and there can be noticeable.

In summary, It‚Äôs not a huge difference as the essential parts are the same. I mean, its watch that has notifications and can track your movements.  But the incremental improvements are worth the extra money to me.

After the next OS update the differences might become more stark.  If you can afford it, I would get the SE."
2775,"Oh great to hear you are liking it. Does the  watch OS 7 feel peppy right out of the box for you?
See some reviews saying it can be take a few moments launching things as opposed to instantaneous."
2776,"What's the news regarding software updates? I'd hate to buy a watch and next year, it stops getting OS updates :<"
2777,"You mean storage, not memory."
2778,I agree the SE is SO MUCH BETTER! Just the screen itself plus I like the 44mm better than the 42mm
2779,Very peppy
2780,"I‚Äôve had mine since Christmas 2019, and it‚Äôs been solid. I love it"
2781,You really commented that after almost an entire year? Lol
2782,Yeah. A lot of people myself including are searching se vs series 3 due to black Friday deals
2783,You really commented that after almost an entire 9days? Lol
2784,Exactly! I ended up getting the SE myself. I‚Äôll probably sell it when they make one that reads blood pressure.
2785,"If you don‚Äôt see the value you don‚Äôt. 

I use my S5 22/7 with 1-2 hours off for charging each day."
2786,"It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù device but ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù.
I bought my s4 AW more then half year ago.
Yes it‚Äôs fun, convenient in some cases, but having it doesn‚Äôt change too much."
2787,"Just scroll this forum for one of the other 10,000 posts asking the same thing"
2788,"Battery life is fine.  I usually have ~50% left after a full day with screen on.  That is with about 30 minutes or more exercising with gps.  It is not a must have, but it is the most complete smartwatch for an iPhone.  I previously used a Garmin which is better if you are training for something in particular, but I found the Apple Watch to be good enough for fitness and much better at other features (music, maps, podcasts, messaging, gym membership card, movie theater tickets)"
2789,"I went from the Fitbit Versa 2 to the AW5. I thought charging it daily would be an issue, but I don't really mind it. I get 1,5 days of battery. Wish it charged a bit faster tho.

I think I would be fine with the S3, but the watch faces, AOD and the slimmer and better design had me."
2790,"I‚Äôm so glad I upgraded from the 4 to the 5.  Always on was it‚Äôs own reason for me.  Feels like an actual watch now.  Battery life is great.  I were mine for probably 20 hours a day.  Granted, I turn theatre mode on while sleeping, but other than that I rarely run out."
2791,"If you want to get in shape and be healthier, buy it,"
2792,Take the s4 stainless steel
2793,Just got the series 5 and absolutely love it. Way better than the Fitbit I used to have. The always on display is great. So far for me the battery life isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs still good. I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs worse the first few days but gets better. Anything else in particular turning you off it?
2794,"I switched from FB Charge2 (boo Google) to AW5.

No one can tell you if it‚Äôs worth it, b/c $400+ may mean not paying rent to someone vs not even worrying about it for someone else.

I think EVERYONE should wear some type of health tracker.  The AW is right for me b/c it has a great heart monitor, and I can workout w/o having to pull my phone from my pocket.

If money is tight, I would go with something cheaper."
2795,Other smartwatches have notoriously shitty quality. If you get an Apple Watch I advise getting the stainless steel model. It has a sapphire screen and will last you for many years to come.
2796,"I bought my aw 5 when it came out.
I'm not 100% sure wheter this is better than Samsung watch I had.

General user experience is slightly better, but the battery life... I Have disabled Siri and always on Display. 

Still having only 30% after using the watch 23 hours. My Samsung gear lasten easily 2-3 days, this has to be charged on daily basis. 

Its not problem if you dont need sleep tracking or you dont use it as a vibrating alarm clock."
2797,"I had the same question a few months ago and ended up buying the S3 for a few reasons.

First, since the S5 was released the S3 price was lowered to $189 making it pretty cheap to give a try.

Second, the S5 had a few additional features but since i never owned another AW i wouldn't be able to appreciate those new features on their own since everything was new for me.

Third, i'm a sucker for ecosystem features. As an owner of an XR, a macbook and a pair of airpods, i wanted to see what more i could do with them.

&#x200B;

For me, it's a really convenient remote control for your iPhone with a few extra features, but nothing close to a must have."
2798,My dad has the s5 and I have the s4 and personally don‚Äôt notice any difference. If you can get an s4 on sale I would get that.
2799,"Just buy it. If you don't find it useful, return it and get your refund."
2800,"The S5 is my first apple watch. Before that, I had a fitbit ionic with 7 days of battery life. Moving from 7 days to 1 and a bit days was tough... but oh my god an always on display is so worth it!!! I can't put into words why however. I think its just so much more functional with the ability to glance quickly without flicking your write like an idiot idk.

Would recommend."
2801,"If it‚Äôs your first Apple Watch, then yes. If you‚Äôre currently using an S3 or S4. It‚Äôs not much an upgrade unless you want Always On Display."
2802,"It‚Äôs definitely a luxury. If you have the money then you should get it. If not then it‚Äôs not an item that is needed.

It definitely can make things easier."
2803,Do you have always on display turned ON and still get 22hrs battery life?
2804,"Haha, very true"
2805,Thanks for the info pal üëä
2806,How do you have that battery life?  I'm lucky if I get 16-17 hours before it shuts itself off.
2807,How long will it take to charge?
2808,It's one of the main reasons I wanted to buy but is it really helps/motivate me? Coz I barely had friends and family members that use apple watch to challenge them..
2809,"If they do, I would love to know how.  I'm on the latest OS version and get about 16 hours max before it shuts itself off.  I'm really regretting upgrading."
2810,"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That is my experience.  I use it more as a passive device other than workouts and podcasts, so maybe that is why."
2811,2 hours +/-
2812,"Just get the S4. The screen upgrade is worth the jump from S3to 4. I have the S4 and unless the S6 is going to be a game changer I‚Äôm not upgrading. Every watch ‚Äúmotivates‚Äù you. It all runs the same OS...

Do you need your watch display always on or can you tap the watch or rotate your wrist? Do you need a compass? I forget if it has any upgraded hardware. Save the money and get the S4"
2813,It will definitely  motivate  you to be more active. You challenge  yourself everyday to improve  so the friends  part is secondary.
2814,"I don't do anything special. I wear my S5 from 6:30AM to 9PM every day. I regularly take it off with 40-50% charge left. On Saturdays I have the workout function going for 4 hours and have 20-30% left at the end of the day. The only time I've had battery issues is when I've left my phone at home, and I use the watch to take a phone call. That ate the battery like crazy."
2815,You upgraded from what series?
2816,"Yes I can see AOD is kinda dealbreaker to me TBH. but I‚Äôm afraid it will remain the battery quick tho but based on the other comments it looks like it got a decent battery life, I‚Äôm not sure about s4 by s5 will come with 32gb of storage. And the other main reason for me to go to s5 is the price of s4 and s5 is very close in the Country I live."
2817,Thanks mate
2818,Same I use AOD and raise-to-wake and nothing else special. I work pretty early so my watch comes off the charger at 3:30AM. By the time I go to bed around 9PM I've still got around 40% or so left so I imagine I could get around 24 hours out of it and just charge it in the morning before work.
2819,s4 doesn't have AOD.
2820,"Well if the price is the same more or less and you are buying it for the first time then yeah that makes sense. Already having a S4, I can‚Äôt justify getting the S5 as an upgrade."
2821,"Seriously tho, does it tell the time!! 

Or wait thats one of its key features, it tells the time is several wonderful ways"
2822,"I can't believe he said it lasts more than 24 hours!!!

Also what size you think that is? Looks 42. "
2823,"I'm guessing the battery life will vary on each user. if you have 500 notifications each day then no, itll die, but with me, and only getting email/txt alerts, and not the twitter/fb/IG/etc, I shyld get over a day, but ill charge every night , just like my phone."

Dye just loves the way they look. ‚ÄúWe thought that there was something beautiful about jellyfish, in this sort of space-y, alien, abstract sort of way,‚Äù he says. But they didn‚Äôt just visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium with an underwater camera. They built a tank in their studio, and shot a variety of species at 300 frames-per-second on incredibly high-end slow-motion Phantom cameras. Then they shrunk the resulting 4096 x 2304 images to fit the Watch‚Äôs screen, which is less than a tenth the size. Now, ‚Äúwhen you look at the Motion face of the jellyfish, no reasonable person can see that level of detail,‚Äù Dye says. ‚ÄúAnd yet to us it‚Äôs really important to get those details right.‚Äù

2841,"Marques did a good review of a product that was supposed to be premium but was lacking a lot of premium features.  The one mistake he made in the video was immediately recognized and addressed.  He said it wasn't a bad product, it just wasn't worth the price they wanted for it.

Man, y'all are really willing to slam anyone who says anything negative about this stuff, aren't you?"
2842,"So I know the general tone in this thread is that this was MKBHD's worst review - and yes, he is generally overly critical of Apple - but this is the first time one of his reviews made me want a product.  I did not want a 1st generation Apple Watch yesterday morning, and now I do, purely because of this video.

Yeah, he didn't cover everything, and he got some stuff straight up wrong, but he did show some things that are very relevant to people that are used to Android Wear - like how well the gryo works.  It feels like he made this review more about how well the watch works rather than the cover all of the features, which is something that's been done a million times already."
2843,seemed like a really rushed out review.....not like one of his others
2844,"Dang. I like MKBHD a lot, but this wasn't his best. Wrong about the screen technology, no mention of ANY of the health features, or even stuff like how the Complications on the watch faces let you jump into the related app. This needed to be at least another 3-4 minutes long."
2845,"That was a terrible review.

Nothing about the design or build quality, virtually nothing about health, and he hardly covered the UI, hardware features, or even the functionality of the device.

Most of his review is focused on customizability. Half the video is focused on what's customizable (watch bands and icon organization) and what's not customizable (the physical buttons and the lack of 3rd party watch faces). For such a short video, he spends most of it talking about trivial things and glosses over all the most important facets of the device.

And to top it all off, he got some major facts wrong. The screen is OLED, not LCD, and it's 326 PPI, not 290 PPI.

I like MKBHD, but that was just a terrible video. Even the production didn't seem up to his usual standards. The whole thing felt very rushed."
2846,"Apple Watch is definitely an OLED display. This seems so rushed. I love MKBHD, even though he is kind of anti-apple at times. This review isn't Patel-level bad, just not up to MKBHD's usual stuff. "
2847,"Literally MKBHD's worst review. Unorganized, blatantly wrong about the display (it is obviously an OLED and not a LCD) and he didn't say much more than someone who doesn't even have the watch would say. If I were him and wanted to keep my high reputation up I'd delete this video and reupload a better one. "
2848,All these butthurt guys with buyers remorse here defending there purchase when it just is a shit product
2849,"Reviews like this make me question how much the Apple community should really listen to or value his opinions and comments. He makes great videos and his thoughts on android are top notch. But whenever Apple is concerned it's just a very faint brush stroke compared to the effort and thought that others put into their reviews and opinions (OR even the effort he puts into his other android videos). I mean he got several obvious things blatantly wrong left out MANY major features and functionality. I get that he's speaking to an audience but we aren't it (clearly). His viewers are mostly android users- he knows that. We need to recognize that and adjust our expectations. 

I don't want to imply that you shouldn't stop watching his videos ( I won't ), but when apple is concerned his opinions are mediocre at best and should be taken lightly if not ignored. "
2850,This review made me less excited about getting an Apple Watch. Maybe I'll just get a Sport instead of an SS.
2851,What do you guys think of the laggyness of the iwatch? Is it annoying or is it ok?

2853,"You read the comments on his YouTube channel and it's mostly ""it's not the 360 or I'm not paying that much for that trash"" I thought he did a good job for the review and anything Apple he reviews seems to get trashed it's just the nature of the majority of his followers."
2854,Just wait for WWDC!
2855,"I thought the review was excellent. I love how coming here to the klan of obvious apple diehards shows nothing but hate for the guy who gave a straight up and honest review of the product. You guys claim he didn't do it justice, but he reviewed it based on his own personal use of the device. If you were supposed to use all the 'extra functionality' you get in an Apple watch, why would they put such a terrible battery in it? Obviously it's not for actually running apps on because it's only got 2-3 hours of screen on time. You guys need to chill down, I know you want to take out your wasted $350+ on someone, but Marques doesn't deserve that. BTFO."

2863,"It is frightening to read the comment in here. 
First of all MKBHD is not biased. The truth is that its an mediocre smart-watch, just because you guys have buyers remorse and need to justify wasted money on this mediocre smart-watch does not mean everybody else need to like it. MKBHD is an Apple user, he uses MacBooks, and the Mac Pro and he even built his own hackingtosh. 
And yet I find him to be one of the most unbiased reviewers on the internet, even though he still to this date, haven't reviewed ANY Microsoft products even after three generations of awesome Surface hardware!"
2864,Best review!
2865,Lol at all the butthurt fanboys ITT who believe apple can do no wrong. 
2866,apple sucks at everything
2867,"Yeah, holy fuck. I kept scrolling through the comments trying to find somebody who wasn't just riding their expensive apple watch for more than what it's worth, and all the dissenting opinions are down here. 

The people who have positive things to say about this mediocre smart watch all mention really trivial, shiny special features that Marques didn't focus on completely, as if that would suddenly make the price tag reasonable. It's a basic smart watch. Good on you if you decide to buy it, it's not like you really have a choice if you own an iphone and want a smart watch. But don't delude yourself into thinking it's the innovation of the fucking century just because ""oh shit nigga apple and heart rate monitors n shit!!!"""
2868,Nice to see an alternative POV in here
2869,"I thought so too. His videos usually have a great sense of pace, and he usually adds some unique insight. In this video, not so much."
2870,"It's rushed, and centered on useless things like watch-faces, because he doesn't want to touch the functionality and the good aspects we, watch owners, and buyers, know... like the health aspect, apple pay, voice calls, etc...

So it's ""Apple is expensive, they make you pay $700 for a watch, because you can't go for the $349/$399 models"""
2871,"""no mention of ANY of the health features"" 
[4:32](https://youtu.be/dPL1-8ypnEs?t=272)
False, he does mention fitness goals and being prompted to stand up every once in a while.


I'm pretty sure people can assume the standard features from the visuals he used. You can clearly see him swiping past calories burned, steps, exercise timer and in the beginning he used the heart rate monitor. "
2872,How unfortunate he isn't wrong about screen technology. Having an AMOLED on a watch is just horrible. The watch face will burn in after only a month or so of normal usage. AMOLED screens just deteriorate very quickly when on static images.

All the features you mention are not really that different from other smartwatches. There really are not that many things to say about the watch that makes it stand out."
2879,"butthurt much are we? Not everyone gives a fuck about your stupid build quality apple fanboyism. Watches are meant to be worn, and to look good while at it, thus the focus on customization. Why don't you complain how he didn't mention its biggest flaws like perceivable lag between glances on a $700 device, it's fat clearly non inspiring design, or how truly limited apple watch apps are in the way that they are not independent and have clear experience-breaking pauses every time you open one? Complain all you want, but he clearly sugar-coated all of it's flaws and you still have something to whine about. "

2885,"His android reviews almost always come out after all the other major review sites as he doesn't often get review units. He has the buy them. 

Most of his android reviews seem to be a short summary of the other reviews I have already read, a few real world tests, and a little opinion all in a nice video. 

His opinions aren't original, his tests are never close to scientific (""3-5 hr of heavy use most of the time""). 

But he combines info from a lot of places and puts it in an easy to swallow video. 

I rarely learn anything from his reviews other than what he thinks, but I think his reviews are generally enjoyable.

2919,All agreed. But remember what he's trying to do. Hes a YouTube not Gruber or Siracusa he's an entertainer. He's trying to get views and that's the bottom line for him. It's unfortunate that he has to pay for his units but that's the cost of being independent. Especially with his objectively sloppy reviews of Apple products I don't see why apple would bother giving him anything especially if he's going to get random facts wrong and ignore huge portions of the product.

Hopefully this fuels competition and others will do new things- but it's kind of a pathetic joke to compare the Moto 360 to even the Apple watch. 


And to be clear I think the 360 is cool and all and I would have bought one to play with if it worked with iOS- but it's very clearly a reaction to the information that apple was making a watch. They haven't put in a tenth of the time and effort that Apple has in creating that product."

I get that you want to feel good about this underwhelming and overpriced piece of gear, but thats just what it is. You have been arguing to try and make it seem that this is a revolutionary watch and better than the rest. Its pretty on par with other smartwatches, imo its just the apple alternative so the sheep can be happy. Apple watch will sell tons anyway just because of the name...regardless of features so dont worry, your $350 cheapo silicone sportwatch purchase is justifiable and you will probably get the attention you so crave.

2937,"To be fair, able to make calls on it is not the most vital thing needed - it's a nice feature, sure, but it's not for everyone as not everyone is going to walk use headphones and a loudspeaker is not a viable option. NFC payments are nice too, but they are yet to be adopted enough in the market  as a payment method - at some point, maybe, but right now it's not the thing to focus on. There is no point in focusing on functions that the common user won't even use.

And there is no plastic Android smartwatch - most, if not all of them also offer different wristbands. Largely Android smartwatches (the best ones as there are more than one) are no different in usefulness for a common user than the Apple watch. The features it lacks in comparison to Apple watch are evened out by the fact that there is much better options for customization, since that can be the only thing that can keep your smartwatch interesting. This is a good thing as you can go for what you like - in my opinion round faced watch is much better looking than a square, even if it is Apple square.

Overpriced compared to what?

The only one that's not plastic is the Asus and the unreleased Huawei, which lacks many other things, but the Moto, the LG have plastic backs, whichs suck, because they tend to crack:

Thats unfortunate bobble about the moto and LG.

No thats not a sign of how good other apple products are. Apple products are great but don't let your obsessive love for them cloud your vision. There are a lot of people who will buy anything apple just because its apple and there is no denying that. 

Where did you get the idea that silicone cost more than leather? 

> it's useful too, confortable, and great looking. 

Useful? leather is useful? plus there are silicone bands if you reallly want them. And comfortability and looks are subjective. I currently wear a lot of classic timepieces and leather is very comfortable to me so it is a matter of preference...never been a fan of silicone.

5. Other watches can connect to the phone via wifi.

The ONLY thing that is special to the apple watch is the NFC, which is cool but again, doesn't fit the price tag.

That seems like a standard notification from an app - android allows apps to push custom notifications with multiple pages, custom graphics, customizable hot areas and quick actions. 

For example, [LevelUp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scvngr.levelup.app&hl=en), a payment/rewards application that restaurants in my area use, has an android wear interface to their app.  Whenever I arrive at a restaurant that I've used LevelUp to pay at before (automatically detected with custom geofencing),  a notification shows up on my watch asking if I want to use LevelUp to pay. Like [this](https://lh4.ggpht.com/xGzv2rfktNHEHnGBhHioE0QiUa8HN5CDV0GuyZHlptPzjSNtz5Ba7OT0HZ13ccZz1kk=h900-rw#.png) I can slide it to the left and [choose the tip I want to include in the payment](https://lh5.ggpht.com/5cElkEmpBEPVwpLi2fJ8JrpGnTtl2SricZypSpaeIfS95xthN46QAS27lV3Whn5Kxw=h900-rw#.png) 

I also get notifications towards the end of the day if I haven't met my exercise goals in google fit, with a custom circular graph showing what I've done and how much more I need to do.

I also get notifications about any music or movies that's playing on my phone or my chromecast, with album art as the background and buttons to play/pause/skip forward back right on the watch. 

It really seems like android wear has all the bases covered as far as functionality and customization"

IMHO, you shouldn't trust either. Experiment for yourself.

> but android smartwatches are too.

No one is saying that tehy aren't. But currently, no Android Wear watch is as good as the Apple Watch, no watch can tick as many boxes in characteristics that are very obvious that a smart watch need or should have.

If you think that having a device that is supposed to facilitate your life and free you of taking out your phone every time, and then doesn't have voice call capabilities, can't make sounds for notifications (if you want to avoid missing), or can't do contactless payments... if you find that okay... then the fanboy is who?"

I get that they don't fit for a lot of people, but I frequently use a watch because I'm always looking at the time and I get sick of fumbling for my phone. A smart watch just improves upon it. The only negative is I have to put it on a specific part of my table at night, the positive is that I can change how it looks, see my notifications, the weather...

It's a little expensive for what it is and better products exist, but compared to a watch it does more and offers me a small but extremely frequent convenience. This is a G Watch owner btw."

What's funny is the watch isn't 700, it's considerably cheaper than that for the sport model. So there's even less credibility for the argument even with that flawed method of thinking. He's purposefully inflating the price to support the concept that the price = too high. 

Honestly I'm really happy that apple has this effect on people. It keeps out a huge number of people from their platform and their purchasing ecosystem. There's a reason every single study shows Apple users are more valuable than the much much larger number of android users."

They missed everything it was supposed to be, because the tech just isn't there.

2999,"Nope, got straight to the point."
3000,"You're thinking of /r/androidcirclejerk

Neither apple or Android sub usually straight up attack each other. On the announcement of Apple pay there was a collaborative thread discussing its push in nfc for both systems. There's always those people, but nice try. But then again I am in Apple watch sub which is clearly reserved for people who can't handle a different opinion of their purchase. "
3001,"Not much more? The moto 360 was going for $130 yesterday. And it's build is the same as the normal apple watch, not the sport. "
3002,"If I wanted a sports watch I'd get a fitbit. Which is then saving me 200.

""years ahead"" haha, okay you're one of those guys. Never mind, enjoy your watch. "
3003,"Plastic toys who aren't even full smartwatches.

No fitness capabilities, no NFC, etc...

Also, look like fake watches."
3004,you have yet to see it!
3005,"You're kidding right?

>You're thinking of /r/androidcirclejerk

You're kidding right? Because you said this in here, not ACJ

>apple users are seen as jackasses because they view themselves as superior

When there is news /r/Apple gets flooded with people posting negative stuff and one liners that get upvoted. Check any comment or submission history and it is all /r/android users who flock over to start shit. 

I have devices from both platforms and I spent a lot of time in both subreddits. 

/r/Androidcirclejerk is a joke subreddit. I find that a lot of people there occasionally do an /UJ and actually have more reasonable things to say. ACJ makes fun of /r/android more than /r/Apple.

I don't have an AW and I don't plan on getting one. But it really just seems like you are here to mostly stir up shit. 

Here are your shit stirring quotes:

> No watch is worth 700, unless you're actually going for a watch for pure aesthetic reasons

Guess what? The market says otherwise. I am guessing you are using the ""But I think it's ugly"" argument to ""prove"" it isn't with $700? You don't get it.

> I would never spend 700 dollars on this watch, and neither would many people.

Yeah, but ""many people"" isn't all people. So why sit around and tell people you think they are poorly spending their money because you think their watch isn't pretty. What a waste of time, man. You must be great at parties.

>The ONLY thing that is special to the apple watch is...

You seem to think like this is just a specs sheet. The iPhone still has 1 GB of ram, to an android users, that is a joke, but it does pretty well, better than most android flagships with 2GB of ram."
3006,"The moto 360 has the lowest res screen, slow outdated cpu even compared to android wear watches. The worst accuracy in smartwatch HR monitors.  Compromised design with flat tire look.

It debuted at $300 and is now going for $130 because it is outdated and a new one is coming out soon. Not because it is some great value product.  "
3007,"Oh so now we get to the crucial point. You don't have any sports band / fitness tracker? Have you even tried one? Because your flawed thinking seems to stem from never having even touched one of these let alone used for an extended period to understand the nuisances. That's why you think it's a price thing- because you know pretty much nothing about them.

If you think those two are comparable I don't know what to say. If you want to spend your money differently that's fine. But you're talking like you have a clue about the technology and products and you really really don't. I guess some people need to troll to feel like their opinions matter. 

Edit: also ""saving you 200 dollars""???? What the fuck are you talking about yet again? Are you completely unaware of the prices or are you just saying things. The sport is 350 what fitness band are you getting for 50 bucks? You can get some between 100 and 250 but the features are not comparable. Idk I guess it's what I get for talking to a troll. 

Edit: also it literally is years ahead. Again your objectively wrong. Android wear has been out for a while now and does not have feature parity. They are not even close in terms of build but I'll over look that. It'll be ""years"" LITERALLY before they reach feature parity. So yes the Apple watch is literally and objectively years ahead of the competition. This is fact. You're trying to pretend I hate android or android wear and you're dead wrong. I think they're both really really cool. But their products are not as good. Everyone can agree with that. With time they will hopefully catch up but right now you're the idiot fanboy who can't see what even avid android fans will admit. 

Edit: I guess it was too much to ask for reasonable comparison. Oh well. "

3009,"I'm here because I use alientube and it replaces YouTube comments with reddit. I've said many times I have absolutely no issue with the watch, I just think the price is absurd. Which apparently makes me an android fanboy even though I'm simply stating my opinion. I've read posts in /r/apple regarding the same video and people are more open to my view. It's simply because this sub is dedicated to the watch people clearly aren't looking for anything but shining reviews. I would never go out of my way to piss people off, ones who have been upset with me I simply stopped responding. 

And I meant android doesn't shit talk apple in their threads and I assume apple doesn't either. People traveling across subs talking shit are obviously rabid fan boys. Shit talking apple when something is released for android usually gets down voted because it's over done at this point. "
3010,"Yes, and their new product will be cheaper and comparable. And it debuted at 230."
3011,"I have a fitbit.

3013,"> I've said many times I have absolutely no issue with the watch, I just think the price is absurd.

You seem to think there is nothing special about it outside of NFC, that it is ugly, overpriced, has mostly features you wouldn't use, and that people who own them are jackasses.

So, that is just what I have gleaned from your responses in this one thread.

>I'm here because I use alientube and it replaces YouTube comments with reddit. 

And you seem to be matching the quality of Youtube comments, good job."
3014,"But that model isn't even close to feature comparable. Let alone the materials or design. One is very clearly and objectively better. Maybe not for everyone but that's not what your arguing. That's like saying a Toyota and a BMW are the same thing except the price. I understand they have different values and people are willing to spend different amounts of money but they are different- that's not opinion. 

You're ignoring the entire points being made against you. And again - have you ever owned or even used ANY of these products? I mean even if you say yes I'm going to have to assume you're lying or just stupid. Your overlooking basic functionality and pricing. You clearly haven't used any of these products seriously and your only concern is x product is not worth y price? 

To you I say enjoy your money. Clearly that matters more than even having a reasonable discussion let alone something that may make someone happy. I will enjoy my Apple watch. Just like I enjoyed my jawbone and Fitbit and some of the android wear watches I've been loaned by friends. The Apple watch is better right now, period. When Motorola comes out with their new watch I'll be very interested to try that too. I think you need to grow up in a lot of ways. Money isn't everything, life is short, and you should at the very least try things you're interested in. Lots of people have them now you don't even need to spend any money to get into them. 

"
3015,"Alright, the *backs* of the watches are plastic. Also that's the G Watch R, the Urbane is all metal...


And iirc Google Fit is getting an update to do all of those things."
3016,"I said I don't prefer square watches period, that's my preference it's obviously no reflection on the tech of the watch.

I said NFC is something ONLY APPLE put into their watch, it's cool but I personally don't use NFC payments.

And no, the guy who said that a high price keeps the watch exclusive to people who *blah blah blah* is the reason why people think apple users are jack asses, because of that specific mindset. Literally no correlation to the watch.

I obviously don't like the watch, that doesn't mean it isn't a good watch, which is what people apparently can't separate."
3017,"No I simply accept you're upset I don't like the watch which bothers you greatly. So I'm not going to bother continuing arguing with someone who is too thick skulled to understand. 

ENJOY YOUR WATCH for the final time. "
3018,"https://youtu.be/LulpqeGqCMg?t=4m24s

It's plastic too.

The backs are important too, cracked backs let water in, which will damage the electronics for sure.

That's why good watches are metal, even g-shocks, the internal is metal."
3019,"The issue is that you are here mostly to stir up shit, that's it. Seems like you don't have any interest in the watch, you don't like it, and for some reason you have decided to write about 20 comments on this one story to that effect.

All of these comments are just here to stir shit up. Hold up a fucking mirror to your comments, dude. 

>People traveling across subs talking shit are obviously rabid fan boys."
3020,"You keep saying enjoy your watch like you're making this final point. I don't care what you do with your money- no one does (literally). If that's what you think is going on you have issues with reading comprehension. You keep engaging me (and others) to get some final word like you've made any point - where each and every time you reply you 1) weaken your argument, 2) ignore counter points and criticism, 3) reiterate that you personally find something too expensive but then translate that to an indictment against the product and its objective superiority. You spend no time discussing the merits of technology or design, implementation, anything. All that matters to you is price, which we all get and no one cares about. 

>> ENJOY YOUR WATCH for the final time. 

oh so this is the final time I'll be hearing this childish refusal to either give up or engage intellectually? Great. Now maybe you can either stop responding (like a kid trying desperately to get the last word) or provide something with even a shred of thought or value to what is a community discussion. You want to just pop in and say I disagree? Fine. But then also kindly fuck off afterward. 

Also, i still don't understand the ""enjoy your watch"" comment as if I'm not open to, have not tried and do not own alternatives and competitors that even you yourself recommend. You don't really know my situation or if I even have or am getting an Apple watch for sure. I use all technology and I think it's worth discussing, trying, and experiencing variety. You clearly have an apple = bad thing to work through that's making you reason like a child. Bottom line is if you think you're sticking it to me by pretending that I only blindly use Apple products you're wrong.

Enjoy getting upset because you personally don't like something but can't accept that other people do and want to talk about more than personal preference and discuss things that are more important as technology advances. Please just grow up or go to a sub that better reflects your opinions. "
3021,"Well, I stand corrected. But I still don't agree that they're toys. No more than the Apple Watch, at least."
3022,"Except those are all replies to people attacking my opinion. Sorry I wasn't nice to them, think what you want."
3023,"They are toys, because no matter what you chose, you are getting an incomplete device.

Pick one, and then we'll talk why they are toys."
3024,"Most of what you say seems to be goading people on, laughing, calling people jackasses. 

>Oh, this is just my opinion? I had no idea when I posted what I thought on the internet. Grow up you rabid fan boy

That is just backlash, none of that has anything to do with actually defending your opinion. The list of reasons after it DO. But the manner in which you conduct yourself overshadows almost anything you have to say.

Your contempt for the people who want to ""enjoy their watch"" shines through, not only when you are telling them to go ""enjoy there watch"" but especially then."
3025,"Yup, because read the guy arguing with me, it's very much a proper attitude to take. Like I said if you don't agree it's no skin off my back, I'm not going to be nice to ass holes which all of my responses were directed at. "
3026,"You can say that, but when all of your comments are directed at assholes and your comments are attracting assholes and then that is your excuse for your own comments reading like a ""rabid fanboy"" then it is easy to draw conclusions about what is going on."
3027,"Haha, I made a comment saying his video was to show whether or not it's worth 700 and I agree it isn't. Then the rage ensued, again I shared my opinion, people got upset and I responded accordingly. Whether or not you agree I really couldn't care less. Have a nice day. "
3028,"> his video was to show whether or not.. 

And a lot of people here watch a lot of his videos and think this video as under informed and left out a lot of details. In some cases he got his specs just wrong.

So when you quantify something's value, and you don't really even seem to get your facts right about the product or test / talk about most of the compelling features, it is easy to say that video isn't a great review or representation of the product.

Also, build materials are all that separates this from a $350 watch, it is weird to not even discuss the build materials and judge it as a $700 Watch alone.

It just isn't the whole story."
3029,"I agree, and I even stated that other places got the specs wrong as well so I don't know where the miscommunication came from. But I don't see enough function, even with things are saying in this thread, that would justify 700 dollars for me. That's just my honest opinion. I wouldn't even purchase the Moto 360 because of its lack of functionality for 230. I'm waiting for later gens of watches to be released, then I'll look into purchasing one."
3030,Anyone having problem with the battery? It doesn‚Äôt even last a full day for me
3031,It does give the option to turn off the always on display. Maybe a software update will fix the battery problems
3032,"I have been very unimpressed w battery life. 

I jumped from a 3 to the 5 and I‚Äôm actually returning the 5 today.  

The always on, larger screen, and comparable battery life just weren‚Äôt enough for me to justify the upgrade."
3033,7:30a to 8p today and my S5 is at 47%. That‚Äôs with a couple workouts and checking notifications.
3034,7am to 8:30pm and my series 5 is at 43% battery at the moment
3035,Mine is  lasting as advertised as well.
3036,"For those of you getting shit battery life:
Do a hard reset of both the watch and the phone.  Made my battery life back to normal."
3037,"Some of the comments here about battery life have really surprised me. I have a series 3, cellular, that can go literal days without being charged. Use every single day. But this ones not even getting through a day of use? I‚Äôd rather just keep my 3 lol."
3038,Weird that my 3-year old series 2 watch seems to be registering battery battery life than a brand new Apple Watch.
3039,Can you change the screen to not be always on?
3040,"WatchOS 6 is amazing. 

I have a Series 4. I am phoneless at the moment because I sold my iPhone to get the new Max Pro. So, I'm waiting for it. It's amazing how independent the watch became with WatchOS 6. I receive messages through Wifi, I can play anything from Apple Music, etc."
3041,"I have to charge it daily at this point cause if I don't I will have to enter power reserve mode the next-day, drains nearly 60% throughout day and the standby time is awful. I'm going to try exchanging it and seeing if anything improves. If not, it's back to the series 4 for me. It sucks cause I find the compass very handy."
3042,"I've noticed that on my Series 5, sometimes the screen will be black and I have to tap it for the screen to wake up. I have it on the always on setting so I'm certain that's not supposed to happen. Is anyone else having this problem?"
3043,"Fortunately, I've found the battery life to be as advertised with my device. Usually put it on at 5:30 am and wear it until 10:00 pm and have had no issue with having plenty of battery to spare (30ish%). I would classify myself as a moderate user (workout in the morning, notifications at work throughout the day)."
3044,"What size watch?  

I love my Series 4 44mm, the battery lasts two days!  I'll gladly give up the always on display if it means two days of battery life"
3045,"I don't know if it's a problem or if it's by design, but my S5 battery life could definitely be better. It gives me roughly the same battery life as my old S1 (running watchOS 5). I have AOD enabled, but people are reporting that even with it disabled, the battery life is not significantly changed."
3046,"When I got my first Apple Watch, a Series 3, my average use went like this:

* I used the watch throughout the day.

* I'd go to sleep with it on.

* The next morning, I would place it on the charger before hopping in the shower and getting ready for work.

* It drained so little during the past day, it would always be charged to **100%** by the time I got it off the charger.

* After taking it off the charger on Friday morning, it would last all day Friday, Saturday, and into Sunday. 

With my new Apple Watch Series 5, my average use goes like this:

* I *refrain* from using the watch throughout the day (as I know it will drain the battery faster).

* Battery is still down to 30% by the time I get to bed, and drains even more while I sleep.

* I get the 10% warning in the morning, and place it on the charger before showering and getting ready for work.

* When I take the watch off the charger, the battery is only to only up to 50%-60%. So I *know* it won't even make it the rest of the day.



I'm not trying to do anything special with the watch. I'm not playing games or reading the news or doing much with it."
3047,The battery is really bad. I get home with like 30% battery and I'm a light user. On my series 3 I can come home with something like 60% battery. I consider this a massive downgrade.
3048,Do you have auto stop/start workout on? I had terrible battery when I got mine with those enabled.
3049,"I had issues when the OSes were out of sync meaning watch os5 and iOS 13 beta. Since they are both on the latest and greatest, no. Try rebooting both devices. If that doesn‚Äôt work unpair and pair. Could be some shitty apps too. I run my watch pretty lean without many apps because I really don‚Äôt think any of them are good."
3050,Did you set up as new or restore from backup? Try erasing it and setting it up as new :)
3051,"Same. I put it on at about 645 am and by 5 pm it‚Äôs at 55% and then I go to the gym and an hour to 2 hours, it‚Äôs down to 35%. And that‚Äôs by 7 pm. 

My series 2 would go through the whole day and be at 70% when I went to sleep at 1030 pm"
3052,First day with mine. 6:30 am to 10 pm and 13% left. Exactly the advertised hours. Maybe I'll turn off the always ok for long days like this.
3053,Mine doesn‚Äôt last the 2 days that it used to on WatchOS 5. I usually have to charge it every night or the next morning.
3054,"If you decide to get t exchanged or replaced, turn off heart rate monitor until you do and it‚Äôll last way longer."
3055,Strange. I pick up mine at 5am and I had 35% left at 10pm
3056,"I‚Äôm at 17 hours standby, 1 hour screen on, and 51% 

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Though I‚Äôve mostly been experiencing ~18-24 hours prior to today so idk why today it‚Äôs so high. 

It‚Äôs been about as advertised."
3057,I didn‚Äôt think the series 4 was impressive to start. I pretty much have to charge every twenty four hours.
3058,[deleted]
3059,"interesting. i did the same upgrade and to me the larger, rounded screen makes an insane difference. the watch seems so much bigger and easier to interact with. but ye, if its not enough for you the 3 still is perfectly fine."
3060,Always on enabled?
3061,Do you use your watch for workouts? And do you have it on all day?
3062,Yes. It‚Äôs in the Display & Brightness options in Settings.
3063,You can turn off the always-on display.
3064,Mines been dying at around 8pm. Put it on at 6am. Kind of bummed.
3065,"Basically the same exact battery life as I have been getting, which is actually better than the advertised 18 hrs."
3066,That‚Äôs it? I wear my series 2 and get about an hour of tracked exercise in yet I finish the day with 70% battery left. That always on screen must be horrific for battery life.
3067,Oh. That‚Äôs basically like mine then. Is that the usual?
3068,I could make it from 5:15am to 9pm (always on enabled) if it weren't for tracking workouts.  I have to toss it on the charger prior to my evening run for the battery to last the full day.
3069,"Same boat for me. S4 owner. I put it on around 530 AM and take it off around 10 PM. My watch is almost always still around 60 - 70% when I go to charge at night. I workout multiple times a day, use timers constantly, check notifications, watch my activity app progress, etc. The only problem I'm having with OS6 is a lag in the screen reacting to my touch when checking it periodically, and that's not even every time.. Just needs a patch update!"
3070,"Reset it from new. I had the same issue when I upgraded from the series 3 to 4, and resetting it to factory default it completely fixed the problem."
3071,"Same experience here except I‚Äôm coming from a series 4. I‚Äôm starting to regret upgrading. Apple advertises it as being the same battery life as a series 4 even with the screen always on, but so far that doesn‚Äôt seem true at all."
3072,[deleted]
3073,"If I set it up as new, will it still recover my previous activity/workouts?"
3074,Do you have AOD activated? If not then those numbers aren't surprising. Very close to what I would get on my Series 3.
3075,"The 13.1 update for my iPhone XS has seemingly improved my Series 5 battery life by a fair bit. Nowhere near the 2-3 day battery life I had with my Series 3, but it's something."
3076,Bugs in iOS affect watchOS battery life.
3077,"Yes. I‚Äôm on the 13.1 beta too if that matters. First Apple Watch so I don‚Äôt have any experiences to compare it to.

Edit: 40mm and GPS version"
3078,"I have a 3 and I find it pretty variable depending on how much exercise (high activity but not in workout mode) or workouts I do. 

I use it for sleep tracking, so typically it only gets charged during my morning routine plus for a few minutes before I go to sleep. If it was a high-activity day, I usually see 30-40% after waking up. 60-70% percent after waking up if it was a low-activity day."
3079,"I sleep in my watch tbh. I track my sleep with it, I have sleep troubles. It never comes off besides showers and any water activities. I normally charge it every 3 days. I use voice text, gps, podcast app, and a few more literally every day."
3080,Then whats the point in upgrading?
3081,[deleted]
3082,[deleted]
3083,"I'm just a casual observer here with an old Series 1 watch (that definitely doesn't last an entire day), but I can't help commenting here.

You're upset that you put your watch on in the morning at 5:30, workout with it, use it for notifications and random things throughout the day, and take it off at 10pm with roughly 30% battery left? This isn't good enough? I haven't looked into what Apple claims the battery life to be but damn that sounds like a dream to me. AND it has an always on screen? I should probably upgrade before I cream myself over here."
3084,Are on on the gps or lte version?
3085,"I used to get this kind of battery life on my S4 with the same kind of usage pattern, but that all tanked after installing the first iOS 13 beta (not even watchOS beta) and it never improved."
3086,Yea that‚Äôs it
3087,"If you have iCloud sync on for it, yes."
3088,if you're syncing all of your health data to iCloud then yes.
3089,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just the series 5. I went from a Series 3 to a series 4 and it‚Äôs really annoying how much worse the battery is. I get the new watches are doing a lot more and such, but if I want my new watch to last two days, I need to put it in power saver mode over night to keep the battery alive. That wasn‚Äôt needed with the series 3"
3090,Why still on the beta?  The official release of 13.1 is out now.
3091,"With iOS 13, I get 95% when I woke up in the morning, and with iOS 13.1, I get 72% on wake up. ffs"
3092,"lol. 

Well for the first if you forget to put it on the charger it dies very early into the second day. In the latter it goes clear through the second day and partly into the third from the last time charged. That seems like a fairly intuitive issue."
3093,My series 2 has 70% left at 16 hours on my wrist and I do all those things to. It sounds like the series 5 is a major step backwards for battery life.
3094,I feel your pain. I had a series 1 before getting a 4 and I can tell you the difference is amazing. The watch no longer lags and acts slow like my old one did. I almost creamed myself the first time using it. And for once I‚Äôm not jealous of the next watch! My 4 isn‚Äôt a whole lot different than the 5 thank god. An always on screen would be nice but for me it isn‚Äôt a necessity.
3095,You are responding to the wrong person.
3096,"LTE I take calls on it too, but not frequently. Only when Im on runs and don't have my phone w me."
3097,"I'm hoping the patches drop soon. There are some quality issues, but the battery life hasn't been affected on either of my devices... yet!"
3098,Awesome. Thanks!
3099,"Well I guess I‚Äôm on the GM version now, but I‚Äôm a perpetual beta user so I kept my profile so I‚Äôll get the next beta that comes out."
3100,"I don't forget to place it on its charger and don't (and would never care to) wear it to bed. Non issues for me.

I'll take the 5 over a series 2 any day of the week. LOL."
3101,"I‚Äôve been seriously missing out then, wow! I didn‚Äôt realize the battery life was that good.

For the S5, I think someone mentioned it might be due to a buggy iOS 13? I hope that‚Äôs the case and Apple can sort it out."
3102,Yeah it definitely seems like I should upgrade this year. I‚Äôve been holding onto this S1 waiting for it to finally die but it just won‚Äôt! Haha.
3103,Exactly the same thoughts as you. I upgraded from a Series 0.
3104,"https://i.imgur.com/zRQWLvD.jpg

I responded correctly on my end.

Edit: To be more clear, I was just using the example that was given by a previous commenter since the person I responded to said he wasn‚Äôt happy with similar battery life."
3105,Damn that‚Äôs pretty good. I had a 4lte that I returned and got a 3lte for $259. Was a mistake and now I can‚Äôt get the color/band I like. Might just settle on color though because that battery life is way better and I‚Äôll likely keep it for a long time. Did you use a 3? My pr seems to be inaccurate often.  The hr sensor on the 4 seems to be a lot better too.
3106,I had that on a couple of the betas. I‚Äôm on the normal release of 13.1 and it‚Äôs been normal again.
3107,It‚Äôs true! Mine still works fine but is sitting in my drawer all lonely now üôÅ
3108,I reread the comments and I see that I was wrong. The wording confused me because it seemed like you were responding to the guy putting it on at 5:30.

3111,"The series 4 was my introduction to smart watches. I'm glad I bought in too. At first I was skeptical but I love mine. Tbf I'm sure the measurements aren't always entirely accurate, but they've made me more aware of how active I am which has benefited me greatly. One thing I question is the accuracy of distance when running. When I map my runs with 3rd party apps, my daily run is slightly farther than what the apple watch registers. Not a big deal, but an interesting insight. I'd love to verify who is more accurate."
3112,"It all made so much sense in my head at the time. But looking back through it now that I‚Äôm not at work and distracted, I can see where I made it confusing."
3113,Looks correct on my screen and in their screenshot
3114,"His comment was fine. The only guy complaining about his obviously great battery life is the guy OP responded to

I seriously don‚Äôt get why everyone seems to be struggling to follow"
3115,"I noticed the same thing compared to my old Garmin. I read that to get the run started right away, Apple watches guess for the first bit while it acquires signal. 

And yea same. My Apple Watch replaced 3 devices. Running watch, regular watch, and a smart watch I used solely for sleep tracking. It‚Äôs my second smart watch but the first one I actually use. The s4 is where it‚Äôs at."
3116,[deleted]
3117,So would it have made you feel better if he threw in some ‚Äúroughly‚Äùs or ‚Äúaround‚Äùs? ben dover said that stuff basically matches his day. And was complaining about battery life. The guy originally saying 5:30 and 10 and 30% was talking about how that stuff is great. It makes no sense that my snow day would be responding to him
3118,[deleted]
3119,At this point there‚Äôs really no reason to continue but I just feel the need to say I get what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm saying that the people who misunderstood are dum dums who can‚Äôt follow a basic conversation
3120,[deleted]
3121,"I just got home from work and was planning on editing my comment all to hell and back. But I see you‚Äôve done a lot of the work for me. Thanks!

(Yes, my original post was not effectively worded at all.)"
3122,"I like my S5 so far, but I upgraded from an S2."
3123,Went from a series 0 to series 5. I love the watch. Seems like it‚Äôs not worth the update for series 4(or even series 3) owners but that‚Äôs expected.
3124,"So I was planning to upgrade my S3 GPS only to an S5 LTE mainly because obviously LTE and the Always On but know I'm not sure, S5 Owners what is your experience with battery life with Always On enabled so far?

EDIT: Thanks for all the info guys! I'm probably gonna buy one but I'll have to check if I go for GPS or LTE. ;)"
3125,This video just makes me even more glad I stuck with the S4.
3126,"Keep in mind usage case. Mkbhd is a heavy user, uses an LTE model, does multiple workouts, is essentially a celebrity (lots of notifications), and uses full brightness even when not necessary. His battery disappointment with AOD is not a surprise. 

It should not surprise anyone that there is a real difference when you turn off the AOD. No matter how advanced LTPO may or may not be, you're still powering on a display all day. And Apple's AOD watchfaces are in color with lots of detail unlike other smartwatches AODs that do a crippled ambient mode. 

To me, the tradeoff is totally worth it. I want my watch to be a watch, which means I can always see the date and time without having to gesture for it."
3127,"So basically ‚Äúif you have a series 4 and don‚Äôt give a damn about always on screen, skip this one‚Äù."
3128,"I‚Äôm new to the AW and I was genuinely disappointed with the battery life after a few days. I assumed indexing would take a hit on the first few days but after that, I still saw a 30% hit when having the Always On Display turned on. I‚Äôd leave work with <20% and be anxious it wouldn‚Äôt make the whole day.

I‚Äôve since turned it off and I‚Äôm lying in bed after 14 hours after taking it off the charger with exactly 50%, after 3 short workouts on separate occasions. It‚Äôll track my sleeping and I‚Äôll put it on charge while I get ready in the morning.
Overall I‚Äôm very happy with the watch, but I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs anything worth upgrading over if you have a series 3 or 4.
I hope Apple release an update which can fix some of the battery issues with the screen or else I won‚Äôt bother keeping it on"
3129,"A lot of younger reviewers seem to miss the point that an always on display finally makes the Apple Watch function like a real watch. 

Sure it‚Äôs not a flashy or particularly exciting new feature. But it‚Äôs the hole in the Apple Watch that‚Äôs been missing from day one."
3130,"I can get through the entire day easily. I charge it in the evening after work for a little while and in the morning when I get ready for work. It never went in power saving mode for me since I got it. 

I upgraded from the S4 and it was well worth it for me since the AOD was a thing I was waiting for since day one. And I absolutely love it. Makes it look like a watch instead of just a wrist computer."
3131,How is the bluetooth sync to store your music on your watch with the series 5? Any better? I'd like to be able to sync new podcast when it's charging overnight. Can it do this easily?
3132,"The AOD is absolutely crucial to me. As a first-time watch-wearer in 10+ years I find myself always glancing at my watch without raising my wrist. For those who think AOD is useless, I feel like they might have just been gotten used to the older AW models. I can't imagine someone switching from a physical watch for example to think AOD is not helpful."
3133,I think I'm just going to stick with my s4
3134,Honestly i haven‚Äôt had the battery life issue he‚Äôs describing in the video. I got my series 5 40mm last week and everyday after normal usage I still have about 45-50 percent leftover.
3135,"I thoroughly enjoyed your review and comments about the Apple Watch series 5.
This is my first comment on any reddit communities and I wish to give you a little insight to my first smart watch I got a week ago.
I really enjoy how connected this is and how seemingly it has been integrated in to my life and how little I have had to think about it‚Äôs battery life.
So far I‚Äôve used the gps tracker on my walks around the block with my dog, I‚Äôve answered phone calls and responded to text messages from my wrist like a (secret agent) boss and with the heart rate monitor it‚Äôs able to provide me my sleeping patterns on some other apps on my iPhoneX which is something I need to get better about when I travel for work. 
Flying on a major airline across the country this week I noticed I was the only person with the boarding pass on my wrist (Qscan code) which was really handy because I did not have a printed boarding pass to lose. 
I‚Äôm not going to lie to you though; in your review you said you would probably not use the compass app. I was surprised how many times I have used it in a weeks time! 
Perhaps because I am from Colorado and folks always be checking how high they are and I did just that on a several mile hike I made in the woods! I thought it was awesome to see my elevation on my wrist during the hike and in a Boeing 737.

Peace and love,

Dio"
3136,"""being able to look at the time when I'm typing""....yeah, that's what I do... but I just look at my laptop top-right corner time, no need for an always on display :)"
3137,This dude is crazy. I put my watch on at 7am it‚Äôs now midnight and I‚Äôm at 48%
3138,"Loving my watch so far. came from the S1 and it was a huge difference in speed. I am not sure if it was worth a $400 upgrade, and honestly it was hard to justify considering the watch will be ""outdated"" in just a year, unlike real watches. 

All in all, great watch but hella expensive."
3139,"I am really interested in the Always On Display and I had my series 4 Nike Edition with one month warranty left. I sold it for 75% of the actual price on craigslist. I had used it for 11 months and it had a small blemish on the front of the casing. I think it makes a lot of sense: I will get to buy a brand new Series 5 (I am waiting for the Nike Edition to be available) with another 1-year warranty for 25% of the price, worth the expense.

As long as the battery life almost about the same as S4 (I use GPS only version), I will be super happy to get that AOD."
3140,"It would be really nice if they could add a variable refresh rate. I wouldn‚Äôt suspect any usability decrease by being able to choose a far lower refresh rate say once every five or 10 seconds or even 30 to 60 seconds. Granted, I don‚Äôt know much about displays and how the drivers work for that, so that may not even be possible. Seems like that would be a welcome upgrade either through software, or in the future S6.ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº"
3141,"I‚Äôm new to the AW and I got suckered into getting the S5 (gps/cellular), I‚Äôve had it for about a week and the battery life isn‚Äôt too bad on it. I wear it everyday starting at 6am till about bed time (10pm-11pm) and run two workouts that are about an hour and thirty minutes each during the days. It‚Äôs currently 9:30pm and I‚Äôm at 65 percent. I‚Äôm on watchOS 6.0 and I leave my watch charged overnight. It‚Äôs not bad in my opinion but I‚Äôve been hearing I could‚Äôve been on the same carrier but with series 3 for much cheaper, I don‚Äôt even use the always on display really. Still a good first watch imo."
3142,"Uh, nevermind...."
3143,"I have an S1 and I‚Äôve been wanting the S5 but based off of everything I see here, should I get the S4 instead??"
3144,Yah I have an S1 and can barely hold a charge through a day at Disneyland. Think I‚Äôll be upgrading very very soon
3145,"I understand that there's no point in upgrading from S3 to S5, but the new watchface is so beautiful that there's no choice."
3146,"I dunno If I should get the series 4 or 5.
In my country the s4 retails for $500 and series 5 is $630, that's a $130 difference, both 44mm GPS only.
AOD is mildly important to me, but battery life is a must, which one is best in your opinion?"
3147,Good time to get the S4 if the price drops. My colleague has one and has 4 days of battery.
3148,"S5 has been much better than my S2 or S3 (can‚Äôt remember which one I had briefly). 

The battery is terrible though. That‚Äôs really my only complaint. The bigger screen and smaller bezels make such a difference for me. 

Actually one more small complaint. I do wish Apple would give 3rd party apps some creative control over watch faces. But it‚Äôs a fine line to walk. If you‚Äôve ever owned an android and android watch.. then you know what an absolute mess it is trying to find a decent watch face in the play store. 

They advertise this cool face, but if you want weather, paywall, color options, paywall , etc etc . It‚Äôs a mess. It‚Äôs the Call of Duty of app stores. Micro transaction greed"
3149,"Not a ""tradeoff"", more like there are issues that need to be worked out."
3150,Looks like a white nike sport band don‚Äôt see it on apples site. Anyone know where to find it?
3151,"I went from an s4 space tray to s5 stainless with cellular.  Mainly because my work was already paying the 10 bucks for a cellular android tablet I didn't use.  

If you have a s4, I'd definitely stick with it, it's basically the same except AOD."
3152,"And here I am, still rocking my S0"
3153,TWiT has talked about it. It‚Äôs a new low frequency protocol that will allow to to locate people and things inside buildings. Apple will be coming out with tags like Tile that use the U1.
3154,I went from S4 to S5 and loving every minute of it. AOD is a game changer for my work use. Battery life has been amazing. I finish the day with 60-70%
3155,I‚Äôm mistaken the U1 chip is in the new phones. The watch will be able to access the U1 through the phones. Next years watch will probably have the U1 chip.
3156,"Was hyped for the always on but now having second thoughts. I dunno, the fact that it's always on looks too...tech bro. Always-off seems sleeker, more fashionable, blends better with outfits."
3157,So should I get the stainless series 4 for $589 USD refurbished from Apple or should I go with the 5 for $749. I am upgrading from an original generation Apple Watch.
3158,Imagine ruining your Apple Watch with that knockoff band
3159,"Same here, went from an S2 to the Titanium S5 and good god it‚Äôs a night & day difference."
3160,"Same. My Digital Crown stopped working on my S2 which finally pushed me to upgrade, but now that I have the S5, I realize I can actually use the watch for convenience. My S2 was so slow that I basically only used it for time and activity tracking."
3161,"AOD was a huge feature for me and I couldn't resist having the ceramic again, so S4 to S5 was worth it to me."
3162,"AOD is cool, but just as cellular was a major battery drain on the S3, so it was better to wait for the S4, I think this first iteration is worth skipping unless you upgrade every year.
No matter the refresh rate, it's still powering many LEDs all day."
3163,"Everything he said about s5 was true, for the first few days. With updates, my watch has gotten significantly better. The other day I ended the day with 50% no disabled apps. It‚Äôs very hot or miss. 

The only issue I have and I have suggested this to Apple is to make the display turn off completely in complete darkness. I don‚Äôt need the the display always on when it‚Äôs covered by my sleeve or at night while I‚Äôm in bed. 

Another thing is, I use my watch all the time. The only time it‚Äôs off my wrist is when I shower. I keep it on all the time even when sleeping and I have 0 issues with the battery."
3164,"Had my watch on my wrist since 21 hour ago (tracking sleep didn't drain battery that much to be fair), 34%.

Watch battery was buggy as shit on 6.0 though (3 instances of draining 100% in 3 hrs in 2 weeks). Haven't had issue since updating to 6.0.1."
3165,The first few days my battery was pretty meh.  Nothing better than my s3.  As of now I think the battery has stabilized. Currently at 68%  and it‚Äôs been 10 hours since I left my house.
3166,Had it last 20 hours barely doing anything. Also had it drop from 100% to 79% using LTE GPS in literally 5 mins
3167,"Honestly don‚Äôt see the appeal of LTE after having it for a few weeks now. Other than that I love the S5. If you are taking calls or want texts away from your phone then LTE is worth it, otherwise GPS does everything you‚Äôd need normally imo.  I haven‚Äôt had similar battery issues and usually make it through a 12-15 hour day with 20-30% left which is totally fine for me as I charge my watch at night. This includes a work out a day as well."
3168,"I would hold out and see what S6 brings in a years time. 

I just picked up a S3 and I think you are getting 90% of the enjoyment for 50% of the price. 

Having said that, if I was an older person I would 100% upgrade to get the ECG and Fall Detection. Those are big deals."
3169,"Generally, about 50% left after working a 9-5 with moderate usage. Probably about 35-40% left before I go to bed at midnight with heavier usage I‚Äôm the evening. Can wear it through the night, but rarely do. Easily could last 24 hours."
3170,"Updates have improved battery life for me. I also went through to make sure I had my notification settings set up as I like them which probably helped a bit too. 

I‚Äôm at 34% right now after 14 hours"
3171,I am at 61% with 12 hrs 12 min standby and 2 hrs 6 min usage. Wore it all day at work. That‚Äôs with AOD enabled.
3172,From the S3 it‚Äôs definitely worth an upgrade.
3173,[deleted]
3174,"Yeah, if I had a S4 there was no way I would have considered a S5.  That being said, going from a dirty S1, I appreciate the extra storage (did not get LTE) and the AOD."
3175,Lol same thoughts
3176,Sorry if you don‚Äôt know the answer to this but you have me curious. I have an S3 LTE and use it all the time for workouts so I don‚Äôt have to carry my phone while I‚Äôm out running (30-40 miles/week with music). I love my watch but I feel like us S3 owners got shafted on some awesome faces. I don‚Äôt care about AOD so I would probably keep it off but if the S4 is almost the same as the S5 for battery life and faces then I‚Äôd rather save the money for that. I‚Äôm more interested in the fall detection (I have epilepsy) so I‚Äôm stuck in this weird spot that idk what‚Äôs the best option. Based on this do you think the S4 would be sufficient?
3177,I‚Äôm glad to have picked up a S4 now that it got cheaper. Hopefully S6 will be a noticeable upgrade next year.
3178,"That‚Äôs fine just know his battery claims aren‚Äôt bullshit and the AOD is rad.

Edit- I meant to say are bullshit"
3179,"Ive never had an Apple watch before, but mine is at maybe 30% by the end of the day and that includes maybe 1-2 hrs of cycling. Only thing I have off is the noise notification stuff. The battery wasn't great the first day, but after the software upgrade it was nice."
3180,"That‚Äôs bizarre because I‚Äôm sitting here with 36% battery on my S5 after wearing it for 11 hours, a 35 minute workout, and a 70 minute workout.

I hit <20% more frequently than I did when I used my S2, but I‚Äôve never left work (I.e. wearing it for 8-10 hours) with it at <20% already.

I put it on at 7 or 8am fully charged and wear it all day. And I charge it at night while I‚Äôm in bed."
3181,Have you update to the latest WatchOS? That made a big improvement with my battery life.
3182,"I‚Äôm on the s5, took it off the charger 11 hours ago and am at 52%. AOD on but no work outs today. It can last a full 24 hours for me, and it does. I charge every morning when I wake up & am getting ready and that‚Äôs the only time it changes."
3183,"Something on macrumors had it saying people were complaining about battery life, so I think Apple is probably aware."
3184,"> I‚Äôm new to the Apple Watch ...

Follow by a very well researched and thought out comment. Did hell freeze over?! 

This is meant as a compliment by the way. Normally new Apple Watch users in this sub ask very basic low effort questions or make ignorant comments."
3185,"If you leave work with less than 20%, something is wrong with your watch, you have t updated, or you‚Äôre using it constantly.

I use mine pretty decently regularly during the day and don‚Äôt leave work with less than 50% ever."
3186,I‚Äôm at 15 hours off the charger right now with always on enabled and I‚Äôm also at 50%
3187,Do you have raise to wake on? With the always on display I turned that feature off and have found battery life to be much better that way. It‚Äôs also helpful to use less complications on the face you use wherever possible.
3188,Upvotes are cool guys but does anyone have some insight here?
3189,I got my S5 on launch and I‚Äôve been using Overcast without any issues. No watch before that so I can‚Äôt speak to previous models. watchOS 6.0.1.
3190,"That's exactly why the always-on display isn't important to me. There are clocks everywhere, and in the few instances there isn't a clock around, I have to raise my wrist to see my watch anyway, so it defeats the purpose."
3191,"My Nike series 5 has been ending the day off with ~40% from moderately heavy use 7 am through midnight-ish. I have AOD and ambient noise monitoring all on and I‚Äôll workout most days, check notifications, mark emails read constantly, etc. I have been thoroughly impressed with the battery life. 

Easily on par if not better than the series 3 I upgraded from in terms of battery life. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if the cellular models drain a little more. Either way I think I‚Äôll see how much better it gets without noise monitoring cause I don‚Äôt really need that. Always on display is clutch on the other hand though."
3192,Well there wouldn‚Äôt be any real difference in usage. The display on s5 goes down to one refresh per second(which could technically handle a ticking second hand). But while using the watch it goes back to its native refresh which is what gives it that smooth animation.
3193,Agree with this!
3194,It sucks that they don‚Äôt let every user get the new watch faces. I refuse to pay just for some faces.
3195,"Battery life depends heavily on how you use the watch. If I only use my S3 as a watch, I can get well into a third day. If I work out, listen to music, etc, I usually have to charge it every other day. or even overnight."
3196,"Yup, now at 14% at 21:20, been on since 06:00 and done a 15min workout. 

Looking forward to the S5 though, should last another 5 years at least."
3197,Do u want AOD? If not then 4. If u want to shell out the extra cash and want AOD then s5.
3198,"For <$200 I think I'd go with the S5. AOD (which you can always turn off it it's too much of a detriment), larger battery and a newer (read: new) product that will most likely be supported for slightly longer."
3199,Still rocking my S1 here. Probably gonna pick up a S5 after I graduate cause mine has become incredibly slow. At least compared to the new ones.
3200,Do you have the Space Black version or the grey version? How about the scratches? Just thinking about buying the titanium version but I have seen that is the most easy to scratch.
3201,What is it that you enjoy now? Just curious because i'm on an S2 and i wonder what i would do more with an S5.
3202,"I have aluminum, what‚Äôs the allure to ceramic? Just aesthetic?"
3203,"I mean clearly if you can afford a ceramic watch the question of ""is the upgrade worth it"" doesn't really apply to you. I think they were saying it's not worth the upgrade for people on a budget"
3204,"I second this. I also changed from series 4 gold SS to series 5 ceramic. If ceramic had been available in series 4, I would have gotten one. Always on display (AOD) was one of the major reasons I upgraded since I really wanted my AW behaves as a normal watch. The second reason was ceramic. I love the color and the most scratch resistance material."
3205,Theatre Mode will disable Always On. I use this at night.
3206,The older person argument is invalid for me since I'm under 20 anyway. ;)
3207,"As someone who upgraded from an S3 to an S5... I agree. The S5 is *absolutely* a fair bit nicer in a bunch of ways. But apart from those health features you mentioned, yeah, it's nothing essential IMO.

(though, I went GPS>GPS, so if [TheYann](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheYann/) wants to go LTE, might be more worth upgrading at the same time rather than going S3>S3)."
3208,"I think the internals are mostly the same, apparently same silicone. Just always on display, compass, slightly larger battery, double the storage."
3209,"I did my own comparison with both watches for a week straight before choosing the S4. The S5‚Äòs AOD feature was very attractive, but here are a few areas where the S4 outperformed the S5:

1. Battery life - with AOD on, the S5 didn‚Äôt last as long for all of the 7 days. I consistently ended the night with 20% less battery on the S5. I feel like this isn‚Äôt a complete dealbreaker, but battery life is more important to me than AOD.
2. Under the same lighting conditions, the S4 was noticeably brighter than the S5. They‚Äôre both rated at 1000 nits, but the ambient light sensor on the S5 was overly aggressive for my taste. 
3. When raising to wake, the S5 had a noticeably longer lag before fully lighting up.

These are minor differences, but ultimately I got a much better price for the S4 so I kept that instead. No regrets. Can‚Äôt go wrong with either one though."
3210,My theory is the S4 was supposed to do AOD but the display unevenness at low brightness meant they pulled the feature.
3211,Upgrading from S3 or older? Get the S5. Already have the S4? Hold.
3212,As a series 2 owner I am not disappointed at all - maybe I could have got an S4 but this watch is such an upgrade I have no buyers remorse. The AOD is nicer than I was expecting but the upgrade between the S2 and S5 is massive
3213,"I was coming from S3 and was dead set on the series 5, but after it didn't have sleep tracking and didn't even have a new processor, I just got a used 4 for half the price"
3214,"It was also a great upgrade from the series 3!  Screen size alone made it worth it, but the always on is nice to have for workouts for sure."
3215,I have S5 and I can tell you first Hand there‚Äôs hardly a difference in battery life having the display on or off. Maybe 20-30 mins at most.
3216,"If you don‚Äôt need AOD, then the S4 would definitely be sufficient. The S5‚Äôs main upgrades are the AOD, built in compass, and 32gb storage (vs 16). Everything else is essentially the same, including processor speed. If you could find it for significantly cheaper than than the S5, I highly recommend it."
3217,"on 6.0,.1 his battery claims are defo shit."
3218,"Can confirm, going on 13 hours on my S5 rn at 44% with AOD on all day."
3219,Same. I‚Äôm at 59% after 11.5 hours off the charger.
3220,"I have indeed!

Unfortunately, it broke my Audible app in the process ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It can‚Äôt sync books anymore which was a huge bummer"
3221,"Same for me. I wear it 23 hours a day. I charge it while I shower, dress, and eat breakfast. It usually has about 35% charge when I wake up and drop it on the charger."
3222,"u/mrwcs  I just wanted you to know that I‚Äôll occasionally come back to this comment you made and and smile. I know it seems small, but it was a great message. Hope you‚Äôre keeping well"
3223,"I‚Äôm on the most up to date software available at this point.
I‚Äôd likely be more on the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre using it a lot‚Äù side of things, but to me, my usage isn‚Äôt too unusual."
3224,Thanks!
3225,"I would want it to be at a full refresh rate while issuing, I would want to decrease the refresh rate of the always ok feature to preserve battery life."
3226,"You are totally right. My friend uses his watch more than a simple watch. Notifications, reading email, workout tracking during daily comute so the 3-4 days he gets are impressive. I get 2 days from my Gear S3 so S4 battery life is way better."
3227,"Same, my battery performs very poor. S4 would be also a good choice since almost identical as S5 and it‚Äôs cheaper"
3228,"That‚Äôs what my biggest gripe was, I loved my S2 but it gradually became slower. This happens over time so it‚Äôs not as noticeable but every now and then it would just bog down and I would just become frustrated."
3229,Serious question: what's the point of the titanium version if it's the easiest to scratch? Pictures online make it look almost identical in appearance to the aluminum cases.
3230,"I have the standard Titanium model and no scratches at all, that being said I‚Äôm also a cautious person but have bumped it a few times and dreaded looking at it because of everything I‚Äôve heard. No scratches still.

It‚Äôs funny, people say that the standard Titanium model is the easiest to scratch yet my S2SS has micro abrasions out the wazoo even after a few days of ownership. My Titanium still looks like it just came out of the box."
3231,"On my S2 there was always a notable loading time before I could do anything, like opening/using apps and using Siri. On the S5 everything happens almost instantly, so I actually started doing a lot of smaller things, like setting reminders, on my watch instead of picking up my phone. My S2 was mostly used for Activity Tracking and telling the time."
3232,"The improved response time is my biggest praise over the S2. Nothing is hung up on the loading circle or Siri taking twenty years to figure out my dictation. The new display is also a plus but as far as a functional watch that‚Äôs not too big a deal. I was just mainly becoming frustrated with how slow my S2 was becoming. 

I probably would have held out longer but I received a raise and a promotion at work and the fianc√© told me to treat myself."
3233,"Love the color and it's nearly impossible to scratch, plus it has the sapphire screen."
3234,"I had very specific criteria for it being ""worth it."" Just because because I can afford doesn't mean I'm automatically going to buy it."
3235,Yeah it does and I use it at night too but if your sleeve covers the watch it should turn it off anyway. No reason to switch theater mode on and off because it wastes battery in your sleeve
3236,I do this at night. But an automatic complete darkness shift would be an awesome feature.
3237,What kind of battery life do you get?
3238,"9to5Mac said the S5 is largely unchanged and has the same exact processor.

3239,"Silicon*

Silicone is for lube, toys and implants."
3240,"The AOD is such a big fuck you to S4 and even S3 owners.  The devices are totally capable of it, it‚Äôs a software thing, and they just choose to keep a feature back my 5 year old Android watch had."
3241,"I will say this to your first point, after the most recent update to my phone‚Äôs OS (13.1.2), it seems like my watch battery life improved substantially. I wear from 7:00 AM to about 11:00 PM most days. Before the update, my watch would give me the low battery warning between 7:00 and 9:30 PM. After the update I‚Äôve not seen it once."
3242,Yeah it seems like the S5 is probably what they were shooting for when they started designing the S4 but then had to pull back on features due to time and cost constraints. I‚Äôm personally hoping the S6 is a nice leap from the S4/5 but given the lack of competition in the smart watch space not sure we will see much improvement.
3243,"Yeah, I definitely considered that.  As a long time Apple customer, I have done similar things for Macs.  Just wait till the new MacBook Pro is announced and go buy previous model when prices are dropped. I know my sleep schedule is horrible, I don't need my watch to tell me."
3244,Same
3245,I got about 14 hours on my S5 and I'm currently at 50% with AOD all day as well.  I also worked out today for 25 mins on a treadmill.  S5 Rocks!!!
3246,"I‚Äôve been wearing mine for 12 hours and I‚Äôm at 70%. I work from home so it spent less than 15 minutes on the charger when I showered at 11am, but otherwise it‚Äôs been in use."
3247,Same x3
3248,Mines normally about 20% but it‚Äôs been slowly getting better
3249,Um ‚Ä¶ happy to hear it! I‚Äôm doing fine. Not active in this sub anymore but I still like apple watches. This sub used to be (and possibly still is) very repetitive and I eventually got tired enough of it that I stopped browsing it. Guess I was already getting tired if it when I made the original comment lol.
3250,Maybe go through the usual reset or unpair and re-pair?
3251,It already does this? Maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding what you‚Äôre asking.
3252,"If you can find one, apple had discontinued it so won‚Äôt be around for long. 

I‚Äôve wanted AOD since day one, so it‚Äôs 5 or nothing for me. If it‚Äôs not for you then the 4 makes total sense"
3253,"The promo material really doesn‚Äôt show off just how nice the stainless steel & titanium finishes are. The light clumps on the titanium in a unique way that gives it a very different look in person, also it doesn‚Äôt look as brushed as it looks in ads."
3254,"I have the regular Ti one, so far so good. I don‚Äôt agree on the appearance, the Ti has a much different shine to it, the brushed finish is visible and it isn‚Äôt so white/silver like the Al models."
3255,"This echoes my change in behaviour too, once I upgraded I found myself using my watch more because it's more efficient."
3256,I second this too. The ceramic color stands out over all AW colors and it  is extremely gorgeous. I love the ceramic strength material which makes it the most scratch resistance.
3257,I didn't say otherwise. I just think your criteria aren't necessarily aligned with what most people consider when deciding whether to upgrade.
3258,[deleted]
3259,"My battery life is abysmal as others have reported. I've got an open case with Apple support about it. I've also seen threads where beta testers for WatchOS 6.1 say that battery life is improved, so I'm holding out for that."
3260,This is making me hold off for the 6.
3261,"This is not true. While the display uses the same tech, the controller hardware for efficiency/low power states necessary for always on display are not present in pre-Series 5 models."
3262,"Did you watch the video? 2 minutes into the video MKBHD states that the always on display is a hardware feature, not software."
3263,They‚Äôre not though. The Series 5 has a different screen controller in hardware that adjusts the refresh rate of the screen so you can have always on. The S4 doesn‚Äôt have this chip. There is also a U1 chip in the S5 that the S4 doesn‚Äôt have. So no they couldn‚Äôt offer this feature in software without depleting the battery in just a couple of hours.
3264,The older devices don't have the controller which reduces the display refresh rate while AOD is active. Sure the older watches could do it but not without a massive hit to the battery life.
3265,"> The devices are totally capable of it, it‚Äôs a software thing, and they just choose to keep a feature back

This is apple. You know what you signed up for."
3266,"That‚Äôs good news. If they can optimize it to the point where it lasts just as long or longer than the S4 with AOD, I might get a second watch."
3267,Same x2
3268,"I use theater mode while I sleep, so it uses less power overnight than it does when I‚Äôm awake. Maybe that‚Äôs the difference."
3269,"Sheesh that last post did NOT get proof read. Sorry. I mean when not in use but has the ‚Äúalways on‚Äù display on, I would hope to be able to decrease the refresh rate to 0.2Hz or lower (not even sure if that‚Äôs a thing), instead of the 1Hz discussed in the video in order to save battery."
3270,How about scratches?
3271,"Again, my criteria was very specific, which I detailed in my first post. Obviously worth is going to be different depending on who you talk to, regardless of whether someone can afford something or not.

Your post implied I willingly throw my money around even without putting more thought in than someone else, which isn't true."
3272,"Thanks for the explanation! I thought it was an ambient light sensor that could sense when there‚Äôs 0 light in a room, thanks for the examination!"
3273,"Trust me, if my watch from 5 years ago could do it, theirs can as well.  Either they‚Äôre greedy or inept in not adding it from the start.  Either way, it‚Äôs not good."
3274,It‚Äôs something they didn‚Äôt need the hardware for.  It‚Äôs just another way for apple to pretend they invented the wheel.
3275,U1? I don't recall seeing that mentioned for the watch - got a source on that?
3276,My Huawei Watch and LG could with a day of battery life easily.
3277,"True.  They never cease to let you down with outdated features blocked by software. 

I mainly switched to Apple because I feel like I have more control over it than with Google."
3278,Same x3
3279,"I do too, i don‚Äôt need to check the time in the middle of the night and if I do I‚Äôll tap it. However my watch used to die at night even at 30% when I slept so it‚Äôs getting better"
3280,Can you program theater mode for a time like DND?
3281,"That I don‚Äôt know. I would assume there‚Äôs a limit to minimum amount of times a panel can refresh in a second. I think the minimum is 1hz.

Edit: I think I see what you may be saying without putting it into correct terms. Maybe 1 refresh every 2 seconds. So it skips a second. Makes sense now."
3282,It‚Äôs like new still. No micro abrasions or anything. I‚Äôve had it since Monday.
3283,"The post you replied to was simply saying going from s4 to s5 is not a huge upgrade, and even s3 to s4. You said the upgrade was worth it to you, implying either that you claim the upgrade to be significant for most users, in which case I disagree; Or that the upgrade is significant for *some* users, in which case... Duh? Of course it will always be a significant upgrade for some people"
3284,What did they say?
3285,"""Can do it"" doesn't mean they can flip a switch and have it on.

There's nothing in the the design that allows them to enable AOD with the original OLED display. Burn-in was not something they wanted to risk given how expensive some of the watches and materials were.

The *only* option, as far as Apple is concerned, is to utilize the LTPO technology to enable AOD. No LTPO, no AOD. Simple. It's not a ""fuck you,"" you didn't *have* to upgrade to the S4 or even S3, and there will *always* be something better in a year."
3286,"And my cell phone from 20 years ago had 30 days of battery life. Not really an apples-to-apples comparison, though."
3287,"Damn you seem to know literally everything about the series 3, 4, and 5 Apple Watch"
3288,"Are you serious?  Do you know how this actually works?  Don't answer that, you don't."
3289,"Grats? They're not the same display hardware, silicone, OS, the etc. The point of your comment was why this wasn't enabled on older AW generations."
3290,"Heh, I felt the opposite in that there are less controls (and a lot less things I can troubleshoot with when there are problems). But it just work so darn well out of the box. But yeah, figure after 9 years on Android time to give apple a look."
3291,Nope. I just turn it on on my way to bed. I have the DND button for my phone next to the theater mode button in Watch‚Äôs control center and it‚Äôs just a routine for me now to tap both when I get in bed.
3292,"Yeah, sorry not very eloquent on it‚Äîvery much a layman on the topic. The usefulness of an always on display that refreshes once every 30 seconds is, for all intents and purposes, the same as one that refreshes once a second. I need it to be always on to glance at the time or one of my complications, not to see up to the second information‚Äîwhen I need that, I‚Äôll always be bringing my watch up in front of me and interacting with it bring it up to ‚Äúfull speed.‚Äù"

""Worth it to me"" never implies anything except worth to me, not even sure how you'd come to the conclusion I'd be implying worth for anyone else.

In fact, the person I replied to *was* implying worth for other people, which you fundamentally cannot do.

The entire point of my post was that [worth is subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value), I was just detailing my requirements."
3294,They said it was based on touch not a sensor so it couldn‚Äôt do that because the sleeve wouldn‚Äôt be triggering the touch sensors
3295,"Fact based, even toned response. There is hope for the Internet yet."
3296,"It‚Äôs more than just LTPO, though. The Series 4 DOES have LTPO, which is what this person is presumably referring to. But it‚Äôs more than just LTPO that enables the AOD."

3299,"There are less controls over what?  With Android you‚Äôre forced to use Google services.  There was some independent reporting showing just how much data they collect and it‚Äôs astonishing.

3303,"I never thought I‚Äôd say this, but he‚Äôs giving anti-feminists a bad name"
3304,Ok then explain the differences in battery life between WearOS and Tizen?
3305,"Yes, the silicone. The chips that are used in the devices. The hardware that deals with the actual computing of the watch and the various functions of the display."
3306,"Less control over customization of my devices. You want daily weather instead of hourly on a watch face widget? Too bad. There are less diagnostic data when things break. My Apple Watch was draining all the battery from 100% in 3 hours and there is no built in tool to tell me which app was draining it, the solution was to ""just reset it"".

>and doesn‚Äôt work with governments to design products to censor entire countries like China.

Is Apple any less guilty when it comes to China vs. Google?

But yes, additional app permissions are real nice."
3307,Aaaaaand we‚Äôre back. ;-)
3308,Find me a watch with the same specs that runs both.
3309,"Yeah, if half decade old silicone can do it, I think year old silicone can just fine."
3310,"Almost like software features have to be designed for separately. 
 
Huh."
3311,As with some apple products I can't wait for the next generations. It'll be very much refined the more they get with it. 
3312,"... all of these things can be said of almost every other smartwatch out there. I'm quietly a little disappointed as well, but I haven't used the thing yet. I'm still preordering one.  I like the unique features it has and am interested to see what jailbreaking can do for it."
3313,"I am happy to read the reviews, especially the Bloomberg one. IMO..Apple Watch is not yet ready for primetime with plenty of cons: <1 day charge, no functionality without using both hands, no always on time display, annoying taptic feedback and worst of all the obnoxious pricing and variety of models/wrist bands!

I was thinking about getting it for my birthday, but will wait until at least next year's iteration or other smartwatch providers."
3314,"Give it a year or 2. I think the price may go down a bit. Or maybe phase out the sport one and leave the regular one and the edition. Bands are also grossly expensive. But the original iPhone was like $500 on contact right? I thought buying a first gen Apple product has always been more of a gamble than anything else they made? 

Everything else is stuff I feel Apple is smart enough to iron out in the future. Once they do, I think they have the lost attractive watch on the market. Not necessarily physically attractive (though it is nice) but I mean with the 2 extra ways of interacting with the device. The digital crown and force touch tech could be pretty big, and it's probably the thing I'm most excited to see in the next iPhone (or the 7, who knows). "
3315,"The problem is it doesn't actually have a real purpose unless your someone who needs to know your heartbeat at every moment, which quite frankly would do nothing but make me paranoid."
3316,I think this watch tries to do too much and ends up not doing anything really well. This used to be the difference between Apple and other companies. Looks like Apple DOES need Steve Jobs to curate new products. Especially to say NO!
3317,Yep. This first release is an expensive public beta basically. I look forward to the 3rd or 4th iteration when everything is worked out. 
3318,"Agreed...no point buying it at this point, especially with so many flaws in it at this point. "
3319,"I read you can activate Siri just using her hot word, ""Hey Siri"". So that's something, although the she's super limited on the watch too. "
3320,Gotta use both hands?!
3321,They get to charge $350 for something that should cost $100. Why? Because fuck you they're Apple that's why lmao 
3322,This guy's on point 
3323,Yes!! Specifically to browse various apps on it. 
3324,"Well the watch is already on one arm, how else would you control it without using the other hand?"
3325,No...?
3326,"Is that what is implied, or do they mean you gotta take it off your wrist?"
3327,I don't understand why you seem offended. Read the Verge article by Nilay Patel and he clearly mentions that you have to use both hands to make sure you are hitting right parts of its tiny screen.
3328,"I personally don't think /u/pchampn knows what he's talking about.  The display isn't always on but will turn on if you raise it to look at it.  It's a watch you have it on one wrist and use your other hand to control it, I haven't seen a single review video where they use two hands to control it.  Also, how is the taptic feedback annoying? How else would you want it to notify you?  Also I'm not really sure how the pricing is obnoxious unless s/he can't afford it.  

/u/zSprawl watch the review of the Apple Watch from The Verge, its a pretty brutal and honest review imo.
http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"
3329,I'm beginning to think you're somehow mentally handicapped. How do you expect to use something that is strapped to your wrist without it occupying both hands? 
3330,Will do. Thanks. 
3331,"The Verge article you reference proves my point, so it seems you didn't read it.

Regarding taptic feedback...READ the Bloomberg article and the author makes it a clear that the taptic feedback is quite subtle, but at the same time very distracting..especially if you are in a middle of conversation and watch vibrates demanding your attention. I wouldn't want that! 

The pricing is obnoxious...no doubt about that. The only version which I find stylish is the steel version with either leather or metal straps and from the pricing it will cost at least $650 to $750, which is a high price point. 

So /u/blanksmoke read the articles and have an idea of what you are talking about before you respond to others' critique. "
3332,I'm equally confused on why he keeps posting the part of the article that I pulled.
3333,"Haha...as I said before..read the Verge article, I copy the text here for you Einstein!

It's a god damn watch with a screen, how else would you use it. 


Also you can turn off the vibrations. Stop spreading misinformation. 

The pricing isn't ""obnoxious,"" you just can't afford it.

"
3335,I am posting it bcos you don't get the point. This watch is complicated enough that you will have to remove it from your wrist and use both hands to use all of its features. 
3336,"I was right. You are retarded. But just in case you're serious...

He means that your left hand is occupied because the watch is strapped to your wrist. You know how you can text with one hand and drink coffee with the other? You can't do that with a smart watch because your left wrist is holding the watch while your right hand uses it. 

He doesn't mean that you have to take it off your wrist, dipshit. "
3337,"Here is a text from The Verge article. Read it:

Patel says the Watch, unlike the iPhone, requires two hands to use. ""You simply can‚Äôt one-hand the Apple Watch‚Ä¶because it‚Äôs a tiny screen with a tiny control wheel strapped to your wrist, you have to use both hands to use it, and you have to actually look at it to make sure you‚Äôre hitting the right parts of the screen. 

Have an iPhone plus fully paid upfront...and like to make smart purchase and not get suckered into it unfinished/buggy products. At the same time, thanks to all those suckers, Apple hopefully will have a refined product next year :)"
3338,"LOL fuck. I'm done.

/u/zSprawl"
3339,Now I know what a hood rat Apple junkie sounds like!
3340,"So explain to me what smart watch you can operate with one hand.  


Congrats on the iPhone 6 Plus paid up front, we could have an iDevice pissing contest if you want.

Also of course the first generation of every device has its kinks, the iPad, the Macbook Air, shoot even the 12 inch rMBP."

3346,"Nice review.

I went from an S0 to an S4 last year, and I really like the always on display part, but it‚Äôs not quite enough for me to upgrade.

Here‚Äôs hoping my S4 stays alive as long as my S0 did."

3349,"""I haven't found the standby faces to be impoverished in any way"". Jesus Christ."
3350,Hodinkee has a certain target demographic!  For that demo the Edition Apple Watch is just a fun thing to pick up and try out.
3351,I'd be more interested in a review showing how it survives bumping into things all day.
3352,Wish he would‚Äôve shown it with some other bands like the Link Bracelet.
3353,"I REALLY want to get the Titanium S5, but Idk if it's worth it over my Aluminum S4... :-( $800 is a lot to swallow for a watch that will be outdated in a year."
3354,[removed]
3355,It's a damn shame we don't have access to any other models bar the Aluminium here in Ireland. I really wanted to get one of those smooth Titanium models.
3356,Went from a series 0 to a Series 4 last year ; the fact that an upgrade even crossed my mind is due to that always on feature. Then I think imagine what a series 8 will do. And I‚Äôm happy to wait. The S4 really performs the tasks I need swiftly.  Anyone getting a S5 is gonna be pretty happy. I‚Äôm stoked for you.
3357,Can someone explain to me why the titanium version is so much more when they are giving away titanium credit cards to people with approved credit? Seems like there is more titanium in the card than the watch...
3358,The titanium silver finish looks so nice.
3359,So excited for my titanium one to come in on Friday.
3360,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Apple‚Äôs board room, the senior executive team, the shareholders AND Jony Ive personally, for making the Watch 5 become a reality.

Their incessant drive for technological improvement and their keen finger on the pulse of what the market needs makes this product -the- best wearable of any brand or type of 2019.

Thanks again, Apple!"
3361,"I've pre-ordered the S5, but mostly because I buy the new model each year and give my old one to a friend/family member.  Last year the upgrade to the S4 was the biggest Apple Watch upgrade, but this year was rather disappointing.  Sure, the always on will be nice, and for a few of us, the compass and international emergency calling is nice, but it's disappointing that it can't roam.

It's also disappointing that outside of the always-on display, international emergency calling, and compass, there's nothing else except for 2 cases should you choose them, but if not, that's it.  And about those cases... You're paying a premium price for them, but they have no matching premium bands.  The black Stainless Steel looks and feels awesome with the black Milanese  as does the silver Stainless Steel and the Rose Gold.  But if you had those and the aluminum Apple Watches along with the titanium, which do you think most people would guess would be the most expensive?  

The reviewer talks about the weight difference, but didn't Apple update the website because the weight difference is insignificant?

I know it sounds like I'm complaining too much, but really I understand that there's only so much Apple can upgrade these on a yearly basis and sometimes we have to settle for these types of upgrades, but this review is really overplaying how significant of an upgrade this is.  He was right the first time, this is really a 4.5 (or 4s if you will), and sometimes, that's ok."
3362,On an S0 right now and debating whether to update or if I can still go another year
3363,iJustine ordered one but hasn't come in yet.
3364,I'm getting mine tomorrow. Unfortunately though it looks like Apple cheaped out this year and didn't include a charging pad like they did with the Series 3 Edition models.
3365,It comes with the natural Titanium model along with whatever band you want.
3366,Thank you I've been trying to figure out what band this is forever. I wanted to get this band paired with the black aluminum but I guess it's only exclusive to the titanium version?
3367,Never saw that in the bible.
3368,"poor choice of words, but in his (weak) defense, a watch edition apple watch costs only a fraction of what is normally on his wrist"
3369,what does this sentence even mean?
3370,"Anyone that wears a watch for even a short while knows to avoid bumping it into hard objects. With that being said, if that‚Äôs a concern for you, the black stainless AW is the most resilient watch to scratches and scuffs."
3371,"The modern buckle, link bracelet, and Milanese loop are only available as SS and no Ti variant exists from Apple."
3372,If it makes you feel any better I‚Äôm currently still absolutely in love with my Edition S3 watch and don‚Äôt look to upgrade anytime soon.
3373,"Even if you upgrade watch every year, it is so much easier to sell last year's aluminum model for say 250-280 with no hassle. Don't know how pricier watch models hold their resale value as there will be less demand for them in used market."
3374,I kept my SS S2 for 3 years and am thinking of doing the same for Titanium S5. It also comes with 2 bands and 2 years of ~~Apple Care~~ limited warranty by default vs 1 yr for aluminum - so deduct those from the sticker price and it becomes a little more bearable
3375,By that logic won't all watches be outdated in a year? I mean I know someone with a S0 that's still working fine enough.
3376,"No, same as Series 4. Only differences are (compared to S4)

- always on screen
- compass
- Internal storage increased to 32GB from 16GB"
3377,Bigger than what?
3378,Here too in the Netherlands. We don‚Äôt have any of the cellular models.
3379,"Well, there‚Äôs the sapphire screen instead of Ion-X Glass. But, of course, it‚Äôs also a pricing strategy."
3380,"I upgraded from S4->S5 but I am ok with these small improvements as S3->S4 is pretty big update. Expecting less bezels, sleep analysis among other things in next refresh."
3381,"I‚Äôm also on a S0 and I honestly think this is the year.  Last year was the full redesign, and this year is a refinement of that with the always-on display.  I just have to scratch together the money because I really don‚Äôt want to step down from the SS to the aluminum when all my bands have the SS lugs."
3382,"Imo, stop torturing yourself. I went from a first gen to series 4 and have not looked back. Th prfrmamce, battery life, display, it‚Äôs all exponentially better than what they came out with originally. If I didn‚Äôt get the series 4 already, I‚Äôd definitely pick up this years.

Plus, the fact that the first gen hasn‚Äôt seen a security update in over a year now is enough of a reason to stop using it."

3385,Jesus only wore ceramic watches.
3386,It‚Äôs in Wearablians 3:14.
3387,It means that the dimming of the faces whilst they‚Äôre idle in the always on mode doesn‚Äôt make them look bad
3388,Surely the white ceramic is the most resistant case material?
3389,"Thanks. It doesn't. Lol

But I'm glad you're happy with your S3. I'm sure if I had gotten the Stainless S4 I'd be less inclined to be contemplating the S5 jump. But the Always on screen, better battery life, AND the titanium casing is such a tantalizing lure for me."
3390,Tom sometimes I see you on this sub and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhello there lost boy‚Äù
3391,The S3 didn‚Äôt have an Edition did it?
3392,"Yea, I‚Äôm sure the premium material ones have shit resale value in comparison. That‚Äôs another thing that makes it hard to justify the upgrade"
3393,"SS models have a horrible resale value. Not sure about Titanium and Ceramic. But, I doubt it's going to be ""good""."
3394,"Really?! I didn‚Äôt know that, that‚Äôs awesome!"
3395,"The OG Applewatch has been showing it's age for the last 3 years, go ask my EX. She hated it right around when the S2 was released. I like my S4, but I regretted not getting the Stainless Steel model as mine has a ton of screen scratches. I'd love to get the S5 in Titanium as it would be even lighter and more durable than the stainless. I just can't justify that price. Even with selling off my S4... I guess I'll wait for S6 and hope it's cheaper/I'm in a better financial state to justify the expense."
3396,Don‚Äôt have the cellular also. Darn shame really.
3397,"I‚Äôm at the point to where I‚Äôm not sure if I want a $430 watch, or if I could do with the $199 S3. But If I upgrade then I want the features so I feel like waiting one year may save me some cash, and I plan on keeping my next watch for another 5 years hopefully since this old one lasted that easily. 

I‚Äôm between replacing my S0 watch or my 2011 MacBook Pro. 

$430 on a watch or $1900 on a laptop"
3398,">	Plus, the fact that the first gen hasn‚Äôt seen a security update in over a year now is enough of a reason to stop using it.

Does this matter if everything that gets to the watch must run through the phone first anyway? My apologies if this question is really dumb and I just don‚Äôt realize it."
3399,"For me the watch still works great, but then again I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm missing out on on new watches. 

I can check the weather and notifications, it still last me 1.5 days if wearing and using it. I‚Äôll have to see what new features were added"
3400,Yes. Ceramic gets a white band with a ceramic pin. Space Black Titanium gets a darker band. Then you get to choose any other band.
3401,Did Jesus have the Series 0 or something else?
3402,Why did OP say Jesus Christ then? üòÇ I'm confused!
3403,"Yes, if you have the money ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
3404,"Well here take this: do it. 

üòõ"
3405,That me hehe ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
3406,Sure did.
3407,Sorry not Apple Care but 2 years of limited warranty vs 1 yr of the normal watch
3408,"Why not both?

&#x200B;

for everything else theres mastercard /s"
3409,"If you‚Äôre gonna get a not-brand-new Apple Watch replacement, get the S4 at least."
3410,Or a 299 s4
3411,"Your watch also connects directly via Wi-Fi. There have been security issues when it comes to just opening text messages. What are the odds of someone hacking your old Apple Watch? I‚Äôd say low... but personally I can hardly trust something that‚Äôs even 100% up to date to be secure. With all of the different businesses and governments trying desperately to absorb every single bit of information about us... even just being a little bit possible still means it‚Äôs possible. 

Who knows what the next big security F-up will be? Maybe it will be a flaw with older revisions of ApplePay stuff and the next time you use your Watch to buy something at your local whatever, maybe that will be a breach in some way. Meanwhile Apple comes out with an update that patches that flaw in watchOS 6.1.4. I know I‚Äôm speculating, but crazier things have happened and there no reason to think that we‚Äôre immune to it."
3412,"Have you received a replacement or paid for a new battery since your initial purchase? Because I‚Äôm impressed it lasts you that long on a charge. I got to a point where it would want to go in low power mode before the end of my day. Also with very lite use too because it always felt too slow to do anything other than telling time, date, and weather compared to pulling out my phone. Now I still don‚Äôt use it heavily but I do use at least double the features I did before. Siri is much more responsive even though I still keep Hey Siri off. I now use a sleep tracking app and I don‚Äôt have to recharge very often for that to work. The new faces and complications are very nice to have. The screen is definitely better. Raise to wake is significantly faster. That last one is especially important to me because after using an Apple Watch, then switching to a regular automatic watch while on vacation, then going back to the Apple Watch... OMG that delay was insane. Even thought the amount of time is practically nothing, once you use something that‚Äôs ‚Äúalways on‚Äù that little bit of a difference is very noticeable. I‚Äôd compare it to being like the difference between your computer with an HDD verses the first one you got with an SSD. 

I wound up setting that first gen Apple Watch aside and just switched back to the old automatic watch I inherited from the 70s. I missed the notifications though, so when the Series 4 was announce I pre ordered the 44mm aluminum one. I figure these things still aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdone‚Äù yet. Once these things are like ten years old, then I‚Äôll consider snagging a stainless steel or Edition version. Even then, I‚Äôm hesitant to spend that kind of cash on something that will be outdated. Idk, but could you imaging being one of the people who bought the real gold edition? I‚Äôm sure they have the cash to burn and just buy whatever they want whenever they want... but still I‚Äôm definitely not in that kind of position of luxury lol!"
3413,"So it's basically the same price as the Stainless Steel version, and you just have to buy an extra band for it?"
3414,"Because that word doesnt fit in that context.  It's almost like the author wrote the script and then changed the original word to a longer, fancier sounding synonym without understanding why that changes the meaning."
3415,"Or you could buy the aluminum one, dent it, buy another one, and still have money leftover."
3416,Just looked it up and you‚Äôre right. So weird. I swore the series 2 was the last one to have one. Guess the 3 was.
3417,You mean Apple Card?
3418,I think it‚Äôs only $50 cheaper than a S5
3419,Where?
3420,"Nope still original battery. Like I woke up at 7am today and put it in. Right now at  10:55pm it is still at 58% battery. 

Yea I will say I can‚Äôt really use Siri on my watch but I use it on my phone easily. 

Yea the always in display is something I am excited to see in person. That would be a big feature for mea even though it‚Äôs nothing crazy big

I agree, the cost doesn‚Äôt make sense for me the more I look at it. I try to keep my thing for a long time so I‚Äôm not sure if I should get it now or wait. I want to keep my electronics Kong‚Äôs to make it cheaper to own over time. 

My $1200 iPhone X I want to keep at least 4 years before upgrading. That‚Äôs a year longer than my last 2 phones which cost a lot less. $300/year

My MacBook cost $1600 in 2011 and I still have it and now it is kind of slowing down but still running great. That last me 8 years and I think another year or so easily. $200/year

Then a $500 watch that I keep 5 year or more hopefully. I assume I could since this S0 I kept since launch. $100/year 

I can‚Äôt imagine being one of those original people with a solid gold watch! It would be great if Apple only sold a limited amount if they could swap out the internals for them for a few ever year or something."
3421,"It‚Äôs actually $100 more than Stainless. And no, it just comes with two bands. You choose the second one and one is predetermined."
3422,"There's a whole jargon around luxury goods that sounds ridiculous if you're not a member of the club. ""Bespoke"" rather than ""custom"", etc. ""Impoverished"" is a particularly telling substitution for ""degraded""."
3423,I‚Äôd argue it kinda works for the ‚Äòdrained of vitality/strength‚Äô definition of impoverished
3424,"Except it‚Äôs a perfectly acceptable synonym. It means ‚Äòdeprived of strength or vitality‚Äô which is clearly the intent when talking about the low-power versions of the face.

I‚Äôm guessing that OP is affronted by use of language that _also_ relates to _people_ being poor in the context of a luxury watch review."
3425,"This, plus using the word ""impoverished"" had a classist (maybe that's not the right word. Maybe tone deaf to the general population). tone to me that seemed douchey. (I own a Series 4, that I love, so I am not saying that owning an Apple Watch is douchey.)"
3426,Haha I was gonna say I can send pictures of my box if you really want
3427,"Oh...wow, that sucks.

I don‚Äôt know then...I‚Äôd get the newer one personally, but I get the much lower price is nice."
3428,Looks like [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-4-GPS-44mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case/485327148?selected=true&irgwc=1&sourceid=imp_VKx2W8VJ6xyJTJUwUx0Mo382Ukn0rLXlR12CWY0&veh=aff&wmlspartner=imp_221109&clickid=VKx2W8VJ6xyJTJUwUx0Mo382Ukn0rLXlR12CWY0) has it a little cheaper.
3429,Walmart most recently
3430,"Oh, right. I just meant that if you factor in the cost of that second band ($50) the price difference between the two is $50 less because the Stainless only comes with one band."
3431,"TBF, at least in the world of tailoring and shoes, there is an actual difference between ""bespoke"" and ""custom"". Bespoke means that the item was crafted from a pattern that was drafted from scratch to fit only the singular client. Custom just means that the client had some undefined level of control over some aspect of the customization."
3432,Bespoke vs custom is a British/American divide. You get bespoke software in British development.
3433,">classist (maybe that's not the right word

Thesaurist"
3434,"Yea my thoughts too 

I‚Äôm leaning towards it, but I am going to have a shoulder procedure soon so I may get a laptop so I don‚Äôt carry 6+ pounds around anymore 

Amazon has a great deal right now on a new MacBook Pro"
3435,"Wait, isn‚Äôt that $10 more than a brand new S5?"
3436,Also you get 2 years AppleCare standard with the Edition models too.
3437,"True, but plenty of purely American companies use ""bespoke"" out of pretensiousness."
3438,I‚Äôm going to guess this started with fashion and American (and other) makers decided it imbued a bit more class and decided to adopt it as a marketing tactic.
3439,So it would make more sense to purchase the titanium instead of steel one. I actually just about to purchase the steel one coz it‚Äôs cheaper. Thanks for the information.
3440,Is there a link for this? I‚Äôm interested if true but can‚Äôt find anything related to it.
3441,Yup - one of the reasons I'm really considering the titanium
3442,"https://www.apple.com/ca/support/products/watch/

Under Apple Watch Edition/Hermes it shows it comes with 2 years, and if you buy AppleCare, it'll extend to 3 years."
3443,"Ahh nice, thank you. 

Where does the 2 straps reference come from? Can‚Äôt see that anywhere on the edition info site or purchase pages."

3445,"> But Little Else to Warrant Upgrading

I'm always surprised to see how often reviews talk about wether it's worth upgrading _from last year's model_.

Seems like a pattern for all Apple product reviews. Meanwhile, IRL, I see very few people considering yearly upgrades. Existing Apple Watch users I see considering upgrading to the S5 are currently using older models, not the S4.

Not sure if reviewers are out of touch with their target audience, or if my anecdotal observations aren't representative of their target audience."
3446,[deleted]
3447,"See, personally, I think the 32Gb of storage space is a much bigger factor for upgrading to a S5 than an S4. Yet I see no reviews make a big deal out of it.

Going from an S2 to a S5 just for apps and music will be dramatic. The AOD is sort of just a bonus for me."
3448,[deleted]
3449,"I went from a Series 0 to a Series 3. My god was that an upgrade! I didn't realize until then just how slow the Series 0 was. When Series 4 came out I upgraded again, but simply because I was able to sell my Series 3 a couple of weeks before the keynote, so it only cost me like $50.

I don't feel the need to upgrade again."
3450,"Kinda wish Apple had a similar program to iUP for Apple Watch. I know I can trade my S4 in and use that money toward a new S5, but I wish I could just do an even trade and pay monthly."
3451,People don‚Äôt upgrade their watches like phones though. The wear on them is very little if you‚Äôre careful and most people who upgrade tend to skip 2-3 years before doing so.
3452,Is this watch face available on all models or only Hermes?
3453,The last Apple Watch I had was the Series 1. Are there any features that are worth checking out as someone who isn‚Äôt much of a fitness person?
3454,The biggest complaint is the battery life.  A watch that can last a week without charge would be amazing.
3455,"I'd be coming from a S2, which still works perfectly. I'm perfectly content with it not gonna lie, but the dark side is tempting me to upgrade friday lol"
3456,I'm thinking a Series 0 and iPhone 6 upgrade to series 5 and pro max might be on the cards this year... i've got 5 years of tech to catch up with now!
3457,"I am still on a Series 2, which I love - but my biggest complaint is how sluggish the UI is... especially launching workouts. I am considering an upgrade just for the speed difference."
3458,"Coming from a stainless steel series 0 and looking forward to this. The always on display has been my hold out. However. My work involves giving things over 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Tapping the screen to keep the device awake to assure a steady motion is important for me. If this ends up not facilitating a second hand that stays on (at least longer on raise or tap), I have no problem returning waiting another gen or 2."
3459,"First time iWatch buyer (s5 sg Alu 44mm midnight blue sb strap) ...

Normally go Zagg Skins for new products, but I think $35 for a all protective case is absurd. I just can't afford that much after getting said watch right now. I want protection from day one, so.. What is a more affordable option for complete protection for my new investment?"
3460,">	There‚Äôs a compass now, and while it‚Äôs fun to play with, I don‚Äôt recall ever needing a compass in my entire life.	

Does Gruber not use any mapping application? Even if he doesn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that hard to imagine its use cases. If you are using Maps in a walking situation having the map quickly orientating you to the proper direction is invaluable.

The iPhone has had this for so long (iPhone 3GS) that I think people forgot how useful it is and that the Apple Watch is just catching up (albeit understandable given its small size) in having a set of basic sensor suites of GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer (compass)."
3461,"I've never owned a apple watch and in all honesty will be wearing it casually at weekends (job wont allow me to wear a watch)

I'm really tempted by the Watch 3 at ¬£200. Whilst it's missing some features from the 4 and 5 series the price point is great. How does the watch hold up? is it still decent or is it better to go all in and get a series 5?"
3462,"*but little else to warrant upgrading from Series 4.

It annoys me a little bit when reviewers write as if a lot of people are upgrading year to year on these device reviews."
3463,That‚Äôs why I gave my series 3 to my wife (it replaced her series 1) and replaced it with a Misfit. If I can‚Äôt see what time it is then the watch is useless to me.
3464,"Considering my S3 is lost in the abyss (wish I could find it) I need to upgrade, I was going to get an S4 but the prices are the exact same, might as well get an S5."
3465,"I‚Äôm waiting to read reviews from a fitness perspective. I‚Äôm a long distance runner and what I need is a watch that will play locally stored music and podcasts, track gps, and monitor heart rate for upwards of 4 hours ‚Äî preferably with the screen on. If the series 5 can, then it is an easy buy."
3466,"I think I‚Äôm the only person that isn‚Äôt a fan of the always on. I like the look of the watch when it‚Äôs off, and an always on display- even at its lowest setting is going to look bright in a dark room. 

Is there a way to turn the feature off?"
3467,Upgrade to Series 5 or stick with Series 3?
3468,Literally only a compass and always on display. Not worth a upgrade from the 4 imo.
3469,Coming from S1. Love this watch but man does Siri not work at all. Apps take minutes to load. The timer and notifications work remarkably but in happy to upgrade.
3470,"Coming from never owned one, I'm there.  Now to decide which version..."
3471,"I'd love a ceramic case, but for a device with a limited lifespan that's functionally identical to one a third of the price, they're out of their damn minds with what they're charging for them. Even if I had the money, it's not in any way reasonable. Not as bad as those Edition launch models, but still way too much."
3472,"I‚Äôm still rocking the OG Apple Watch, and to be honest, I still have no interest in upgrading. It does what I need it to do. Good enough."
3473,You can turn off the always-on display to get extra hours from it. I've never owned an Apple watch. I guess this year I'll buy it.
3474,"Keep your 4. If you have a series 0, 1, 2, or 3, consider the upgrade."
3475,this article is terrible. Always on display is a huge warrant to upgrading. I know tons of people with apple watchs from 1-4 who are all planning on getting it for that feature alone. And it will be my first series watch as well.
3476,"First time buyer here, I just want one."
3477,[deleted]
3478,I agree with you on that one! You got some great self discipline to not have upgraded earlier! I think the always on display is worth the upgrade from any series. I can't wait!
3479,I went from a 0 to 4. You‚Äôll love it!
3480,"I somehow shattered my series 0 screen. Ran out and got a series 2 that same day. Been holding out for a while but definitely ordering this on Friday (payday whoop!). 

I just wanted one that‚Äôs a bit faster and the always on display and EKG is intriguing. On a side note my wife wants an Apple Watch and she‚Äôs not a power user like I am, she‚Äôs super stoked to finally be getting mine! I call thay a double win!"
3481,"I, too, have an S0 (not cracked). It‚Äôll be fun to actually use apps again that aren‚Äôt just homescreen complications!"
3482,I‚Äôm on my 2nd Series 0 and it's so slow. Finally upgraded to the titanium 5. Looking forward to a speed and battery upgrade!
3483,"I was planning on upgrading for the 4, but was gifted a 3 a couple months before. I love it and appreciated the gift, but pulling the trigger on the always on screen :)"
3484,Same I had the original series 0 for so long now. It‚Äôs getting to the point where i notice how slow it is compared to my friends watches. I‚Äôm excited for the new watch
3485,"I'm still on my may 2015 Sport, I'm hoping next year is gonna be a big one. I wanted to upgrade this year, but I can't do it knowing something huge might come (and because my watch still works).

If nothing happens, then oh well, I'll just have the newest watch."
3486,"Eh.

The Series 4 was certainly a worthy upgrade even coming from the Series 3. It had significant upgrades, like the bigger display and the EKG (which is huge for a lot of people and a feat of engineering)."
3487,"It‚Äôs not just an apple product reviews thing, it‚Äôs a tech reviews thing.

To offer a counter argument, when I read something like this I wonder if I should buy last year‚Äôs version instead.

For example, I was looking at an AV receiver for my home theatre system and Onkyo has a 2019 range, and the model I was considering wasn‚Äôt a big upgrade from last year but was an additional 400 dollars. So when I read that, it signalled to me not that everyone with a 2018 receiver should think twice before throwing it out, but that someone currently in the market should consider saving the 400 bucks and just get last year‚Äôs model."
3488,"I like that the NYTimes review of the new iPhones specifically addressed this and basically said ""We need to reset our expectations about how often people actually upgrade their devices... the new iPhones are great but if you have anything newer than the 6S, you're probably fine."""
3489,"Gruber wrote something about that in the iPhone 11 review.
It's hard to find other metrics that are somewhat standard. Even harder if you're in a position where you're forced to always have the newest of everything."
3490,"imo it also feels like at times they are out of touch with the prices of these devices.  
I¬¥m sure you would see a lot less recommendation to buy if they had to pay for this stuff themselves.  
This is why I mostly focus on the parts where they test it and go into detail about specific aspects/specs and less on the ""is it wort it"" question"
3491,"Basically all of Apples products are multi-year upgrade cycles now.  I went from an iPad Retina to last years iPad Pro, and ever since the iPhone 4S it has been easy to squeeze out three years of useful life.  I am still on a 2011 iMac and likely can‚Äôt justify upgrading for another two years.  I have a series 2 watch and will likely get the S5. The S2 is just slower now, and the aluminum around the back crystal is showing corrosion as well.  I still don‚Äôt see paying up for the cellular model, and the stainless steel  would probably hold up better than aluminum but I will likely stick with another Nike version."
3492,"The people who read tech sites are the demographic that generally considers whether or not a yearly upgrade makes sense for them given the hardware updates. Yes, that isn‚Äôt everyone but it certainly applies to the readership of those sites."
3493,"Well I never really understood why someone would get an Apple Watch at all, nobody can really explain me why they need it and mostly see it as a gimmick and something they use to look at their phone less."
3494,"I agree 100 %. I am upgrading from S0 to S5. I also just recently upgraded from iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone X. That was a huge upgrade. I still get butterflies in my stomach when I use my phone even though it's an ""old"" phone. The phone feels so fast it's not even funny."
3495,"There is a presumably new S5 chip listed in the Series 5 technical specifications page, but I think most people are assuming it‚Äôs just a repackaged S4 chip from the Series 4.  Not sure if there are any real changes to the chip design."
3496,Correct.
3497,What is SoC?
3498,Apparently it's the same chip as the S4.
3499,I think that‚Äôs accurate
3500,I couldn't agree more. I also see how someone made a comment on how that would be irrelevant to 99% of the users which I don't believe would be true at all.
3501,"Same internals, except the compass and possibly a larger battery. I would personally get a cheap series 4, but you decide if always on matters enough to you."
3502,"The way I look at it, you'll have to replace the S2 eventually. The longer you hold onto it, the lower the value you'll get for it when you sell/trade for it. I would go with the S5 since it will last you many more years then the S4 will. That's just my 2 cents."
3503,"I'm on an S1 and I'm just going to get a used S4. A 44mm S5 is close to $460 with tax for me.

I can get a used S4 with cellular for $300 or less on sites like Swappa. Sure, it might have a few faint scratches from regular use but I don't really care.

You can also buy a refurbished S4 directly from Apple for $330.

Edit: Looks like the refurbished S4 is no longer in stock on apple.com"
3504,"I think a better comparison is: Cost √∑ years of expected use = yearly cost of ownership

In other words, if paying less nets you a device you'll want to upgrade sooner, then is it *really* cheaper?"
3505,"Depends entirely on if the always on screen is appealing to you.  It seems for most people it‚Äôs a very polarizing thing.  Either they want it so badly they‚Äôre willing to upgrade from a S4, or they don‚Äôt understand the appeal at all.

Most reviews I‚Äôve read, though, say the always on screen is a massive quality of life improvement."
3506,I‚Äôm in the same boat and it‚Äôs only a $50 difference between s4 and s5.
3507,"I‚Äôm on a 0, can‚Äôt wait to upgrade. I keep hearing about features I didn‚Äôt know existed."
3508,"Yea, going from a Series 0 to a 4 was monumental in battery life gains.

If you tried to track workouts with a series 0, the battery runs out after 2 hrs. And nothing lags anymore."
3509,was the performance from the S3 to S4 noticable? i'm going from a S2 to a S5 so I cant wait to see what ive been missing.
3510,Yep. I‚Äôm still on a Series 2.
3511,"The features / functions also tend to be less life changing. I would say upgrading every 3 years minimum, as someone who upgrades their iPhone every 1-2 years since the beginning."
3512,"All models (though Series 4 only IIRC, it‚Äôs not coming to S3 or below).

Though technically that face colour shown in the image is called ‚ÄòEdition‚Äô and only available on the Edition models, not that it makes a big difference."
3513,Two weeks would be amazing too then? What makes it easier to charge it weekly rather than every 2 days?
3514,damn you skipped 3D Touch!
3515,I‚Äôm on a series 0 üòÇ
3516,"The cases are all really dorky for the apple watch and completely ruin the look. They‚Äôre more acceptable on a phone because the phone isn‚Äôt as much of a fashion accessory as the watch is, and you‚Äôre more likely to drop your phone. Just wear the watch without a case, and get AppleCare for it if you think you‚Äôll damage it."
3517,"You can of course find cheaper watch case alternatives at Amazon and other retailers. But if you ""can't afford $35"" then I'd question if you can actually afford the watch at all. How much will it cost you to replace/fix if you do not opt for that bumper?

Are you opting instead of AppleCare? AppleCare+ is $79 and then you'd pay an additional $69 to use one of your ""accidental damage"" incidents. If you don't opt for AppleCare, the out of warranty replacement pricing starts at $299.

All of which is still more expensive than that $35 bumper."
3518,"I've been trying out a series 3 and series 4 the last few days (first time owner). The biggest difference for me is the speed. The series 4 opens apps instantly. The series 3 sometimes takes 2-5 seconds to open an app if it hasn't been used recently. I feel that when I want to use the watch for something, I want it to be a quick in and out, and the series 3 taking a few seconds to load an app really hinders that. Siri is also slightly slower on the 3.

As for the screen size difference, the UI does a great job hiding the edges of the display, so the series 3 never really feels like a square screen unless you are looking at pictures on it. I do enjoy the watch faces with the series 4 though. The rounded display gives many more options.

The series 5 is twice as expensive after taxes here in Canada than the series 3, which makes it hard to not see the series 3 as fantastic value. I think the series 3 would be a good choice given that you will be wearing it casually. Buy from somewhere with a good return policy and try them out."
3519,"At least they're starting to acknowledge the 2/3 year cycles

But yeah they should write the reviews for the perspective of someone who skipped one or multiple generations. Reading again and again that year over year upgrades at small is stupidly useless"
3520,"Yes, but you might as well buy a Series 4 because the always on display is really the only big upgrade over the 4. Other upgrades are minimal, and the processor is still the same."
3521,How much do you care about always on display?
3522,Got mine yesterday and had the 4. The always on display is a game changer. It‚Äôs more useful and better than I imagined it would be.
3523,">y

I think the S4 doesn't have the power saving circuitry to allow for an always on display even though it has the same screen."
3524,"No.

Variable refresh is a hardware feature of both the display controller and the panel itself. The series 4 uses a LTPS TFT backplane, while the series 5 uses a mix of LTPS and oxide TFT, the oxide providing always-on.

Good conspiracy theory though."
3525,"I have a series 2. I just wish it could multitask better. Having to wait 3-5 seconds for it to launch the workouts app every time I want to start a workout is tiresome. 

The screen turning off when I try to measure heart rate and making me start over each time is maddening. 

That said, I‚Äôm not upgrading until my watch is broken and failed or they have an all week battery life."
3526,"> I think the always on display is worth the upgrade from any series

I have a Series 3 and it's always on when I look at it. My first thought when they announced always on display was ""Oh I didn't realize that was ever a problem for anybody"". Good they did it for the people that want it but I hope they leave it as an option in settings so I can turn it off and squeeze a little more battery"
3527,Thanks! Is there anything in particular that has really improved from the zero to the four?Ôøº
3528,[deleted]
3529,I found the series 4 to be a lot quicker than the series 3 when launching apps. I‚Äôm struggling to get excited by the always on screen enough to consider upgrading to series 5.
3530,"Its pretty much a repackaged S4 with some new tweaks: W3 audio, compass, display controller and LTE models have new bands. Thats about it."
3531,With the App Store and the new storage capacity I think it‚Äôs seriously short sighted to underestimate needing additional storage on a computer watch.
3532,"I think your second sentence logic is a bit flawed... sure if you hold onto it longer it‚Äôll be worth less when you sell it, but you‚Äôll get more for your money when you actually buy a new one because prices go down over time in general, or better tech comes in at the same price."
3533,S5 and S4 have the same internals
3534,"Unless your the type that doesn‚Äôt sell your devices...I still have my iPod 4, iPhone 6, iPad 3, and 2011 MacBook Air, even though I‚Äôve upgraded all of those. 

The resale value is already so low for Apple watches that there‚Äôs really no point in selling them when you could just keep them and give them to someone else or just keep them.

Edit: to be fair tho most of those work really well still"
3535,You can still get them on Amazon or Walmart at discount
3536,I think I'm going that route also. want the stainless model but it's half the cost for a used s4 model.
3537,You won‚Äôt believe just how faster everything is. You‚Äôll be using your Ô£ø watch a lot more!
3538,"Exactly, I don‚Äôt even think about battery life anymore."
3539,"Same, and this year im making the jump to the S5, my battery only lasts till about 3pm (5:30-3:00) i was gonna go S4 but decided to hold out for 5ish more months."
3540,"Yeah, and it‚Äôs kind of wild to me the review acts like AoD was no big deal. That‚Äôs a major upgrade and I went from 0% interest in upgrading to pre-ordering the series 5 after seeing that.

Tech Enthusiasts always compare year over year, but Apple is primarily targeting people 2-3 years or behind."
3541,Yup.  Still rocking my S0.  Probably not for longer once I get the titanium S5.
3542,"The changes on the Apple Watch are literally more life changing than the iPhone, though. ECG is one example. The rumored sleep tracking, blood sugar monitoring etc in the future will only make that statement more true.

The new iPhone has... new cameras and faster FaceID."
3543,"Thanks, so only on Edition versions of S4 and above?"
3544,"I know... somehow both a little gutted I never got to use it, but also glad I won‚Äôt notice it as a regression. The idea of not having a home button or Touch ID is a bit weird too."
3545,I am on series none!
3546,"Thanks for the info much appreciated 

Yeah I feel the 3 will be ok for me and at ¬£200 I can justify not wearing it every day.

Good to see the watch getting better each year though, great piece of hardware."
3547,"I‚Äôm on a series three currently, and really don‚Äôt have a desire to upgrade, anyway. I was just curious about whether or not the feature could be turned off."
3548,[deleted]
3549,I‚Äôve found that [setting it to Single Metric in Workout settings help a little with the Workout app speed](https://i.imgur.com/yXPtgeV.jpg) *while* using it. Doesn‚Äôt start faster though.
3550,[deleted]
3551,"You should‚Äôve been around around here when the original was launched. And many other models after. Plenty of people complaining about the lack of always on screen. 
Personally I‚Äôm meh, nice to have but not game changing for me. 
I‚Äôll be running my S0 for another year."
3552,Already confirmed
3553,There an option to disable the always on display but I don‚Äôt know how much extra battery life you can get. It‚Äôll be interesting to see once it‚Äôs out
3554,I heard they're adding lag on wake for Series 3 so you'll appreciate their achievement more.
3555,"I gave my series 3 to my wife and replaced it with a Misfit, all because it wouldn‚Äôt always turn on and if I can‚Äôt tell the time then the watch is useless to me."
3556,">	An always on display with no drawback is a big deal too. 

From a hardware standpoint, all this means is they integrated a variable refresh rate display, which has existed in many other mediums (like 90hz+ phones) for a while now.

It‚Äôs a new display, but not a new design. 

I‚Äôm not arguing against upgrading to the S5 from the S4; I just think comparing it similarly to the jump between the S3 and S4 is unjustified.

Please note this is my opinion and my opinion shouldn‚Äôt affect your purchasing decision.

edit: to clarify my point, take a look at the S4‚Äôs display: it‚Äôs *objectively* better than the S3‚Äôs display. Is an always-on display objectively better than a not-always-on display? No - sure, having the option is objectively better, but the actual feature is subjective."
3557,Those things are pretty significant! Just because it isn't faster doesn't mean it isn't a major upgrade. It also has twice the space at 32Gb.
3558,What do you use storage for? I still don‚Äôt know what the Apple Watch is for if we‚Äôre being completely honest.
3559,32gb internal vs 16gb on series 4
3560,"S5 has a compass and the new ""always on"" display though."
3561,Same here! I‚Äôm kind of excited. Only a $50 difference between the s4 and s5.
3562,"I would argue that more people would benefit from the way better battery life than an ECG.

The watch has a lot of very neat stuff, but they all fit specific niches."
3563,There was no Edition model for Series 4.
3564,"For that specific watch face colour, yes. But the same California face is available on all S4 models (including non-Edition) in other colours."
3565,"Almost identical, but not identical. One has ""always on"" on the description, the other does not."
3566,"""It's their fault I make erroneous pronouncements about subjects I don't know much about!"""
3567,"Their marketing doesn't really have to differentiate since Apple is no longer selling the S4. If the S5 is the only option when walking into an Apple store, the average consumer doesn't really need to know if they're getting an LTPS TFT screen vs LTPS w/oxide TFT."
3568,Oh no issues while running the app at all. Just with getting it started.
3569,Good point
3570,"So, like an iOS update."
3571,What..? Having an always-on display is of course objectively better than not having one. Especially true when you consider that the primary purpose of a watch is to tell time.
3572,">It‚Äôs a new display, but not a new design.

I believe it is not even that, as the Series 4 also has an LTPO display. I believe it is the underlying hardware only which is different, which is why the Series 5 can do that sneaky 1Hz stuff."
3573,"To store music, pictures, apps, podcast, audiobooks, stuff like that. Mostly media. It‚Äôs helpful when you don‚Äôt have the cellular version and want to use your watch without your phone, for exercise or walking or whatever. I use mine like an iPod a lot, and love having all my stuff with me. But right now, my series 2 only has a few gigs of space for music.

And I‚Äôd bring my phone, but I opt for the nearly iPad sized max phones, and exercising with that in my pocket isn‚Äôt very fun."
3574,Which can be a huge plus for people that want more music/apps downloaded to their watches.
3575,Which is irrelevant to 99% of users
3576,Which will not make it last longer.
3577,"I‚Äôm not talking about what features more people could use, I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äúlife changing‚Äù new features."
3578,Thanks bud.
3579,">	Having an always-on display is of course objectively better than not having one. 

That‚Äôs what I said. The option to have the display always-on is objectively better than not having the option.

Is **using** the always-on display objectively better than not using it? No.

edit: the S4‚Äôs better display is something that **nobody** would turn off, hence it‚Äôs a real upgrade for **everyone**, not just many people as is the case with the S5."
3580,"This just confirms my belief that smart watches are gateway devices for phablets.  

Idk why people can‚Äôt decide what they want.  

One day we‚Äôll look back on gigantic phones like we look back on the giant gas guzzling SUVs from 2003-2005 that couldn‚Äôt fit in parking spaces."
3581,[deleted]
3582,"Well I had a big phone long before I had a watch. I‚Äôm not sure you could say one leads to the other. The extra space does help the situation.

I‚Äôm not sure what you are getting at, but I definitely know that I want a big ass phone. I have massive hands, and big pockets, and I want big videos and games, and a big keyboard. And I know that using another device instead of my phone for exercising is preferable. Even if I had an SE. There is no waffling going on."
3583,"I‚Äôm not sure what is so difficult to understand.

The original commenter complained about articles that say some devices aren‚Äôt a meaningful upgrade compared to last year‚Äôs model for everyone.

The jump from S3 to S4 was an upgrade for **literally everybody.** The jump from S4 to S5 is an upgrade **for only the people who want an always-on display. Nothing else has changed besides the addition of a compass.**

**Everybody** (within reason) wants a bigger display in the same form factor. You cannot say that **everybody** wants to use the always-on display, and so the jump from S4 to S5 is **less significant** for **most people** than the jump from S3 to S4 was.

The bold lettering isn‚Äôt to be annoying, it‚Äôs to emphasize the point I‚Äôve been trying to make."
3584,"I think they're arguing things like the additional battery drain this puts on the watch. For example, there's another commenter in this thread saying they would disable the always on display in favor of the slight increase to battery life. I figure for someone who values battery life over all else, the always on display is objectively worse."
3585,"The always-on display is dimmed when not raised, and lights up when raised. It‚Äôs a feature nearly everyone who buys it will use, since it is on by default meaning 90%+ of people will likely keep it on. Now, yes, 100% of users use the larger screen on the S4 since it‚Äôs a physical change, but that little bit of screen space on an already laughably small screen doesn‚Äôt make nearly as much of an impact on usability as a watch that is always on, like a real watch should be. 

The ability to glance at the time/weather/notifications from any angle at any time seems like a much bigger upgrade than being able to see more app icons in the app drawer, or having text be 10% larger. This is coming from someone with the S4."
3586,"Hey guys. Let's all agree the argument is really just about...money.

""I think it's worth the purchase because this money I lose when I purchase this thing is inconsequential to the happiness I gain from this new thing""

Coincidentally, it's easier to justify the purchase when you have **more** money.

When you have ^less money, it's less painful to justify not buying it. But you still want the new item, so you make the pain of not buying it less by rationalizing that it's not a worthwhile upgrade.

Who's right? Depends on your situation mostly. If you have at least $399 burning in your pockets, then sure. If you don't, then you either convince yourself that you don't need it, and/or you get miserable and argue with random strangers on Reddit.

Btw, I'm with the less money camp, so I just sit and sulk, and wait for next year."
3587,"Your missing a key thing.

Would I use an always on display if I had it? Yes, because I have it.  Do I care that my current watch doesn‚Äôt have an always on display.  Nope.

So there is no compelling reason for me to upgrade. Hell I‚Äôd even say that personally the compass is a bigger draw for me than the always on display."
3588,"Yeah, but that wasn‚Äôt the argument. Everyone has preferences, but I‚Äôm saying that an always on display isn‚Äôt a worse new feature than a slightly bigger screen was."
3589,"It looks like every color.  It‚Äôs visual perception tricks and depends on lighting, shadows, and surrounding colors"
3590,I only see white and gold.
3591,indeed nicer and less blue than we thought
3592,"Based on the bottom right picture, looks like under certain lighting, it‚Äôll have that blue shine. But, I kind of like that."
3593,So it was all a big fuss over nothing. It looks more black than space grey lol
3594,"Disappointing how few unique watch faces we still have access to. Idk what apple is holding out on for watch faces, unless theyre keeping it in their backpocket to have watch exclusive faces if sales are dipping if people arent upgrading every couple years"
3595,"Yeah, definitely relief. Those renderings were misleading, but I ordered one anyway."
3596,Apples colors always look different in person
3597,"I think it looks very much black, but shiny like black leather, I find it beautiful and I am hyped to get mine on friday :)"
3598,Yeah I will definitely upgrade my series 3
3599,I don't like the blue undertones.
3600,"I feel like I‚Äôm on my own wanting Apple to just stick with normal colours instead of trying to be whacky.

Aluminium: space grey, gold, silver
Stainless steel: graphite, gold, silver

The colours are making it less realistic to use the AW as a replacement for normal watches as they are looking like the goofy tech toy watches that they tried so hard to distance themselves from in the beginning."
3601,Unpopular opinion: do not like
3602,Give my space grey Nike edition back you violent bastards.
3603,"I have the midnight leather case (iPhone 13 Pro).

They didn't have a black option like I would normally get.

It's basically black. But the shadow detail color is blue instead of grey, black, or brown (orange). Under bright sunlight it gives off a blue tint.

It's nice if blue tones are your thing. It reflects the sky (sunlight/clouds) well."
3604,"From someone that has reviewed the Midnight color

3605,It is the same color as the aluminum edges of iPhone 13 midnight
3606,It‚Äôs just black with blue undertones. It‚Äôs kind of nice actually.
3607,"These are not real life images, reviewers have taken these under expensive daylight balanced soft lighting. 

I bought iPad mini in purple and it only looks it's advertised colour either under noon sun or under my expensive softbox lighting. 99% of time's it looks 90%  close to my space grey MacBook.

I hate the direction Apple has taken this year in regards to colours. If I am choosing a particular colour, I want it to look same in all types of lighting."
3608,Apple's photoshop person really dropped the ball this time. Midnight looked more blue than blue and the blue iPhone 13 looked more baby blue than sky blue.
3609,So glad I went for midnight
3610,Which reviews have this color? I know of Engadget but that's about it
3611,I feel much better about my decision having seen these images
3612,"Similarly, John Gruber says that the green Series 7 *also* looks black in most lighting (although he likes that):

[The anodized green aluminum is really dark‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâmuch darker in person than Apple‚Äôs product photography would suggest. It plays as black or near-black in most lighting conditions. I like this green watch much more in person than from how it looks on Apple‚Äôs website‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbecause it is so dark. If you‚Äôre hoping for a more verdant green, though, you might be disappointed. I highly suggest looking at‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand trying on‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe new watches in person, even if you‚Äôre already an Apple Watch owner.](https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/apple_watch_series_7)"
3613,I always want a dark colour and I really love blue but the blues are very overpowering.. so this is like the best of both worlds. I like this black / muted blue look
3614,The more and more I see the midnight s7 reviews the more and more I like the color personally it looks sleek asf
3615,"It‚Äôll probably only look blue in **direct** sunlight.

All in all, I really like the ~~black~~ *midnight* color for the aluminum models this year, it really looks a lot darker than before."
3616,Looks lit

3618,It‚Äôs nice I like it
3619,Can‚Äôt wait for it to get here. Mine arrives Tuesday!
3620,"I have to say that I like this color. If they keep it around for the series 8 or 9, I would choose it when I upgrade in the future."

3626,"Surprise it's blue.

And to everyone who say's it looks like a dark gray, it's blue."
3627,"Thanks! I‚Äôm so glad I canceled my order. This is pretty, but it‚Äôs not for me."
3628,"It would be fine if they also offered the base model in black. 

But they don‚Äôt. So this is worthless."
3629,Adding blue to black makes it even more black! I knew it would be fine!
3630,"I find it odd how the crown inside the circle has a different colour than the rest of the watch, especially obvious in the upper right picture"
3631,It‚Äôs definitely blue. You can‚Äôt convince me otherwise. I have the midnight iPhone case and the wallet and they‚Äôre both a VERY dark blue.
3632,Any link for midnight colour review?
3633,I wonder if it‚Äôs more or less blue than the charcoal braided solo loop. The bad has a light blue hue to it.
3634,"Still gotta see it in person because despite what we see in the images, all those who got the midnight said it was a very dark blue."
3635,I kind of want this now but I also really want the stainless steel graphite I ordered‚Ä¶..shit

3657,What colors are people getting with the gold that complements it?
3658,i think it depends on the lighting. blue's probably more noticeable outside or in bright lighting

3660,It‚Äôs black with a blue sheen.
3661,"If it's taught me anything, it's that the pictures provided by Apple will be too strong. I didn't like the way the Sierra Blue looked in the rendered images and then saw it IRL and it was way better than what I expected."
3662,But not black. Like everyone wants.
3663,"Agreed, except that it's blue."
3664,"This is purposely done lighting

No way they made midnight darker specficically for the watch"
3665,It‚Äôs going to match my blue iPhone 12 real nice.
3666,That pic looks like the blue and not Midnight. Maybe OP or someone else can clarify.
3667,I think you're just seeing the blue daylight reflecting from a nearby window or daylight LED lamp.
3668,Yeah I was so scared of the hint of blue but it‚Äôs pretty space grayish with just a hint of blue in certain lights. And idk why but this color make me think of Batman lol
3669,"The band though, is pretty blue to me. So waiting for the black band to come back was a good call on my part."
3670,if only they‚Äôd just fucking share real world images from the start
3671,Lmao I know right they fuss about everything what apple releases every single time.
3672,"Disagree. It‚Äôs definitely blue, although a quite dark shade and thus darker than space gray but not as classy as true black. In broad daylight this will most definitely be even more noticeable. https://youtu.be/mLwVeGK0ViA"

The idea that I can buy a nike band, and not use a Nike watch face is just corny. Why do I need to buy the base aluminum version to access that. Same with Hermes"

It's literally navy blue in person"
3681,"You aren‚Äôt. Colors are pretty IMO, but I can‚Äôt make them work on an everyday basis. I gotta be able to wear this watch in a multitude of situations. I have a variety of bands that help me do this. I get offering colors in the workout aluminum option, but even still people want neutral options."

3691,You mean midnight?
3692,It depends on what Watch you have. I have the Series 3 and the features have stacked pretty well so this is the year for me. Series 5 and 6 I‚Äôd say isn‚Äôt worth an upgrade

3702,Did Tim Cook write this?
3703,They‚Äôre all the Midnight band matching the watch.
3704,*Laurel and Yanny intensifies*
3705,It is more of a blueish shine. And less visible with some band colors. Hard to capture in pics.
3706,"Yeah, the bottom right pic where it‚Äôs reflecting the most light it looks very blue."
3707,"Definitely darker than space gray. I could tell that by the renders. But bluer too. lol

But not *as* blue as I thought. I'm pleased."
3708,"It depends on which [*Space Gray*](http://i.imgur.com/k2M9VMc.jpg) you mean.

[Another pic. ](https://images.ifun.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/spacegrey.jpg)"
3709,yea i know right!! haha
3710,"Here is a comparison of Space Grey and Midnight 
https://i.imgur.com/qSTkcFM.jpg
https://youtu.be/Kxa1lVTFwUo"
3711,It's navy blue
3712,You mean navy blue
3713,Not me. I love a deep bluish black. Jet black and dark gray are pedestrian colours.
3714,Isn't the blue a lot more bright?
3715,"All of the pics were taken from the Midnight review videos from today. That screenshot was under extreme light from what i remember, almost like flashing a light directly at the watch"
3716,Blue sky doesn‚Äôt reflect off a black surface like that. This is the paint job
3717,"holly crap batman, its not as blue as i thought"
3718,I wanted a slate colour like the iPhone 5. Honestly kinda sad.
3719,"I mean he is definitely using very bright and direct lights in that video, and as other people have said under direct sunlight I imagine you would see a more blueish tinge, but I doubt it will be noticable under most use cases"
3720,Look at it in normal lighting and it'll basically look black.
3721,"Everyone is saying it looks black, not space grey üôÉ"
3722,"There was a jailbreak tweak from iOS 10 that unlocked those Nike and Hermes faces on all watches. Unfortunately that exploit has been patched so it doesn‚Äôt work on any new devices or OSs. But they‚Äôre all there in the software, just blacklisted."
3723,"They may think there's more money to be made in exclusivity vs total saturation. 

That said, I am *entirely* in your camp."
3724,"I would say probably for the same reason you can buy knock off airpods / beats from China, and your iPhone recognises and interacts with them as if they were a fully legitimate pair."
3725,Yeah I went with a midnight S7 and now I can‚Äôt wait to see it with my Nomad Modern Band in Rustic Brown. [This watch](https://i.imgur.com/bE1ojXv.jpg) is one of my favs in my collection and Space Gray Apple Watches could never recreate the look.
3726,I copped the midnight and new brown leather. Gonna see which one looks better.
3727,"Why didn't you just get a space grey 7? They call it graphite.

Oh! Unless, you wanted aluminum. Also, I think they make a dark grey titanium version ü§î"
3728,"Yeah, it‚Äôs not about liking or disliking. It‚Äôs about what what being advertised and what being delivered."
3729,"41mm Nike Midnight with Nike Midnight/Mystic Sport Band 

I wanted to get regular 41mm Midnight with Deep Navy or Abyss Sport Loop but those band colors were sold out, so I went Nike

[Picture](https://imgur.com/a/y12gL0r)"
3730,"It's blue. Congratulations, you're colorblind."
3731,"its navy blue

Same color/tone as the midnight iphone 13

it's ugly"
3732,Because I want one. I had a 5 before the 6. üíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3733,If you so say so??? Don‚Äôt know why you are trying to argue about how I interpret a color.üòÇ Trying to be a downer? Or do just have nothing better to do.
3734,"I know, it throws me off a little bit how it's differently coloured. Is this the same on the S6 as well or did the graphite SS have a graphite electrode as well for example?"
3735,The iPhone 13 in midnight isn‚Äôt navy blue in person and neither is this no matter how many dozen comments you reply to insisting it is. If anything their lighting makes it look more blue. Just to even get the *slightest hint* of dark blue from the 13 you basically need to be in full sun.
3736,No why üòÇ
3737,"Thanks! Loving the blue undertones in the band, might have to check it out."
3738,I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúvery‚Äù personally. If someone told me that was a photo of a black watch I would 100% believe them.
3739,darker than any space gray i would say
3740,Primarily referring to the space grey from the Apple Watches before the Series 7.
3741,[deleted]
3742,"Not even close.  A Midnight blue yes, but not Navy."
3743,"Yeah, that‚Äôs kind of my point. That one picture looks nothing like the others. I have a blue series 6, and that picture in the bottom right looks =/>  than mine in terms of brightness."
3744,The blue aluminum Apple Watch is the same as the edges on the blue iPhone 13 (non-pro)
3745,It most certainly does. Ever seen literally anything black and shiny?
3746,I agree. The lighting can really change how it looks. For my bands it will work just fine.
3747,Even in that lighting I only see the blue when I‚Äôm really looking for the blue
3748,"It's neither

It's literally navy blue"
3749,No way ! I‚Äôd actually jailbreak in that case. I haven‚Äôt jalibroken since iOS 12‚Ä¶.
3750,"fuck i didn‚Äôt realise you had to buy the watch from the nike portion on the site to get those faces, i thought you‚Äôd just get them by downloading the nike run club app or something. bit annoyed now, would have liked to have them and would‚Äôve bought my watch from the nike part if i‚Äôd known that."
3751,"You can do this with the MagSafe compatible devices too! And they work fine. It doesn‚Äôt make sense they‚Äôve worked around that- I think they‚Äôve signed exclusive deals with the collab companies that the faces are software locked to block replicas- 

It‚Äôs the companies like Nike and Hermes who are the problem in my eyes"
3752,That‚Äôs what I got too lol.
3753,"nomad leather band is one of the best out there, great choice mate"
3754,"third party dark brown leather band would look better i think, not a big fan of apple leather band"
3755,I need to get a light yellow brown band to match my blue suit / belt and shoe combo
3756,"Yeah dude, the price difference is not worth it. I actually prefer the 6 for a few reasons: 1) color (space gray) to go with my expensive strap, 2) slightly smaller size (40), and 3) cost: 6 is already on sale for $50+ less at several retailers. I‚Äôm upgrading from the 3 so it‚Äôs all a huge upgrade for me."
3757,Stop it you meanie! Its black with a hint of blue. Be kind
3758,I just dislike the color that much
3759,"No you don't.

The Navy blue color is clear as day in the Apple store and in any lighting in person

Only time it looks black is when there is 0 light. Any color is black by then tho"
3760,Sorry was just busting your chops! Your original comment just screamed like it was from Tim Cook himself ‚Äúthis is our best Apple Watch yet‚Äù
3761,I was really afraid of the blue tones by the promo material. It actually looks quite nice looking at these images. Im hoping Apple carry this over to all of the Apple products so we get get them matching.
3762,lol you would be fucking blind then or you need a properly calibrated display.
3763,"In space, no one can see what's gray"
3764,"In person it's literally navy blue

The only picture in the post that shows close to the true color you will see is the bottom left comparison picture"
3765,No way that bottom right is the same color as the rest. Has to be the blue
3766,"Its not about what it literally is, its about what it is perceived to be bud"
3767,"It‚Äôs a shame that it‚Äôs locked to iOS versions, because I had on iOS 12 a S0 that was running watchOS 4, which was supposed to support the tweak‚Ä¶but alas needs both devices to line up"
3768,"Thanks, I love nomads other products I‚Äôm super excited! I think it‚Äôs a good combo for my first Apple Watch too"
3769,"I like the look of it, but haven't seen it in person. The Bullstraps are pretty nice."
3770,"Apple‚Äôs leather is just kinda weird in general, I have a leather link and also a 12 Mini case and while the strap is much better, neither comes even close to my ‚Ç¨40 Hermes copy strap from Etsy lol."
3771,The new brown Apple leather looks orange in a lot of the photos. I think last year's brown and black were nicer.
3772,Then uh‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get it?
3773,"Think you meant bottom right.  But, yea it still looks grey/black in that pic to me.   Will have to see it in person when I get it tomorrow."
3774,"It‚Äôs not the blue, the blue this year is a lighter blue and the midnight is a black/blue hue. That is def not the blue. Way to dark"
3775,a day to go!!
3776,"This whole post is about the  midnight(navyblue) colorway

Not about buying it

If you like the Navy Blue color they just released

Buy it"
3777,"No.

Bottom right is very far from the actual color. It's the lighting and nothing but lighting tricks on the bottom right"
3778,"Goodness, go find a hobby."
3779,"Reddit IS a hobby

You go find a hobby"
3780,"Looking at your profile, I guess this place is your one and only hobby. Good on you for finding a place to vent about being referred to as ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù while in a relationship."
3781,Yes because personal attacks are on topic in this discussion because youre so emotionally invested into a company you feel the need to defend it
3782,"Funny thing about the internet is that I am not emotionally invested in anyway, it was just extremely easy to make that comment. You laid it all out there for me. No work required."
3783,"You mean like the Apple watch and switch are your only hobby?

So you make yourself feel better by putting other's hobbys down?

Gj you must feel so proud of yourself"
3784,Really? All that time and that‚Äôs the best response you could make?
3785,Likewise
3786,"> It's now Watch OS5, which all Apple Watches are getting now

\*cries in series 0*"
3787,"As an android user, this thing makes me jealous.  Google has pretty much abandoned the smart watch field."
3788,This watch finally made me want a new one after having the series 0 for years
3789,[deleted]
3790,This was a pretty good review 
3791,"I‚Äôve never seen someone where the watch upside down with the crown&button on the inside before. How would you even use that, curl your finger across the watch body every single time?"
3792,"I was thinking about buying one of these for my father that has heart issues, but no ECG outside US turned me down "
3793,I‚Äôm debating asking for this for Christmas ...
3794,"As a car guy, I noticed he had one or two bits wrong about the NSX. Otherwise, fairly decent review. "
3795,Fuck Android and QC. Kudos to Apple  (I guess Samsung too) for innovating the Smart watch
3796,Of course.
3797,[deleted]
3798,I cringed when I read the title
3799,"Another incorrect fact in an MKBHD video that could‚Äôve been answered by a Google search?? I‚Äôm shocked.

Edit: Really? Downvotes? It‚Äôs very well known, especially on this sub, that he frequently cites wrong facts about products in his videos."
3800,"S0 is so slow nowadays and the S4 has prompted me to upgrade. With every software update my S0 was getting slower and slower that it‚Äôs only use is just telling the time. 

I think Watch OS5 would have been even worse on it. "
3801,"My S0 is in pristine condition and batt still lasts all day. It‚Äôs time to upgrade though, the S4 is just too good to wait another year."
3802,"Me too, but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going to get a series 4. It‚Äôs finally a good time to upgrade."
3803,I'm switching tomorrow morning to iOS for the first time ever in no small part because of that watch :)
3804,That's why I got the versa. I use it mostly for fitness tracking. When I need to respond to texts and stuff I use my old gear S2.
3805,Apple are going to have wearables figured out (watch and AR glasses) while Android manufacturers are still going to be focusing on getting the notch right. 
3806,Plus tablet 
3807,"I still have a series one watch. I bought it when I quit my shitty job to pursue a better career. That was years ago and it‚Äôs still holding up. Never put a case on it, though, so it‚Äôs absolutely covers in dents and scratches."
3808,Now that the Apple Watch is getting too much PR you can be sure google will launch a half-assed Pixel Wrist pretty soon. 
3809,Why?
3810,It‚Äôs become glaringly obvious to me that Google wants to be seen as Apples direct competitor as they follow all of apples moves to the market. 3 new pixels are rumored to come out and I would wager they will step forward into the watch game sooner or later to get closer to that goal.
3811,Hoping I‚Äôll has this one as long as he Series 0‚Äôs out there. Never had one before. Enjoy. 
3812,Same!
3813,I have an S3 and want the new one
3814,I want to upgrade but they keep making WatchOS run faster and smoother on my Series 0. 
3815,"UVI here in India is almost always at a 10 so is essentially irrelevant :/

Edit: It's a 11 here today."
3816,I'm from LA- what is that?
3817,My skin color also makes it pretty irrelevant to me.
3818,"Use your thumb, like he does in the video multiple times...? It's actually much easier to navigate with the crown that way."
3819,"I do this as the watch sits close to my hand on my wrist no matter what I do and if I bend my hand back it would press the crown button. It drove me nuts until I flipped it around. 

I think it‚Äôs just the way my wrist is and the bands can‚Äôt hold it from getting to close to my hand. "
3820,"Right? Guys normally wear their watch on their left hand but even then, you can change the orientation in settings so the crown faces your hand. It's a very odd position."
3821,[deleted]
3822,"I sometimes do that. I use my thumb. It was quiet nice, especially when talking into the microphone but now that‚Äôs no longer needed with the microphone‚Äôs new placement on the Series 4."
3823,I have it on my left wrist but I have the crown away from the hand as well. It works better for me.
3824,"Yeah it‚Äôs a bit of a bummer, but it is meant to start rolling out to other countries in the coming months."
3825,Calm down mate.
3826,"What? MKBHD has always been very critical about a lot of the stuff and decisions Apple makes. In fact, he has stated multiple times that he actually prefers Android. Definitely not a ""yes guy"" for Apple, but I agree with you about Jonathan Morrison even though I like his videos."
3827,Lol what. MKBHD calls out apple on a whole bunch of stuff all the time. Are you sure you‚Äôre talking about the right person?
3828,I cringed when I read this comment. 
3829,"No, you‚Äôre right. I like his videos but he gets a lot of things factually wrong, there‚Äôs no debating that. "
3830,I really loved MKBHD until he started reviewing cars when he got his Tesla. That was when I realized he makes a lot of these errors and then I started to notice it in other videos and it ruined the magic.
3831,Guy seems to make enough to hire a fact checker for his scripts. 
3832,I was the guy that made the post about it that went kinda viral here. Still feel bad about it but... if he keeps making mistakes I‚Äôll slowly lose that feeling. 
3833,"Well to be fair, at WWDC, I don‚Äôt think Apple stated watchOS 5 isn‚Äôt coming to series 0 and he probably doesn‚Äôt pay really close attention to Apple Watch news to find out that fact. I personally didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt coming to series 0 either, but I do agree he should research more before stating something as a fact. I just think this was too minor of fact for him to be bothered to look up."
3834,"He's a youtube star, he makes good videos and reviews phones but is by no means ""an expert."" Just a dude with a $60k camera, an office in Jersey, a sweet car, and a couple million followers."
3835,Look at this guy. He never makes mistakes.
3836,He really have lost it. So many untruths in every review now
3837,"Yet iOS 12 saved even older phones from the scrap heap, in line with their policy of longevity. Just saying. "
3838,Same here. Been on Android since 2009
3839,Are you getting an XS tomorrow? 
3840,"If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, why are you switching?"
3841,The new Samsung watch looks pretty nice.  I may pick one up up but still...this Apple watch 4 is generations ahead.  Really cool tech.  
3842,that branding on watch face tho üôà
3843,That 4-5 day battery charge is amazing. I also bought a Versa and love it. I can‚Äôt wait for Apple to get that a 1.5 day battery is not acceptable...especially when you wear one over night and go to workout early. Want that sleep tracking and no need to charge and go feeling. 
3844,I really want (normal looking) glasses to be a thing. There‚Äôs a massive amount of potential there.
3845,Pretty sure series 0 isn't getting the new watchOS...
3846,Ultra violet index... like basically telling you if you can get sunburnt or not 
3847,I thought it just takes longer to burn.
3848,It's not just your wrist. It's a very common issue.
3849,I‚Äôm fairly tempted to do the same. I inadvertently invoke Siri at least a few times per day.
3850,Mine still does that with it the other way.
3851,He just has it setup wrong. He is a lefty and has it setup for a righty. 
3852,I‚Äôm probably going to use the left arm orientation for a bit after spraining my wrist from a bike fall. Just tried it with my S0 and it feels weird. But I want to use my S4 when it arrives tomorrow.
3853,It lowers it. You can still hit the button with your arm though.
3854,By the speed my government does stuff i expect it to be approved by 2050
3855,"His production values? ‚úÖ Top notch.

His factual accuracy? .... notch. ‚ôøÔ∏è"
3856,"I only notice the Apple stuff he gets wrong cause that‚Äôs what I know most about, but does he also get a lot of Google/Android facts wrong? I presume that since he prefers Android that he would probably get more of the facts right in those videos."
3857,"It's a pretty common phenomenon for youtubers who make it big to pump out higher quantity, lower *content* quality videos. Also as they become more mainstream, they almost have to cater to a wider, more average consumer audience.

*cough cough, linus tech tips and his clickbait trash. In all fairness, he did man up and straight out say that he is doing it for the money and youtube algorithms almost force his hand."
3858,I‚Äôm not really a car guy so I can‚Äôt catch his mistakes but what kind of facts does he get wrong in his car videos?
3859,"I can forgive it pretty easily. Even though a lot of YouTubers are arguably more famous than many TV personalities, they are undervalued in the market and aren‚Äôt able to hire the same level of team to support their content. 

So without that support, things will be missed occasionally. MKBHD travels to every launch event and interview in person, uses the products, writes the script, then films and edits the videos. 

He does have a bit of extra help now, but he is still crazy busy, so some mistakes will be made. 

It‚Äôs easy for us tech-nerds to pick out mistakes in the final video because we only see 4-15 minutes of the hours and days that go into filming and writing, and our minds are fresher with facts on the content. 

"
3860,"I still love it just because of the insane filming quality he has, more recently with that robot arm. Man! Just watch the intro on the IPhone XS v√≠deo and you‚Äôll understand what I‚Äôm saying"
3861,Wish I could afford a Tesla from YouTube revenue lol
3862,Not after buying that much RED hardware!
3863,Check my post a couple comments up. He's kept making many mistakes since your post.
3864,And he replied to you... yet seems to continue making the same mistakes.
3865,"It wasn‚Äôt announced at WWDC, but it was clearly listed on their website immediately after, and all of the typical Apple sites quickly reported on it.

The problem is he has a history of little inaccuracies like this in his videos, and they add up."
3866,When did I say he was an expert?
3867,"Not in videos that I research that are watched by millions of people, no. YouTube is literally his job."
3868,I was a huge Android fanboy until I got the iPhone SE. I was shocked how smooth everything was. 
3869,"XS Max, Silver ^^ you?"
3870,Definitely
3871,"I do REALLY like my Gear S3, but it's got nothing on my wife's Watch Series 2. Though, the Gear S3 does have sleep tracking and a true ""Do Not Disturb"" mode. It makes it a GREAT alarm for me as a light sleeper. I have it set to a silent alarm with vibration enabled and that's all I need to wake up in the morning and don't have to worry about disturbing her. Also, the battery life is a bit better than hers. I'm not sure if Apple has improved in that regard since Series 2."
3872,"It‚Äôs super subtle, but they definitely need to get rid of it."
3873,Ah damn. Well maybe it‚Äôs finally time then. 
3874,Its not but the latest WatchOS 4 is crazy stable on my series 0 these days. 
3875,Not to be confused with the ultra violent index. Which tells you... well..
3876,"We get sunburned, it just takes A LOT for us to get to the point that we're in pain and peeling. You're essentially right, but no logical person with significant melanin is going to be outside in direct sunlight for 12+ hours (that's how long it took me to get to ""peeling point"" out in west Texas. Stupid I know).

Tldr: People of fairer tones burn very easily, we don't. It takes prolonged, more extreme exposure."
3877,"There is no wrong. You wear it as you like it. When pairing, you're asked how you wear it."
3878,[deleted]
3879,Brazil too? 
3880,"He's a human, he makes mistakes. Of course an entire community will catch them all and point them out, it's so minor. Give him a break."
3881,It's usually only Apple stuff.
3882,"He gets Android stuff wrong too occasionally, but it's usually stuff that's very easily googled."
3883,"Linus irritates me almost as much as Louis Rossman, who complains bitterly about Apple devices but literally runs a business repairing... Macbooks!"
3884,"Well, on floatplane you get proper titles, and no ads. "
3885,"> youtube algorithms almost force his hand

Yeah... I call bullshit on that

"
3886,"Let‚Äôs take the NSX review. He spent the vast majority of time talking about how hard it was to live with a supercar. How low it is, etc. The NSX is one of the most livable supercars. It‚Äôs got a more plush suspension than some $30,000 sedans. It‚Äôs got a tiny engine compared to a most things in its price range. And MKBHD did a shit job of driving on track (which is why the instructor had a BMW and was leading).

Apple Car play review? Let‚Äôs go to Florida to film a Lamborghini that has an old model that doesn‚Äôt have Android Auto to contrast. Compare it to the Straight Pipes review with a Kia: https://youtu.be/_MDl6xKTU9s

They do a far more in-depth testing while being able to actually see what‚Äôs going on the screen.

I love MKBHD, but he‚Äôs owned 1 car. And it shows."
3887,"I haven't actually watched his car videos, but I'm going to assume they are extremely basic, mundane, barely noticeable but also about incredibly easy-to-fact-check things just like in his Apple videos. Stuff like 'does this car have a spare tire' or 'how much horsepower this car has' or 'is it gasoline direct injected' etc"
3888,"I totally get it, I just wish since he put so many hours into making, editing, etc, that he could, or have someone else, spend the 4-15 minutes making sure the numbers are right.

Once you have 100k subscribers you get access to a ton of cool shit and support from YouTube including managers, editors, and access to filming studio sets so you don‚Äôt have to film in your home, they make a mock-up at the YouTube creators studio.

He doesn‚Äôt need to put all of the pressure on himself, he has access to help."
3889,"Oh yeah, his cinematography has always been amazing. That was one of the reasons I started watching his videos."
3890,I don‚Äôt think he really pays attention to that kinda stuff cause it‚Äôs not really interesting or important to him but he probably still should fact check before claiming a fact.
3891,"Your complaint seems to be ""he frequently cites wrong facts about products."" I'm just asking what one's expectations of a YouTube streamer should be."
3892,The SE was smoother than my S8. 
3893,"If you haven‚Äôt updated to iOS 12 yet, you should. It feels much more buttery than 11. I can see the SE lasting another 2-3 years easily."
3894,"Awesome! Hope you enjoy :)

I‚Äôm getting an XS Space Grey"
3895,">	A true ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode

Can you explain? My father has the Gear S3 but I didn‚Äôt find something that the S3 had over the Apple Watch in terms of DND features"
3896,"Really? I don't use Siri because it says ""I'll tap you when I'm ready..."" For about half a minute, opening any app takes forever, and when I try to use voice dictation for text it doesn't work half the time. "
3897,"[*Boots up Doom 95*](https://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/d/doom-ii-2pd/doom-ii_3.gif)

UVIndex: Yes"
3898,"Ohhhh, that‚Äôs when the heart sensor detects an aggravated Rhythm and the gyroscope notices that your arm is in the backhand position"
3899,I literally trigger Siri accidentally on the watch 20+ times a day during the week.
3900,"Dude. His job is to accurately review new technology. If my lawyer constantly made minor mistakes, I would fucking fire them."
3901,"But those are usually just facts that you could find anywhere else, what really matters is what he describes his experience was and how good he thought the product was."
3902,"Louis often has valid points about the designs, but the problem is that no matter what brand you repair, you're going to face some designs where they just had to work around issues with less optimal design. I've repaired Thinkpads. They're nice and modular but every now and then one of those ""what were you guys thinking"" moments happen."

3906,"When reviewing a product, it hurts your credibility to frequently get facts wrong. Several people here said they no longer watch him because they can‚Äôt believe him anymore.

What point does he make about board repair that aren't valid? Should you not have the right to repair your own devices?"
3921,"They dont. 

iJustine is a pretty small channel for the content she makes. "
3922,Really? How were you able to tell it was a fingerprint or dust particle and not actually the camera. I find that his other camera reviews were really good.
3923,"Most reviewers (not just MKBHD) have preferred the Pixel 2, though..."
3924,"I can understand why people are concluding that the Pixel 2 has the better camera. From the comparison shots I've seen the Pixel looks to still show a fair amount more detail on the main focal point vs the Xs. However, as a Pixel 2 owner I'm starting to notice that most of my shots (especially in portrait mode) are actually over sharpened. On the one hand this isn't such a bad thing since it does the sharpening really well, but on the other hand I don't think it always looks true to life as a result. 

The real problem I see with the Xs and moreso the X is the method of noise reduction Apple applies in their processing. It tends to muddy up details. From what I've seen this is significantly better on the Xs, but still could use some work.

But here's the real question. If we're focusing on the issue of fine detail can we objectively say which one is better? As a Google branded phone user I've always been in the camp of the more detail the better under all circumstances. However, with the introduction of the Xs I'm really not so sure anymore. I think what I'd really love is something in the middle here. Better detail than the Xs, but less sharpening than the typical Pixel shot."
3925,Many people put a lot of faith into what they say. That‚Äôs why they have such a large following.

3972,"Great review. I recognize that these are your opinions, but my comments anyway:

> Battery life has been fantastic when raise to wake is disabled...

> While it works 95% of the time I want it to work, it also lights up the screen when I don't want to, especially while running. 

Always on display is a requirement for me. I want to see something there always. I just need the watch to get me through the day, and, for me, charging while I eat breakfast and shower (times I am not active anyway) and an hour before bed (again, times that I am winding down) is more than good enough. I always go to bed with 100% charge, and have plenty left at the end of even a 2 hour workout.

I couldn't stand it when I had the S2 and went for a run and couldn't see the data on the screen - raise to wake worked only sometimes, and I'd have to exaggerate the motion or tap the display to see stats. AOD is so much better IMO. I won't get another watch without it (unless Apple stops making them with AOD - unlikely).

> Apple Health syncs everything between all the health related apps, but it does not seem to detect duplicates. While you can disable write permissions for one of both apps, it would be nice if duplicates were detected and removed.

For my indoor cycling workouts (just as an example), I have a cycling computer that syncs with an app on my iPhone (and Apple Health) at the same time the cycling workout from the watch syncs. However, I do not get duplication in total exercise time or any of the rings. (I keep both because the workouts app doesn't capture cadence or distance for indoor workouts while the Wahoo app can report that.)

> Limited storage capacity. With only four 3rd party apps installed, my watch won't install WatchOS updates complaining there's too little storage space. Having to unpair your watch, update and restore from a backup gets old very quickly.

That's really only an issue for older S3 older watches, FWIW. I understand that it sucks if you have an older S3 with a small amount of storage, but the newer watches have plenty more storage and no issues with updating.

> The activity goals are the same for every day, and they're always absolute and not relative. 

I'd also love to see smarter goals, and a recognition of easy days and rest days, and even injuries and injury recovery, with recover plans, etc. However, I think the ring motivation is meant for people who are new to Apple Watch and have not exercised regularly in the past, to try to get them to make daily exercise and movement a habit. I respect that and frankly I don't really care if I don't meet the move goal - I have a workout schedule and don't really need the watch to motivate me to get it done. (Frankly, what I probably need the watch to do is to recognize when maybe I've been doing too much and maybe it's time to rest or take it easier.)"
3973,"As for the raise to wake, the only reason I keep that on is that when I get a notification, I don‚Äôt want to have to touch the screen to see the notification.  

Basically if I could see notifications with raise to wake but otherwise have that feature disabled so it‚Äôd not randomly turning on the screen, that would be perfect!"
3974,"This is a great review. Series 3 owner here for almost a year, and I pretty much agree 100% with everything you mentioned."
3975,"I think the Fitness app on iOS is very poor and unusually constricted in usage options, imo, but that's fortunately pretty easy to fix with exporting to other apps/services. 

My S5 have started losing my heart rate for 1-5 minutes during my runs. It's almost never for a majority of a run, so at the moment I'm not too annoyed, just a little perplexed. Well, my previous Forerunner instead often just showed my heart rate at ""sitting"" rate when I was trying to run at a decent speed (I am not an experienced runner), so I guess a wrong heart is more annoying than no measurement. 

""Sleep"" have given me some weird sleep and wake up times when I tried it, so for that I use the Forerunner instead. 

So yeah, I agree with your assessment of the AW,"
3976,I‚Äôm concerned about the inaccuracy of the heart rate monitor during hard workouts. Today it was 10-15BPM low at times. Is anyone using a chest strap instead? Are chest straps compatible?
3977,Interesting read üëç.
3978,"> I'd also love to see smarter goals, and a recognition of easy days and rest days, and even injuries and injury recovery, with recover plans, etc

Yes, same. I'd happily pay a premium for that, too. 

Something between the apple watch and the woop band. You know, the hardware of the apple watch but with things like the recovery score for woop (if you are familiar). Just something that aggregates some kind of score based the exercise you've done over the last week and your rest/sleep.

And of course 'rest days' would be good for the AW. I'm currently training for Audax cycling, so I might do 250km in one go then nothing for 2 days. Doesn't really seem fair that I'll have done 7,000kcal+ on a Saturday and then not reach my move goal on a Sunday or Monday and then be made to feel guilty (or worse, feel like I'm overtraining by doing anything on those rest days). 

On the sleep schedule you can customise every day, the move/exercise/stand being along the same lines would be a big change."
3979,"Interesting remarks, thanks.

Does the always on display also work with 3rd party (fitness) apps, or is it limited to the Apple Workout app?

Hmmm, might me be that I have some settings set up badly that is causing the duplicates.

Good to know that when I upgrade the limited storage capacity will no longer be an issue.

I agree, smarter goals recognizing easy and rest days would be another interesting implementation. I do concur, the ring motivation might be targeted towards a different topic. Nevertheless, it feels a bit annoying that I can't always close all the rings while I do feel I live an active lifestyle."
3980,*losing
3981,"Yes, I have used a chest strap.  The heart rate monitoring does not go grey is more stable when using it.  I have not used it in a while but it has worked well when I have."
3982,"Yes, I have used both a Wahoo Tickr and Polar H9 chest strap with the Apple watch. As soon it's connected via bluetooth, the heart rate readings are coming from the chest strap instead of the watch. You can confirm this by using the heart rate app. If you get an instant reading, it's coming from the strap and not the watch. Another way is to log a workout, go to the Health app, and under Heart Rate you'll find ""Show All Data"". Most workout apps will mention your chest strap as the source. Some apps just mention the app as a source, regardless of whether or not you're using a chest strap."
3983,"> Does the always on display also work with 3rd party (fitness) apps, or is it limited to the Apple Workout app?

For right now, it is limited to the stock Workouts app. I am really hoping that Apple soon has an always on API for third party apps so that all of them can have a way to show some relevant information at a glance rather than just the time in the corner with a blurred background."
3984,"Ahh is this the case? I was wondering what I was doing wrong.

I Fiit app would always display the time if I lowered my hand but going for a run with Apple fitness (or whatever the standard Apple workout app is called) would always keep the workout stats up.

Agreed with AOD, I wouldn‚Äôt of purchased it without."

>Apple Watch also notifies you via different sounds and through vibration using the Taptic Engine. Each type of notification has a different feel. Once you learn these taptic patterns, it helps you know the type of notification before you even look at it. A good example of this was the Maps experience. When walking down the street to a meeting in San Francisco, I used the Watch to guide me there. The Apple Watch has a different taptic pattern for going left and for going right. This way, I didn‚Äôt need to lift my wrist to look at the display to know which way to go. The implications of these different types of notifications based on feel are unexplored territory.

i prefer the aluminum ones because the apple watch is best suited for fitness tracking and the lighter weight is nice, as is the screen being less prone to cracking compared to the sapphire crystal on the more expensive models. but i'm also someone who prefers wearing a 'real' watch when i'm not working out."
4034,The Ti will probably show less wear but it looks most similar to the aluminum models. The real benefit in my opinion of the SS or Ti is the sapphire crystal. Tougher and more scratch resistant.

I still don't understand why they don't have a widget to control the Galaxy Buds+ via the watch, or a smart playback detection feature to automatically put playback and volume controls on the primary watchface whenever you're listening to something so I can adjust the volume with my watch instead of double tapping the edges of my Buds+ or pulling out my phone.

The battery life is insane, I get 2 full days of use WITH constant heart rate monitoring turned on, I could get more if I changed it to just monitor every 10 minutes but I also want the Stress monitoring and that requires constant HR updates."
4045,"Oppo Watch, sounds like Apple Watch somewhat, right?"
4046,"Just because it looks like an Apple Watch, doesn‚Äôt make it an Apple Watch. Nor does it make it as good as one."
4047,I have bought the Chinese version just last week. Ordered it and 2 days later they announced they where going to release it to europe. But works perfectly here in Belgium. But no WearOs.. only ColorOs
4048,Makes me wish the Galaxy Watches ran WearOS or at least had better 3rd party app support.
4049,Chinese brands destroying the image of Android again with their copycat cheap ass products.
4050,No one should buy a wearos device
4051,"Oppo - *""Hey, is it alright if I borrow some things from your project?"" -* Watch"
4052,"""global""  but no usa release, huh.... Oh well"
4053,1gig for a watch is nice!
4054,"This is good, works with the google fit app better than the galaxy watch so I don't have to use the stupid s health app with ads in it"
4055,Android is really broad
4056,Can you buy the oppo watch yet? Any reason it wouldn't work in the US?
4057,"'even' if it has better features, it'll still just be an Apple watch knockoff"
4058,He didn't talk about the battery or did I miss something?
4059,These type of watches should be compared with the other Android watches. Apple watch has nothing to do with the Android world. You want an Apple watch buy an iPhone first.
4060,"Really is about time all the apple envy ended, they havent innovated anything in years, just refinement of existing tech and selling at high cost with low margins. Really nothing thats so desirable after all these years that companies and users want to emulate them so much."
4061,Boston -> moved to NYC (Brooklyn?) recently according to recent videos.
4062,"The 3100 has been quite good on Fossil's Gen 5 watches.  It took far too many generations of optimization to get to this point, but I have no complaints in my day-to-day use."
4063,When is the 4100 supposed to come out? Any word on first brand to implement it?
4064,"Perhaps that's intentional. ""Look I have an Oppo/Apple Watch!"" Apple Watch is pronounce like ""Ah-po-wah-tch"" in some places where emphasis is not places on the L sound."
4065,"> who can't afford the original/the necessary iphone 

or someone like me, i love the design and software but don't want to switch to IOS. i wish they would sell it in Canada, it looks like a good watch."
4066,"This is why so many Chinese products aimed for the Chinese and Indian markets are copycats/clones. In those places Apple is seen as a luxury product, and thus a status symbol and far harder to duplicate than designer handbags or sunglasses or watches, and you're one in a billionish, so you want to stand out. In countries like America, not only would Apple sue you if you were an American company, but nobody but extremely shallow people care what phone you have, if your handbag is designer or not, etc."
4067,Isn't that basically what he says in the first minute of the video?
4068,Yet its still better than most android smartwatches
4069,It is 2.4 times cheaper than an Apple Watch however
4070,how is it destroying the image of Android? He literally said in the review that he liked the experience more than other watches
4071,Does Android Wear / WearOS even have an image without Chinese OEMs?
4072,They've been doing that since the first iPhone.. Nothing new.
4073,"Except this is the best Android watch to come out. 

I rather have a good apple clone than an original piece of garbage"
4074,did you drop this: /s ?
4075,You don't have much choice then
4076,"To each their own, but personally I've been nothing but happy with the Fossil Explorist line over the years. wearOS is perfectly fine on a competent piece of hardware."
4077,"WearOS watches have issues, but none of the alternatives would fit my needs. Apple Watch is Apple only. Fitbit is for health and doesn't have apps. Samsung uses Tizen, which is limited. If you're happy with the default apps, it's fine, but the app store is a desert."
4078,They'll have to change the design to be able to sell in the US.
4079,41mm is up for preorder on amazon germany.... No 46mm yet tho
4080,"When this watch looks like a low budget Apple Watch, down to the hardware to the software, then it absolutely should be compared."
4081,"You could see a lot of AirPod knockoffs or Apple Watch Knockoffs if you go to mercadolibre or Amazon or EBay, you wouldn‚Äôt see Samsung gear knockoffs nor Pixelbuds knockoffs..."
4082,"> they havent innovated anything in years

And who's innovating?

> just refinement of existing tech and selling at high cost with low margins

Apple has extremely high margins.

> Really nothing thats so desirable after all these years 

Your opinion conflicts with the fact there are multiple AirPods clones on market today."
4083,"Really is anyone innovating much? The only actual innovation I see is the folding screens which are still too fragile to be mainstream. At least Apple has been refining and improving things whereas Android is largely the same mess it has been for awhile now. Hell. Many Android phones are actually axing features to the point there's less choice and more redundant glass sandwich phablets than ever before. No more 3.5mm, no reasonably sized phones, no micro SD, no removable batteries, rooting and roms are less common then ever, software support still sucks, and for some idiotic reason, we went away from the small bezels LG and Samsung gor right to ugly notches and holes.

I guess you could say we got a mostly useless excessive array of cameras, Google and Apple have repeatedly proven more isn't better and the bigger batteries are offset by more power hungry components so phones still seam to only last a day or so.

At this point, with pip on iOS allowing some form of multitasking and a rearangeable home screen, I'm having a harder and harder time justifying android when I need a new phone especially with Apple probably coming out with a 5.4in iPhone. Maybe if LG releases something small with a headphone jack but at the moment they don't seem interested in anything less than 6.8 in."
4084,"> they haven't innovated anything in years, just refinement of existing tech

Make changes (i.e. refinement) in something established (i.e. existing tech)."
4085,My fossil gen 5 was terrible. Probably the smoothest by far but battery life was horrible.
4086,"That's the 1gb of ram, not the processing capabilities of the SOC.  The 3100 isn't significantly different from the sd400 that was on the first Android Wear watches except they get all 4 cores enabled since power consumption improved slightly with the 3100.

Regardless, it's still not nearly as responsive and consistently responsive as Samsung's watches.  The exynos SOC in their Wearables (maybe in combination with software/firmware customizations) provides a much better performance experience compared to wear3100/WearOS watches, especially over time.  I know this comes off as possible elitest, but the only reason you perceive the fossil (or any Android watch) as fast is because you've only used Android watches.  They are not a good performance experience."
4087,">or someone like me, i love the design and software but don't want to switch to IOS. 

That was the whole pitch of miui in 2010. Tbh r/android is sometimes pretty hard unnecessarily on funky mixes b/w oses."
4088,Watch oneplus release it as the oneplus watch.
4089,"Exactly to need an iphone to buy an apple and get the ecosystem benefits, now at least we have a choice in the android world."
4090,Dude probably didn't watch it.
4091,And also why it's in quotes.
4092,That‚Äôs not saying much
4093,You can get a new S3 for cheaper than this. And the Apple Watch is more than 2x better than this. So it‚Äôs worth it.
4094,It makes it look like we're too poor for real Apple Watches so we have to settle for an interior rip-off
4095,Samsung isn't Chinese.
4096,"Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit"
4097,My wife has one and the battery is just atrocious. My galaxy watch lasts 4 days on charge with about 40 mins of gps tracked walks daily.
4098,"Also comparing a smart watch without comparing it to the best and most well-known product in the category seems to be the wearable equivalent of sticking your head in the sand. 

Oppo looks to have done an excellent job here for half the price of Apple's offering."
4099,"Well, comparisons are useful if we have options to buy any of them. We all know Apple is another level. So,

To the hardware maybe
To the software not at all"
4100,"It's really kinda pathetic that people deny Apple is killing it and that other companies DO want to be like them, Android phone owners DO want a phone like theirs etc. It's written all over the market."
4101,"I'm surprised.  The Gen 5 has been great for me.  With AoD on and a mix of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and using the assistant 3x a day, it works from 9 AM until 2 AM consistently."
4102,Had to change hella settings and disable some apps for the battery to last me nearly all day with average use.
4103,"The battery life is just sad. A day, maybe, if you don't look at it. And the bloatware on it slowing it down. 

I bought one used so I'm just glad i didn't pay full price for it. 

Nothing will be loved as much as my Pebble Time."
4104,/r/android sometimes sucks apples dick a little too hard... give android credit where credits due.
4105,"And the choices in the ""Android world"" still fall up short when compared to Apple Watch. 

Apple is running away with the wearables market, much like they did in other markets (MP3 players and tablets) because they're not creating cheap ""me-too"" products."
4106,"It's a start. AW has always been a half baked piece of shit. Google will never ever do anything meaningful with it, it will honestly come down to manufacturing partners making their own steps forward while dodging GPM restrictions."
4107,Sad but true
4108,Insecure much?
4109,bruh who cares what people think. while personally I wouldn't wear it for similar reasons that's just due to my personal gripes and nobody elses
4110,Who hurt you? LMAO
4111,"You can downvote all you want, but that's exactly the perception that people get from these apple look-alike products. And that has plagued android's image from the start, even though android manufacturers are the ones tha innovate and apple also has copied android a bunch"
4112,This has to be bait
4113,"When I was in Hong Kong in 2009, I've seen a bunch of Samsung devices that looked like a iPhone I'm electronic shops. That was the time period where Chinese and Korean brands were naming everything stating with ""I""."
4114,And all three of those choices are better
4115,"Excellent job copying and pasting Apple‚Äôs homework.

Nice it took Oppo 5 years to do so, though."
4116,"> the software not at all
You might want to get your eyes checked. Control Center rip-off, call screen rip-off, Breathe app animation rip-off, the Health app rip-off.

It's embarrassing and pathetic. I feel sad for those chasing a copycat product that's inferior."
4117,Yes. There are many great things about Android but Apple is leading in both mobile silicon and ecosystem. Android OEMs should aspire to have things too.
4118,Fossil Gen 5 was lag hell for me after trying it after Apple watch. Night and day...
4119,"Same, I got it for $80 brand new at the beginning of the year. It was nice but honeymoon period didn't last long."
4120,Just wait till Apple comes out with Apple Glass this fall... Apple is going to be a decade ahead in the wearable world with no one even coming close.
4121,"I don't know for you but i am not willing to buy an iPhone just for the apple watch, samsung watches are good too and i'd prefer having choice even if it's a knock off because at the end of the day it's up to me to choose whether i buy it or not."
4122,The Apple Watch is far from a ‚Äúhalf baked piece of shit‚Äù lol.
4123,lmao it's a fucking watch so what if it's square like apple's
4124,Even the Withings hybrid watch works better than most WearOS watches lol
4125,Not very innovative but it quickly jumps to the top of the pile for WearOS
4126,I'm also saying the same. The whole software on this watch is just pathetic.
4127,"Yeah I tried everything but the fossil was in battery saving mode majority of the time. A good portion of that was user error because of daily charging. Impossible to track sleeping and heart rate overnight. 

Coming from Huawei gt watches, spoiled me with battery life. I could accept the lack of features because it always worked. 

Now I'm using the Samsung watch 46mm and it's the perfect mix between the 2. Everything works and battery life is great."
4128,"I don‚Äôt think Glass will be ready till next year.

And casual users will probably need to wait till the 2nd generation before it‚Äôs worth it."
4129,"That's awesome! Your comment doesn't dispute anything I said, though."
4130,By ‚ÄòAW‚Äô I think they meant Android Wear
4131,I am referring to Android Wear.
4132,Exactly. Not like there are no square watches in the market. I had a fastrack watch(simple) with a rectangular watch face in 2010.
4133,Leaks say that it‚Äôs going to be Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúone more thing...‚Äù at their October event this year with a launch in Q1 2021.
4134,Probably. I thought it was always referenced as WearOS?
4135,Android Wear is the old name
4136,2021: Android Wear Messenger.
4137,"> Also new in watchOS 7 is a long-requested sleep tracking feature. Unfortunately it‚Äôs pretty useless. While the watch has some awareness of how long you were in bed and unconscious, there‚Äôs no data on the quality of your slumber -- nothing on how much deep, dreamy sleep you got versus a light doze.

Note that third party sleep tracking apps are great. I‚Äôve been using autosleep for years and it massively improved my sleep, which has made a huge difference in my daily energy. 

These have always worked on apple watch, but if you never tried sleep tracking before: give a third party app a try."
4138,I was shopping for and reviewing both SE and S6. I‚Äôm considering going for series 6. My question would be regarding cellular. How would that work? I have Verizon so do I pay extra a month or does that connect to my phone so I can be away from my phone to use it? (Thank you in advance).
4139,"""The always-on display is also two and a half times brighter: 500 nits, up from 200 on last year‚Äôs model. ""

What a weird bit of false reporting. Series 6/SE/5/4/3, they're all 1,000 nits. https://support.apple.com/specs/applewatch

Apple's claimed ""up to 2.5x brighter in direct sunlight"" seems to be an improvement in the software stack or the ambient light sensor at best. Haven't seen any reviewer actually document it happening though."
4140,"I tried using sleep tracking apps, but never felt they helped me sleep better. what did you do to make them helpful?"
4141,"Apple isn't showing the extra info because they did the research and weren't happy with the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the data. Other apps make so many assumptions on so little data. Good for casual use, but by no means as accurate as many people think."
4142,Autosleep is the sole reason I recognized that I have sleep apnea. Tremendous fan of that app.
4143,Would autosleep work well with the Apple Watch SE?
4144,I‚Äôm pretty sure both Apple and Engadget are referring to the brightness when the screen isn‚Äôt activated. So the ‚Äúalways on‚Äù (when it‚Äôs dimmed and you aren‚Äôt using it) brightness of the 5 is 200 nits but the 6 is 500. There are photos of how much brighter it is in the sunlight.
4145,"**always-on**, not the whole display itself."
4146,Are you just intentionally ignoring the part where they‚Äôre talking about the always on display?
4147,"They‚Äôre actually correct, you are wrong. The always on display can now be up to 500 nits. All the displays (NOT THE AOD) go up to 1000 nits...... they‚Äôre specifically talking about the AOD, not displays in general.."
4148,Isn‚Äôt there an improvement for screen and chip efficiencies too?
4149,"Also curious about this answer; typically it‚Äôs ‚Äúoh neat, look at my sleep cycle‚Äù and ‚Äúman looks like I didn‚Äôt get a ton of deep sleep last night‚Äù but while interesting to look at I‚Äôve never felt like I could actually do anything about what‚Äôs happening while I‚Äôm asleep."
4150,"/u/swimbrief, adding you too. So, I think it depends on the issues you had. For me, I had bad sleep for years. Hard to fall asleep, easy to wake up in the morning. Sleep tracking let me try different things and measure whether they worked. 

There were some other benefits too. The tracking sums up your average sleep over a week. If I felt a bit tired but my average was good, prob didn‚Äôt need to plan on a nap. If I felt tired and average was bad, probably did. 

I could also see how different foods affected my sleeping heart rate and deep sleep. I figured out certain food triggers and eliminated them. (I often felt worse with these foods, but sometimes I also wake up tired without them. So having the numbers let me make better decisions). 

The waking hrv feature of autosleep is also useful. I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a decent indicator of how hard I can push myself in a workout on a given day. 

If you fall asleep whenever you want and sleep like a baby, there‚Äôs no need for tracking. But if you have any sleep issues it‚Äôs super helpful. 

Stuff that worked:

* Eating earlier in the day: both breakfast + final meal
* blackout blinds
* low dose melatonin
* More consistency in bedtime + making bedtime sooner"
4151,"For me personally, it just made me realize how little sleep I was getting. I was getting under 4 hours a night. It‚Äôs nice that the Apple watch is consistent and reliable. So it‚Äôs helped me keep myself accountable."
4152,">Apple isn't showing the extra info because they did the research and weren't happy with the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the data. Other apps make so many assumptions on so little data. Good for casual use, but by no means as accurate as many people think.

Yep there is no way a wearable is gonna be able to accurately record different sleep states."
4153,"Oh wow. What were the signs you saw in autosleep?

The new blood o2 readings will prob be a big boost for stuff like that in autosleep."
4154,"Yup! S6 didn‚Äôt really add any sleep capability that I know of other than the O2 sensor.

So any watch will do. The battery on my S4 is fine for sleep tracking, I just charge it when showering."
4155,Exactly. I don‚Äôt know what this guys is going on about. The AOD on the S6 is 2.5 times brighter.
4156,"Apple stated it's up to 2.5x brighter in AOD mode in direct sunlight.

Engadget used no such qualifiers. It's false reporting.

Also, haven't seen anyone convincingly document this supposed difference. If you come across one please do share. Every review I've seen, there's no discernible difference."
4157,"""The always-on display "" is what they wrote. That is the whole display itself. 

They also ignored the other qualifiers Apple used: **up to** 2.5x brighter in **AOD mode**, in **direct sunlight**

It's false reporting."
4158,"The display is called ""the always on display"" that is different than referring to the ""always on"" mode of the display.

Are you just intentionally ignoring where Apple clearly qualified **up to** 2.5x brighter in **AOD mode** in **direct sunlight**, and this website threw out all those qualifiers and false reported."
4159,Where are you getting these numbers? I haven't seen it published by Apple anywhere.
4160,"Yes, the better chipset allows for higher output on the AOD as well as performance gains."
4161,"Series 6 has same screen as the Series 5, with the pressure sensing gasket removed."
4162,That was basically the crux of it for me: I know if I slept well or poorly without the aid of a sleep tracker.
4163,"Interesting, thanks for the tag and the rundown! I suppose it makes sense that if someone has sleep issues the tracker can help test things and isolate problem-causers.

For me, I feel I just need to get more sleep, so the sleep tracker app seems to do the trick whether or not I wear the watch while I sleep."
4164,Periods of wakefulness up to 10-15 minutes occurring multiple times every night that I had no recollection of. Turns out those are what apnea episodes look like.
4165,"At this point, I‚Äôm not sure what you are trying to accomplish. There‚Äôs an obvious difference, I‚Äôll include a photo from a forum over at Macrumors.

4166,"If that‚Äôs how you interpreted it, you‚Äôre entitled to that opinion. I can see what you‚Äôre saying, as the wording can be a bit weird."
4167,[deleted]
4168,"You seem to be intentionally conflating the AOD (Always On Display) & the actual screen output (NOT always on display). Yes, ever since the Series 3 watch, max brightness is about 1,000 nits. Apple doesn‚Äôt specify the exact percentage or nits the AOD can drop too. Why?  The AOD brightness is dynamic and isn‚Äôt ‚Äústuck‚Äù or set to a particular percentage, however, the average brightness for AOD was about 200 nits. Now, under direct sunlight or other bright lighting situations, it can go as high at 500."
4169,It‚Äôs not the same tho. Check ifixit‚Äôs tear down
4170,"I haven‚Äôt used any myself (yet) but I think something that can automatically keep a record of sleep quality, that can inform your own decisions over time, could be valuable. I just gotta get over the hump of actually wanting to sleep with my watch on; my sleep schedule (and the consequent quality) can tend to be all over the place especially since March so it may be beneficial for me to identify trends. it‚Äôs all about what you wanna make out of the data, if you choose to do so!"
4171,"How many periods are we talking about? I have those, wondering if it‚Äôs something I should look into."
4172,Thank you. That's the first such example I've seen.
4173,"""The always on display"" is the physical display, ""AOD mode"" is the always-on mode of the display.

Linguistic ambiguity, combined with them throwing out the other qualifiers, it's false reporting."
4174,"No, Apple provided qualifiers in their statement, this article conflated the two.

Still, where did Apple state  maximum nits for AOD mode? Where are those numbers coming from?"
4175,"How very dare you say thank you!  
 - this community, apparently."
4176,"Seriously, to an extent I understand why his previous posts were downvoted but not to that level, but how is this comment getting so much hate?"

4178,Definitely the most positive I‚Äôve see him with an Apple product. 
4179,I really liked this review. Very informative and just makes me want to get it so badly!
4180,"Probably one of the most cozy and enjoyable reviews I've seen. This good doesn't scream to the camera like half of them do, he doesn't praise Apple so much it hurts and the production quality is great. And the amount of information and the way he gives it is awesome. :)"

The watch is 2mm bigger than the old one and it has rounded corners and a more subtle red dot. So it makes all the others look like complete trash compared to it. And the font size is bigger. So it‚Äôs also better. 

Like, I understand he‚Äôs better at reviewing stuff than me and I don‚Äôt have my hands on one of these yet. 

But that‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs really why it‚Äôs so much better? Just seems hyperbolic to me for no reason. 

And the text is bigger? You can make the text bigger on the old watches too. I‚Äôve never found legibility to be a problem on my S3. "

4218,Could also be that he is a big fan of matte black. The aluminum space gray is the closest Apple has to matte black for the Apple Watch. #matteblackeverything
4219,"During the video he referenced the price range of the different watch types and mentioned that ""you could spend 8-900 bucks on this thing, but I would not recommend that [scoffing]."" So I think he doesn't agree with the premium placed on SS and Herm√®s variants. "

4225,Yes. Actually there are pretty good third party apps for that. (I used AutoSleep for a while.)
4226,"No first party, but Apple did acquire the Beddit sleep tracking app."

4301,"It helps to have some appreciation for how ambitious that very first model was. It's analogous to the original iPhone: just barely being able to overcome the laws of physics to make something minimally viable. I had the original iPhone and was desperate to replace it as soon as the next model came out. I'm elated that I got 3 good years out of the S0.

This really is far less of a problem with the aluminum versions. Of course it won't matter in really static situations like riding on a nice paved road where you don't get any vibrations on your wrist or when your ride a snowboard where you have tons of clothing and gloves anyways.

4317,"I don‚Äôt wear jewelry and I told myself that I would never get the watch. However, after my boss recommended it for work and leisure, I decided to get the 6 series GPS + cellular. Have to say after a little over a month using it I‚Äôve come to love it. I put it on in the morning before going to the gym and the only time I take it off before I go to bed at night is when I take a shower. I like the Siri functionality especially with my AirPods Pro in. It also works really well when I take a walk at night time and leave my phone on the couch. I can listen to music and still answer calls, texts and emails from the watch. I do, however, wish that Apple would focus on the Home app on the watch when not connected to WiFi or connected to your phone via Bluetooth. My Home accessories don‚Äôt seem to respond over my watch‚Äôs cellular data. That‚Äôs really the only problem I‚Äôve run into so far."
4318,"I think the reality is that from outside the Apple Watch seems like really cool tech but it‚Äôs not obvious if it‚Äôs actually something you will use.  I wasn‚Äôt sure before I got it.  Turns out I use it a lot and love it.   But I can see how some people wouldn‚Äôt.  I almost forget my use case doesn‚Äôt match everyone else.  For instance ... I don‚Äôt use Siri at all, for anything and have literally never paired headphones to mine.  

Also ... I have an iPad.  I don‚Äôt use it.   At all.  Ever.  I know some people love them.  

Truth is we have a lot of overlapping tech and which pieces are most useful depends on you.   The parts of the watch that are really specific are the all day calorie/health stat tracking.  If you don‚Äôt use that given almost everyone carries a phone it‚Äôs certainly going to be a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù as to whether you love the watch."
4319,Lmao. He‚Äôs lying about the charging a hundred dollars for the sport loop. Does he think people don‚Äôt know what they cost??

4324,"The parts of the review that got me were, ‚ÄúI tried to be a watch person but it‚Äôs just not me,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI was expecting it to be more entertaining.‚Äù

You didn‚Äôt try to be a ‚Äúwatch‚Äù person, then. Watches keep time - that‚Äôs literally it. You bought what you thought was a wrist video game console. Oy."
4325,I also have an iPad that I‚Äôve barely ever used. I agree we have overlapping tech. That‚Äôs why I think it even stranger to turn to a watch for ‚Äúentertainment.‚Äù
4326,"I got the iPad mini at launch, thinking it was the size that turned me off. Nope. I like a keyboard, and multiple windows, and multi-tasking, etc. the iPad is just a Netflix movie tablet for when I travel and camp. hah"
4327,"Totally. But what‚Äôs so confusing about this to me is the expectations are just weird. It‚Äôs a one-inch screen that‚Äôs advertised primarily for health and fitness tracking, or an extension of your phone‚Äôs basic functions. Why would anyone expect it to be a consumption device?

Not finding a device useful for you, fair ‚Äònuff. I love my iPad, but I can see why it just wouldn‚Äôt fit into some people‚Äôs needs.

But you perceive a difference between whether the iPad offers anything to you in particular, and whether it‚Äôs bad at what it does offer and what it‚Äôs supposed to be. Those are two different questions.

Expecting things that just make no sense and then giving a bad review of the device for not living up to an illogical expectation is just odd."

Proper competition is necessary and great."
4336,"Reading this made me realize how frustrating it's been lately looking at the Android landscape - I am someone that would use a smartwatch, but sadly, besides the Gear Watches, there's really nothing that would be feasible to use. I enjoy Tizen, but it doesn't have Google Assistant, it lacks apps, and isn't integrated enough between the watch and phone. 

At this point Google should spin their hardware division into a separate company (or buy Essential and have them operate independently with the HTC and Pixel team). Google's values don't align well with building premium hardware and software experiences."
4337,"What Apple has done with the Apple Watch is simply inspirational to all the hardware product development teams out there.

I'm an avid watch enthusiast (you can check my submissions), and it's astonishing how a $600 Stainless Steel Apple Watch is comparable in build quality and fit/finish to Swiss pieces multiple times that price. Most people make fun of how Apple charged $400 for their stainless bracelet band, but it is widely recognized as one of the best bracelet in the entire watch world for a fraction of the cost of what the high end brands would charge.

I thought Moto 360 looked good in picture, until I saw it in person and its poor fit and finish and comical 48mm size made me realize it's a gadget for only the hardcore tech people (with a minimum wrist size requirement too), instead of an universal personal accessory that just happens to pack a lot of tech inside.

To be honest, a smartwatch is the best place to show hardware/software vertical integration, and I am not sure any companies in the world has the same culture and resource to pull something like this off.

[Here is my AW sitting next to my JLC](https://i.imgur.com/KcQaYll.jpg), it's incredible how well it holds up against watches that costs 15x as much.

EDIT: For people who are interested, you should read Jony Ive's interview [with Hodinkee](https://www.hodinkee.com/magazine/jony-ive-apple), the number 1 watch site/blog. Himself is a huge horology fan and for some reason I doubt anyone working at Wear OS understands much about horology, let alone having a Patek Philippe Nautilus as his personal favorite. 

EDIT 2: [Here is the AW on my wrist](https://imgur.com/a/ve02t) next to my first mechanical piece, a Tissot LeLocle, it's different for sure, but I dare say no other smart watch would look as good sitting next to that Tissot."
4338,"Apple Watch works because of the hardware+software integration of Apple allowing them to put very powerful chips into their watches.

I kinda wish for Android wear to be a lot stupider and almost be a Pebble-esque device focusing on being an extension of the phone rather than a new phone entirely.

I want my watch to track basic fitness, last for a week (or more), notify me and allow me to respond. MAYBE at a push serve some music over bluetooth without the need for a phone. "
4339,Wear OS is exactly what convinced me that I needed to switch to the Apple ecosystem for this first time in my life... my iPhone and Apple Watch should be delivered tomorrow.  Sad day
4340,"I'm considering switching to iOS because I want a watch and Apple Watches are the only ones that do it for me. They look nice, come in a small size, and get regular updates."
4341,"I'm hopeful for WearOS to get its shit together. I see it now as where Android was 6 or so years ago. Android was a fragmented mess. Each manufacturer was trying to differentiate itself with skins. There were few phones that had a completely excellent experience. Even Android's UX was clunky at best. Now many manufacturers have a pure or close to pure version of Android. There aren't too many weird quirks and as an industry have agreed what the general populace wants in a phone (not saying they're right. But at least they agree?). 

Apple, on the other hand, has excellent UX and UI. They created an OS that, until the iPhone X, largely remained unchanged. You had a home button that took you to the home screen and the home screen had all your apps. It was easy and intuitive and had mass appeal. At the same time, it was limiting. Now that Android has matured as an OS and overtaken iOS in UX and UI (material design, most everyone has the virtual nav bar, etc.), iOS has removed their iconic home button and replace it with gestures. 

I didn't like the design of the Apple Watch when they initially debuted it. It looked like someone shrunk an iPhone 6 to watch size and put a band on it. But in keeping their design language, they succeeded in creating something that was uniquely Apple. Something that is immediately recognizable as an Apple product, but still leaving just enough room for individualization (watch bands instead of cases). 

WearOS is fragmented now. You have too many kinds of WearOS devices, even from a hardware perspective. At minimum, you have your 9 axis MEMS sensor for activity recognition. Then optionally, you have heart rate, GPS, speaker, mic, crown, multiple buttons, cellular compatibility. It's confusing! I geek out so I can understand why some features work on some watches and not on others, but most people will just be overwhelmed. 

Google is refining WearOS. Most manufacturers are fashion brands these days, so you don't have to worry as much about software fragmentation. But that puts the onus of making WearOS successful on Google. This is when you really need a Pixel line to guide manufacturers on what it a great device looks like. I mean, arguably, the Pixel is the flagship of all Android devices. WearOS needs the same champion to be able to go toe to toe with the Apple Watch. "
4342,"Google, the new Microsoft. Those guys who said that were right"
4343,"I have been with Android for about 10 years now and a few weeks back I purchased an android watch and while it was quirky I gave it a chance. A few days ago I'm out cycling and only have my watch on and near the end of my ride I pull into a local brewery to buy a bottle of post work out beer and go up to pay with Android pay on my watch. I stand there trying to click my watch for 30seconds while it lags to open Android pay, I let a lady pay ahead of me while I frustratingly try to reset the watch. Android pay loads but it again lags out and won't work. At this point I shamefully put the beer back and tell the clerk I'll come back tomorrow after my bike ride again with a credit card (after leaving I smacked myself as I had my phone in my pocket and could have used that for android pay....but that's in hindsight). 

This was the last straw for me. I went out and purchased an iPhone X and am typing this from it now. I am patiently waiting for the iWatch and have returned my android watch.  Sad to leave android as I really love the OS but I am happy with the choice."
4344,"I think it was smart of Apple to realize the potential of focusing on personal health. It really was the best part of their conference. I have a Gear Sport, and while I still love it, it's hard not be envious of the Apple Watch. 

By reducing the bezels, it also sold me on the watch shape as well. I love round faces, but you do really get more information on Apple's watchface."
4345,"I've been going back and forth between Android and iOS, and now I'm thinking of going back to iOS. Not because I love iOS, I very much prefer the openes of Android but their are no real competitors to the Apple watch and AirPods. They work flawlessly.

I bought the Gear Sport smartwatch last year and while the watch itself is great, the ecosystem is non existent and the support for 3rd party syncing sucks. I can't use it for fitness(does not sync to fitnesspal), I can't reply to messages from 3rd party apps only sms from Samsung. It's just too limited in functionality which is a shame since it's a very good smartwatch in battery and usability.
"
4346,Oh how the narrative has changed on this DOA doomed product. 
4347,that watch 4 actually looks good with the small bezels... sigh
4348,"I really love smart watches, and this is one of the factors that pushed me to Apple. The hardware simply cannot compare."
4349,"WearOS was the ""Google"" issue where it's something they released to be reactionary to market demands but they don't really have any enthusiasm for it so it gets released then put on a backburner until it's so horribly out of date they are forced to update it. I loved my Huawei Watch hardware, but watching Google ignore major bugs for months on end and never release feature updates really put a toll on my trust in the WearOS ecosystem. 

I thought that I would hate switching to Tizen and would have to bite the restocking fee, but honestly I haven't looked back. The UI is fun and intuitive compared to the disaster that was Wear 2.0, the animations are my kind of thing (sorry Mr. Mobile), and my only complaint with the app situation is the fact that Samsung's store app is terribly organised (although I would like a Reddit app at one point). There hasn't been a single point where I have thought ""damn I wish I had WearOS right now), and that's a bad thing as Tizen isn't an "" official accessory"" to Android and it still easily keeps up with WearOS and is better in several other aspects.  

They are doing the same exact thing for Android Auto as well (this map graphics corruption bug is almost a year old now, smh)."
4350,"I don't know if I'm the only one, but I feel like Google really screwed up by delaying the new Pixel watch. They could have given the ""New WearOS"" a strong device to set an example, and gotten a ton of sales by bundling it with the launch of the 3/XL. Or at least more impulse buys with people wanting a shiny new watch to go with the new phone.

It's honestly just a very disappointing situation."
4351,"I used to think the apple watch was a really poor attempt at a smartwatch compared to devices like the Moto 360 in terms of looks and UI, but honestly at this point , I think If apple made the Apple Watch work with android I'd buy one. Wear OS just feels very boring at this point...  I'm about ready to upgrade from my original moto 360 but I don't even know what I'd buy... nothing seems interesting. "
4352,"To be fair, isn't it getting a huge make over in like a week or so? All hands on and previews seem very positive compared to current versions. I've never used an Apple watch, I'm sure they're slick like all Apple products, but I wear my Polar m600 daily for over a year and find wear os pretty neat, with a few niggles for sure! (Who the fuck thought swiping left AND right should be to change watch face?! Until the new Google fit face last week I never changed watch face in a year!)"
4353,WearOS probably gonna join Inbox and YouTube Gaming in the retirement community soon. 
4354,Got an LG G Watch and Moto 360 at Google I/O. Stopped wearing both and switched to Apple Watch to use with my work phone. Honestly this is one more of those Google got there first but released an unpolished platform that then got ditched.
4355,"I really don't get the hate. I fucking love my WearOS watch. Does everything I want it to and it's clean and simple.

I had to wear an apple watch at work (vendor-provided) and it was very nice but it still felt wrong for me."
4356,"Google and Samsung, we need you. Please, put WhereOS on the next galaxy watch and see how many people have computer bands on their wrist "
4357,"Having to charge my watch every day is still a no go for me, I'm sure the apple watch is great beyond that."
4358,"I had the pebble, loved that thing, but will admit it was gimmicky.

Then I had the Apple Watch Series 2, eh, it was alright but charging every day? Battery gets sucked down if you use it for any fitness stuff very quickly.

Looked at AW watches, like the apple watch to me it‚Äôs just gimmick.  I guess I just don‚Äôt care about checking my messages on my watch.

Now I have a Garmin Forerunner - It‚Äôs the one that works for me.  I get a good week of charge out of it even when active, it tracks my runs, bike rides, monitors my heart rate constantly 24x7,  guess I found what I really wanted the whole time.  I wanted a watch to track my fitness and activities, everything else is secondary, Garmin has this one nailed.  I can use my phone for everything else.   Apple Watch claims to do all of that, and it does, but it just sucks in comparison and the battery life does not lend itself to being too active as in any sports mode it will drain very fast.

Just my two cents.
"
4359,Probably an unconventional opinion but I seriously don't get the hype over the Apple watch. 
4360,"Honestly though. I was just sitting here wondering how well it would pair with an Android phone. Then I remembered it only uses siri, no Google Assistant. Deal breaker."
4361,Apple watch and it's watch os important triumph wear os and Tizen. I've had all 3 now and a fan of apple and Android I use both daily but now main phone my iPhone and Apple watch and use my note for business purposes and sold my gear S3. The apple watch or watchos just feels more complete imo
4362,"Not sure why there is all the love for the Apple Watch, found mine was pretty boring, when I moved over to Android last year replaced it with a Huawei Watch 2 and it does everything I need, health, notifications, Google Pay and customisation. Apps on the AW were pretty pointless just like Wear OS. Battery life on both is irrelevant to me I have to charge my phone at night so might as well charge my watch at the same time"
4363,[deleted]
4364,"Wear OS, Tablets and up to date updates, these three areas are where google need reconsideration  "
4365,"This thread is so depressing in some ways, but can't really argue with any of what's being said."
4366,"I don't understand. What do people WANT from a wear os watch? I am able to get my texts, respond to them, answer and make calls (finally after that bug got fixed), see notifications from my nest, use my assistant, control my music that is playing.  Like, what do you want? You want that to just be smoother or what?"
4367,"I don't know what everyone's problem is with WatchOS. 
Seriously I try to get it.
I mean, I use an 1st Gen Huawei Watch along side my other Watches (Mainly Swiss Military) and bought it at launch like 3+ years ago for ‚Öì of the current AW4.

It still has a 2 days battery with always on display on, opens apps quicker than last gen AW, let's me control my lights via Google Assistant, has an OLED Panel, Water-resistant, fluid UI, looks really good with probably a better screen/bezel ratio than AW4 and metal body, is up to date and so on. 

But mainly it still serves the purpose of showing me necessary Infos/ Notifications when I need it at my wrist and letting me use Apps like my Password Manager, Navigation, Musik, Tracking, One Note or Alarm clock, when I need those.

And compared to the AW the UI is way more focused on what the purpose should be, delivering notifications / extending  the phone and not replacing the phone.
So I couldn't imagine what I want more from my watch besides even more battery, the raise to speach from the AW4 and maybe NFC."
4368,"Apple watches look like shit, they need a circular design "
4369,"Thankfully we've got Tizen, love my Galaxy Watch "
4370,"I still don't see the point of smart watches but the Apple Watch appears to be a good version of one. The lack of customization on IOS is a feature, not a bug, and that will permanently keep me from iPhones. I'm also curious to see official reliability of the data that the watch spits out"
4371,"AW user since the original moto360, using my HW1 still, owned at least 3 different Android watches and I just don't get it.  There's really nothing that Apple watch offers that I find is far and above what AW offers.  I like always on display, I get two days of battery and all my notifications work, and there's good integrations with apps that I actually want to use on the watch. For me the watch is still a fashion accessory, and I'll never like square watch faces.   

Love the down votes yet no one can identify why the Apple watch is so superior"
4372,I wish that fossil watches had LTE. They look great.
4373,"I'm not a apple fan by far, but in this landscape they have their crap together. I have a 1st gen Huawei watch that is on its last leg, and wanted to upgrade to a new phone but nothing out there really entices me even the samsung watches.  I'm not fond of the square faces Apple uses but at least the tech is neat.  Curious if this means Google is really focusing on their own os now. "
4374,"Why is it that nobody can give me an actual detailed response on what makes the Apple watch Superior? There's a multitude of reasons WearOS watches are better, AOD, battery life, etc yet people seem to still have this totally oblivious idea that Apple watches have this superiority just because their marketing convinced them."
4375,"I haven't paid any attention to the new Apple watch, but I'm struggling to see what is making it so well reviewed. What sets the new watch apart from say the Gen4 fossil? 

I have the new Fossil watch and it does everything I need it to, including heart rate monitoring, android pay and Google maps navigation. 

There is a few clunky software choices, like how you select a watch face, but I've heard the upcoming wear update will change that. 

I can easily get 16 hours battery life from the watch too, which I admit could be better but. It suits my needs. 

This article doesn't really explain anything in detail, so what does the Apple watch do so much better? "
4376,"Don't worry, smart watches (Apple or Andrpis) are about as popular as the communist manifesto. There is a small and vocal fanbase but 99,99% of people couldn't care less...we all know they simply don't work well enough in real life (1-2 day battery? Crap) "
4377,"Am I the only one thinking that the Apple Watch 4 also sucks? I mean, it still sucks, a bit less that WearOS ones, but still sucks."
4378,Fuck. This is what I'm calling it from now on.
4379,is this loss?
4380,This isn't a competition but a clear massacre.  Qualcomm holds back whereos with their shit hardware. We need competition for Qualcomm before competing in the smartwatch market with Apple.
4381,"They could‚Äôve easily capitalized on the confused  mess that was the original Apple Watch.
Why they didn‚Äôt is still a mystery to me."
4382,"The wearable space for Android, yes. Not the Apple watches, those things are great."
4383,"I was just wondering what I was going to replace my 2013 Nexus 7 with. I have no idea, there are no comparable options for the price. I'm pretty sure no tablets offer wireless charging like that did back in 2013."
4384,"They should focus HARDCORE on the HEALTH space. That's the only reason I would pay $300+ for such a device. But first it needs to get GOOD ENOUGH. It needs to track a lot of critical health factors before I will consider it, and it needs to have very high accuracy, too.

What I'd like it to track is things like: heart rate, blood pressure, glucose level, insulin level, ketone level, and ideally in the future stuff like vitamin and mineral levels and it would recommend you to eat more foods (great for advertising, too) with certain vitamins and minerals in them. 

I realize some of this stuff will require blood samples, so some medical tech that only gets the tiniest of blood samples without you even feeling it would be necessary, too. But this is what the ideal solution would look like and these smart watch companies should strive towards that."
4385,"except those spaces are where they are at because of diminishing demand, not lack of competition. most iwatch users use their watches as much as android watch users.... 5 months of diminishingly using it and its then never worn again."
4386,"Only if they had kept motorola who knows what they could have achieved, moto x at the time was very experienced focused rather than just specs galore."
4387,"This, exactly. Google wants to have their cake and eat it too. 

They want to maintain both control and ""openness"" among the Android ecosystem at the same time.

They want to offer connected, compelling experiences while being too afraid to seize on anything so vertical it that would alienate their OEMs. (Why their answer to imessage has failed so many times)

They want to offer premium hardware and software experiences while it conflicts with their interests. They've been talking a big game about battery improvements for the better part of a decade, but can never quite seem to solve the problem because they're too busy sending your data back to their servers 20 times an hour."
4388,"I wonder how much Samsung benefits from Tizen on their watch, exclusively. I bet if they released both versions, the Wear OS one would kill it in sales."
4389,"I have the Huawei Watch 2 and really enjoy it. For an android watch, it does pretty much everything you could want: google assistant, NFC payments, outlook/email responses, solid battery life (I am an average user and I can go 40+ hours without charging), FB messenger, and more.   


WearOS is just a downfall overall. "
4390,I think they should buy Essential as well.
4391,"Agree with what you say but man, I never expected to see Google and values together in the same sentence. "
4392,"Pretty much this. I've been an Android guy since the beginning (All the way from the OG Moto Droid, to the random HTC Heroes, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy Notes, Nexus 6P, and now an S8+. And I'm curious as to what it's like on the other side of the garden. maybe I'll get an iPhone to test the waters."
4393,Spot on with Tizen.
4394,"Not a big wat h person but I bought the Asus zenwatch 3 about a year ago. I now where it every day. I love the round face and I get frequent compliments on it, it not as bulky as a slot of other android watches and provides great functionality. It does not pack all the features some other smart watches do like a heart rate monitor and payment features. But I cant say I'd use them if it did. Its durable, functional and looks great, which is a lot more than I expected to get out of a watch in this price range.

https://www.asus.com/us/ZenWatch/ASUS-ZenWatch-3-WI503Q/"
4395,"Not being a watch person, my understanding is the price of a watch is pretty unconnected to the actual costs to make it, as watches are more like jewelry or other designer fashion items. A designer purse might cost double or triple in materials and manufacturing as a Target purse, but will retail for 10 or 20 times more. Is that true for watches? Do you know what the mark up is for an Apple Watch vs a designer traditional watch? If that's generally true, it's not at all surprising Apple can match build quality with much more expensive watches/bands."
4396,I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. To this day my [AW/link bracelet](https://i.imgur.com/WkzjNbQ.jpg) is one of my favorite Apple products I‚Äôve owned and to top it off Apple sent me the link bracket for free.
4397,"I think it's important to keep in mind that it's not enough to just compare dollar to dollar new, but also the value retained. A nice watch will keep most of it's value, some might even appreciate a bit, but an apple watch is at it's heart is still a piece of technology that will become outdated and eventually become worthless. 

One could buy a nice watch and keep it forever, pass it down to their kids. You would never say the same for any wearable device."
4398,"Really enjoyed this perspective. I've noticed the Apple Watch has been getting more ""respect"" from watch enthusiasts over the past year or so. Most of them wouldn't wear it regularly, but could appreciate the quality of the UX being presented, and how it feels more thoughtful than even most Apple products. Reading this, it seems this was very much Jony Ive's intention."
4399,"Yeah I had a Moto 360 from I/O‚Ä¶ the [back cracked from normal use after just a couple months‚Ä¶](https://i.imgur.com/j69xuAQ.jpg)

Apple Watch is a whole different ballgame. That being said I don‚Äôt like that it forces me to be tied into the ecosystem :("
4400,"You're absolutely right. I had a 360 as well and found it not nearly as good as hoped. It looked nice, but yeah, build quality left something to be desired. I switched to a Pebble Steel and enjoyed it *much* more. Then a Pebble Time Round, which was a fantastic casual smartwatch.

That said though, I used an Apple Watch Series 2 for about four months a couple years ago and the idea of Jony Ive being a massive watch fan and still not being able to nail the *most basic and central* part of a watch‚Äîthe time‚Äîjust feels ridiculous to me. I'm really considering a Series 4 at the moment but the fact that they still haven't managed to have an always-on screen that displays the time without flicking your wrist or tapping the screen is *maddening* to me. It's a *watch* first and foremost, excellent build construction and smart features aside. And a watch that you can't just *glance at* to tell the time is a pretty poor watch to me.

Not to be nitpicky. I agree with you on the build, construction and care Apple takes with the Apple Watch. But to me it only serves to highlight where it falls completely short still against the other luxury watches you mentioned, and even dirt cheap basic ones."
4401,I have a LeLocle too lol. I love that watch. 
4402,"What do you think about the series 4?

https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/apple-watch-series-4-review"
4403,"Not exactly related, but what do you think of the [Withings/Nokia Steel HR](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711-kzVNTLL._SL1500_.jpg)?"
4404,">I thought Moto 360 looked good in picture

Despite the flat tire?

> EDIT 2: [Here is the AW on my wrist](https://imgur.com/a/ve02t) next to my first mechanical piece, a Tissot LeLocle, it's different for sure, but I dare say no other smart watch would look as good sitting next to that Tissot.

I think you're actually visible in the reflection on the AW dial. Neat."
4405,I wish they made a round version. I‚Äôve never liked square watches unless it‚Äôs like a Casio ca-53w like I had in 4th grade. 
4406,"Apple's watch really loses me with its design. It may be a really great and high quality watch, but I just can't get past that it looks like an upscale fitness tracker. 
"
4407,"I want an AW so bad. But I don't use an iPhone as my primary device :(

If it worked with any phone I would definitely be an owner"
4408,Do you think the black screen on the apple watch holds it back in terms of appeal compared to these other watches?
4409,"Electronic jewelry, just as Steve wanted"
4410,"How do you feel about hybrid smartwatches like the [Fossil Q lineup](https://www.fossil.com/us/en/wearable-technology/smartwatches/hybrid-smartwatches.html)? 

I own one and I think they're the best of both worlds. You get to have the traditional look of a watch without a crappy screen replicating the look of an analog experience. Obviously you don't get the benefits of a screen, but you still get your sleep recorded, steps, notifications, play and stop music, etc. And best of all, you don't have to charge your battery every other day. I think I've had mine for close to a year now and I haven't needed to change the battery yet (although it was rated to last something like 6 months). For some reason r/Android never discusses hybrid smartwatches but I think a lot of people would be pretty happy if they even knew they existed. Thoughts? "
4411,"Doesn't change the fact that the Apple Watch still looks like a over polished toy, unfortunately. 

Build quality aside, square watches will always *look* inferior to round ones.

Proof: https://i.imgur.com/CQP9cQN.png"
4412,It's all opinion really. I think the AW is fugly and only beats out shit like the original G watch
4413,"I'd take round watch over a square watch any day:

https://i.imgur.com/CQP9cQN.png

Although a round Apple Watch would look sexy af if it look like this: 

https://www.wareable.com/media/images/2016/12/download-1480699182-FLSb-column-width-inline.jpeg"
4414,So you're saying the Chinese fake watches are actually better than the Swiss ones? You don't say.
4415,"Meh.

What you're saying is it's over- designed. 

I'd say most people don't really care for it to be as attractive as a $500+ watch. People are buying the Apple watch and frankly it's ugly as fuck. Square? What is this 1985?

Everything you talked about is emperor's new clothes. Because someone said it's shiny, it's popular/desirable. "
4416,"Calling the Apple Watch the future is a bit precious. 

Each and every smartwatch will be in a landfill for ages when that Tissot is still ticking. 

"
4417,That Apple watch looks really stupid next to a real watch.
4418,"If apple allowed the dam thing to work with Android phones I would purchase it without a seconds though. I refuse to purchase iPhones though, they seem so inferior to the top Android phones in terms of what I can do with my device.

Edit: Come on Apple fanboys. Not need to be bitter. I prefer a device I can tinker with. "
4419,Tldr - hey guys I have an expensive watch ! Here is the Apple watch next to my 10k watch. Ain't I cool and rich ?
4420,"Very interesting perspective, thanks. I'd have thought an actual heurologist would detest something like a smartwatch.

As someone who knows nothing about watches, I actually think the Apple Watch looks really cheap compared to your other watch, or something with a round face like the Huawei watch. It's kinda bubbly and Fisher-Price looking. I guess we are looking at watches in very different ways"
4421,"Y'know, at this point I'm going to put the blame squarely on Google. The Apple chipset is pretty good -- but it's a sub-1GHz (Apple S2 was 512 MHz) dual core processor. The WatchOS was optimized really well, though.

In the WearOS corner, we have a 1.2GHz *quad-core* processor driving a 320x320 pixel display, and it lags. There is no excuse for this. The ancient Snapdragon 400 which this is all based on drove the Nokia Lumia Windows Phones, and those ran pretty smooth on 720p+ displays. 

It should be a no-brainer to optimize WearOS given there's basically only one chipset, but instead it looks like the whole of Android is loaded on there..."
4422,Samsung watches are pretty good for that. I have the lift to wake gesture turned off and I get about 4 days of battery.
4423,That's the dream. I just want a smart watch not another phone. 
4424,This is literally a gear s3 lol wtf
4425,"I recommend you one of the Xiaomi's smartwatches. I have a Pace and it does almost everything you described.
Fitness tracking, lasts for a week, notifys you and can push music over Bluetooth over the phone. Unfortunately, there is no responding to notifications so far. "
4426,Isn't there a fitbit that does all but the music?
4427,"Same here. I haven't made the decision yet, but with android phones losing more features that made it better than Apple and Apple catching up in features it's not such a simple choice for android anymore.

Plus the better performance and knowing I'll get updates for years is nice too.. "
4428,Me too! Just switched from my Pixel 2 to an iPhone XS. Im a bit sad apparently the camera isn't as good as the Pixel 2's but I'm sure it will still be great. Apple Watch comes tomorrow!
4429,"Also feeling the same if I'm honest. Google has really dropped the ball this year making people wait for the new watch...

Which phone did you get? "
4430,"I see you have a Pixel 2XL. That's my phone right now. I love it! However, my phone and watch will be here tomorrow as well. I've been with Android now for five years. I've had over 8 phones. I just wanted to switch it up. However, are you a tad worried about the cameras? This camera on this phone is unparalleled. I'm nervous about all the different things from Apple. However, I'm excited to go back after all these years and see what's different."
4431,Im actually doing the same. Ordered the iPhone two days ago and picking up the apple watch tomorrow.
4432,You and me both. That watch and long support and customer service pushed me over.
4433,Bitter sweet would be the better way to put it.
4434,"I love my gear, it does have it's fair share of problems. 

AW is enough for me to switch to Apple."
4435,I'm considering it but I hate the Apple wall.
4436,"Considering the same, but I would rather do a payment plan (iPhone Upgrade Program for the XS 256gb and probably the AW4 through a carrier).   
I am currently on Project Fi so the actual switch will be easy, just I need to be on one of the 4 major carriers in order to do the Upgrade Program."
4437,What does the Apple Watch has what let's say a Skagen Falster 2 doesn't?
4438,Why? The Galaxy watches are just as good (if. Or better) than the Apple Watch. 
4439,[deleted]
4440,"Not sure what features you're looking for, but Fitbit's Versa is at least comparable in size and appearance. Nowhere near the apps/functionality - but for me, I just want reliable notifications and decent battery life."
4441,imo wear watches & Samsung watches looks nicer 
4442,"> Google is refining WearOS.

Yeah, it will be good. Any year now... /s"
4443,"How do you like your iPhoneX so far?
"
4444,Troy and abid(8740) in the morning!
4445,Lol I love my AirPods on my og pixel xl
4446,"hardware is hard, and Google knows it now."
4447,"I got an m600 as well! I love it. Its not as silky smooth processor wise, but it's pretty damn nice, specially for tracking rides, climbs, and runs. Love it. I did like my LG watch that I had previously as well (till it stopped charging). 

It does frustrate me that there has been a long time since chip releases, but there hasn't been enough demand on the android side from what I can see. People won't give it a try and hence, there's no one willing to buy the watches."
4448,"Not a huge makeover, just moving things around. Wear OS sucks balls"
4449,You forgot Google Play Music. 
4450,Realistically it‚Äôll last you two days.  What‚Äôs wrong with charging it overnight?  In fact i normally just charge mine when I‚Äôm in the shower each day and that gives me more than enough power
4451,They charge fast enough you can simply throw it on the charger while you shower and brush your teeth and keep it going for quite a while.
4452,I charge mine every 3 days 
4453,My Series 1 AW easily lasts me through one day and into the next. 
4454,"You don't need to anymore. I don't believe they last as long as the Samsung watches do but some of my friends report that they've lasted 2-3 days on a single charge using GPS, fitness, etc. "
4455,Thanks for this.  I am realizing that I don't want a phone on my wrist.  I want a watch that also is a fitness/sleep tracker.  I don't care about apps or reading texts and emails or paying for shit on my damn wrist.
4456,"Yeah, the only watch product of the largest watch company in the world is just gimmick. Very convincing argument."
4457,It‚Äôs something straight out of a 1980s future gadgets magazine. What‚Äôs not to like?
4458,"Seriously. I'm not getting all these people saying it's gorgeous, and yet 90% of this sub is acting like it's an objective fact"
4459,I don't get the hype over smart watches.. one more thing to make sure to charge and worry about breaking/losing.
4460,Did you write that comment on your watch?
4461,No Tizen OS
4462,"I have a 42mm galaxy watch with LTE and I get two days of battery life. My big complaint was how big and bulky android/galaxy watches were and I think the 42 solves that issue for me. It tracks fitness, gives me notifications and let's me do quick responses to messages. Raising the watch to do Bixby commands works better then I tho ught it would and I refuse to use it on my Note 8. People complain about lack of apps but for me the watch does eveything I want a smart watch to do while looking nice. I'd recommend it."
4463,finally someone who says it. All these people claiming it looks better than recent WearOS watches are insane. it's a chunky rectangle.
4464,"This is exactly how I feel. I love my 2nd gen Moto 360 for those same reasons. Plus, for a fashion accessory you just get much more variety and choices. I'm really surprised by the comments here..."
4465,"\> yet people seem to still have this totally oblivious idea that Apple watches have this superiority just because their marketing convinced them.

&#x200B;

Doesn‚Äôt sound like you want an actual list of reasons why and that you have already accepted the answer you want. So excuse us while we not waste the time."
4466,"  

This is just my perspective but here we go‚Ä¶. 

I've had a lot of smartwatches and the Apple Watch is the one that comes with least compromises in things that I care about in a smartwatch, which in no particular order (numbers are for later) are -

1 - Responsiveness

2 - Fitness / Activity Tracking that is comparible to a dedicated tracker with the ability to connect to an external HRM.

3 - Ease of keeping it charged (4+ days battery life OR fast enough charge times to keep it going indefinitely by charging while I shower)

4 - Looks (appreciate that this is subjective).

5 - Ease of switching straps (something I want to do 2+ times a day - leather for day to day use and silicone for sports & sleep)

6 - Comfortable enough wear in bed

7 - App ecosystem

8 - Not a buggy mess

9 - Always on display

The Wear OS watches I've tried fail at 1,2,5 and 6.

The Tizen watches I've tried fail at 2,3,5,6 and 7.

The Fitbit watches I've tried fail at 1,2,4,5,7, 8 and 9.

Apple Watch S3 only fails at 9 and even that I struggle to get excited about because it has the most responsive tilt / raise to wake functionality of the lot.

If only it would connect to my Android phone‚Ä¶"
4467,Look up MKBHD'S Apple watch 4 review.
4468,"Apple sold 3.7 million Apple Watches just in the first quarter of this year, making it the best selling watch in the world, smart or not. There is not vocal fan base, only apsolute market dominance.


It than sold 4.7 million the the next quarter."
4469,LOL! Don‚Äôt know where you live but both airpods and Apple Watch are super popular here 
4470,"Almost everyone I interact with has an Apple Watch these days, no joke. They are insanely popular now."
4471,Comparing smartwatches to political ideologies? REALLY???
4472,Pretty sure it has sold over 20 million since it released.
4473,"It‚Äôs not about what you think. It‚Äôs about what the general consumer thinks. Apple Watch has been selling like a hot cake since g3, and Apple now has become The largest watch company in the world right. That‚Äôs pretty telling.

And no! Apple couldn‚Äôt sell a stone like hot cake. There‚Äôs plenty Apple products with underwhelming sale number such as the recent HomePod. "
4474,Smae
4475,"I think the challenge for other manufactures is the chip. Apple is able to put an amazing chip on such a small device while still maintaining excellent battery life.

"
4476,"> confused mess that was the original Apple Watch

What exactly was confusing about it?"
4477,Apple makes such a great watch and AW4 is going to be a beast with the health feature. 
4478,">The wearable space for Android, yes. Not the Apple watches, those things are great.

Everything vs. iPod, Everything vs. iPad, and Everything vs. Apple Watch

"
4479,"I had this same thought back in 2015 whey my Nexus 7 stopped booting, and ended up... replacing the motherboard and keeping it going. Still use it every day. Only options I can think of are Huawei Mediapad (no thanks on that skin) or the also dated NVidia Shield. Everything else is too big or has a ""budget"" (read: low-res) display. "
4480,"I bought a Xiaomi Mi Band 3. It does heart rate, pedometer, and sleep tracking accurately while also giving notifications and ... being a watch. The battery last more than a week. All for $30. I can't see paying 10x as much unless it has some serious functionality while looking slick as hell."
4481,"Please cite your sources.

Meanwhile, Apple Watch sales are explosive. Check an earnings report (‚Äúother products‚Äù) and correlating commentary sometime. Also, customer satisfaction is well into the very high 90s.

Lastly, iPod was industry leading and iPad has remained industry leading for almost a decade, so I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre talking about diminishing demand‚Äîespecially since iPad growth stabilized last year and has grown single digits since then."
4482,That's funny. I've been wearing mine for 4 years now.

4484,Have you really not noticed the massive battery life improvements in Android? It's night and day compared to 5-ish years ago. My phones back then would randomly turn into pocket heaters and drain the battery.
4485,Wear OS would kill the battery
4486,Doubt it. All the Samsung watches are still gigantic needing a decent sized wrist to sit on. The form factor alienates almost all of the female population and some of the males (including myself). They just aren‚Äôt sleek enough for prime time no matter the OS.
4487,Samsung want to establish bixby not Google Assistant. It's not gonna happen.
4488,WearOS is a poorly optimized OS on top of a poorly optimized SOC that gives a piss fucking poor experience to the user. 
4489,This is what Gear watches have been doing for years though.
4490,They basically did. Most of the lead engineers are now working at google.
4491,"I was in the same boat and then I got an Apple Watch. That meant I needed an iPhone. This was fairly recent, March of this year. I haven‚Äôt looked back. I miss a few things from my Note or Nexus days (even got an Essential), but overall its a smooth experience. The Apple Watch is real slick. I can leave my house with only my watch and AirPods. Those two devices enable me to take calls, answers texts, listen to music, etc. It is great not having to carry a smartphone everywhere. "
4492,I'm getting the same feeling. I've had an iPad mini 4 for a few years and it blows away any Android tablet I ever had. I just dunno about iPhone. No download folder?
4493,"Give It a try. Nice thing is, if you end up hating iOS, you can always sell the phone (Resale price is really high on iPhones) and you won't have a huge loss. "
4494,And yet it still doesn't even touch an Apple Watch. 
4495,">Is that true for watches? 

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. For ""fashion"" brands such as Invicta, Fossil, MVMT, Daniel Wellington etc then absolutely, you can get something from China for 1/10th the price and they will look just as good.

For actual mechanical pieces and haute horology brands, the markup are still there, but the % becomes much, much less. The attention to detail in manufacturing/assembly makes them very difficult to produce in large quantities, thus driving up the cost. 

This is the [back of an A Lange&Sohne 1815 perpetual calendar](https://www.watchfreeks.com/members/27139-tvdinner-albums-other-picture61738-lange-sohne-1815-rattrapante-perpetual-calendar.jpg), everything you see there is hand finished, hand carved, and hand assembled over hundreds of hours by someone who trained his entire life in the art. And that's why people pay $100k for a piece like that.

Obviously Apple Watch isn't comparable to real haute horology, but as far as detail goes, the Stainless Steel AW had high polish, curved SS case, ceramic back, curved sapphire glass dial, even details like the [digital crown](http://cdn.iphonehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-2.13.48-PM-1024x572.png) are immaculately finished (see how the digital crown is polished stainless steel with [knurling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knurling) applied), and in my opinion absolutely comparable to a mid-tier brand such as Omega or Rolex.

TL;DR: It's all about the details, for 20% last bit extra polish/quality you used to have to pay 5x the price, and Apple get there at a much lower cost.  

EDIT: For people who are interested in this topic or are looking for personal recommendations, /r/watches is a fantastic place to start :)"

That's the whole point of horology, you can get more functionality from a Casio, but why do people still buy Rolex?

>Square? What is this 1985?

You obviously don't know much about design if you think circular automatically means good.

[This is](http://www.morganjewellers.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/5/7/5711-1a-patek-philippe-nautilus-blue.jpg) the most desirable stainless steel watch in the world. If you are lucky you can get it for $30k retail, after a 5 years long waitlist, otherwise you can buy it used for $50-70k. I guess being 1985 isn't that bad after all huh.

4509,"I neither disagree nor agree with what you're saying, except for the implication that a square screen is bad on a wearable. It's more suited for electronic displays (until someone comes up with something for round screens, *if* that happens). Preferring round over square in wearables is limiting potential future design to past design. That said, I have a galaxy watch with a round screen. "

4512,Jeez. Someone‚Äôs bitter. 
4513,"I have an Apple Watch S1 and when I turn off the lift to wake gesture I realized that I literally never use my watch.

My ideal watch would last me a day with an always on display, lift to wake, fitness trackers, and the ability to view and reply to messages.

Why is that so much to ask for?"
4514,I think they look rather childish and lack the battery life.
4515,Fitbit Versa comes close and can store music from Pandora (but not Spotify).
4516,Yup same here. I'm at a point in my life were performance and updates are my main priority. I need a tool that I know would not fail me. I can live without customization and trouble shooting. I've always used android but my next device is definitely apple. 
4517,"I'm not militantly pro or anti Apple but the fact the 5s got iOS 12 and made it faster and usable is fucking nuts. God only knows how long the X and Xs will get support with the great internal specs they have 8 years? More? I can expect what Android 10, 11, maybe 12 if I stick with the Pixel 2 XL that long. At least if I didn't have bad burn in."
4518,Yeah... 5 years of updates sounds absolutely bananas... 
4519,"As much as I'm angry with Google. I still wish I didn't have an iPhone for work. So many little things that should work just don't. For instance I can't use a swipe capable keyboard from the lockscreen when replying to texts, it forces Apple's keyboard (if there is an option to change this I can't find it). I've never had Android force me to use a different keyboard, and little things like that are rife inside the ecosystem.  Forced to use safari from the system search. Now that iOS12 is out I can just now use google maps on carplay, and I haven't gotten to try it yet. 

And as far as speed goes? I don't notice an increase anywhere. I wait constantly for my iPhone to catch up. It also seems to have random crashes that haven't been fixed in multie updates. 

I don't know why people laud iOS, i legitimately never notice anything that is actually better about it as a daily use device. "
4520,"The camera will still be great, plus you‚Äôll be getting the telephoto lens and 4K60 video recording.

If you really miss the Pixel 2‚Äôs photo aesthetic and don‚Äôt want to use something like Lightroom, photo editing within the default Photos app is extremely simple. Turning up the black-point slider, slightly increasing the saturation and lowering the colour temperature will give you a more ‚ÄúPixel 2‚Äù looking photo."
4521,From what I‚Äôve heard with some photographer friends pixel does very good in some conditions and poorly on a few (shadows /saturation etc). iPhones seem to take very balanced photos (of course these were their words - I‚Äôm not much of a photographer- they all look pretty similar to my untrained eye)
4522,"> dropped the ball this year making people wait for the new watch

Dropped the ball everywhere. This is an android forum and we are almost all agreeing that Google is falling behind. Hype for the Pixel 3 is almost non-existent. I have been a fan for years, but Apple is really starting to win me over. They are now about tied in phones, but winning by miles in watches and tablets.

I feel as if Google no longer cares about Android. The Google ecosystem is just as good on an iPhone and in some ways better. 

Samsung is the only thing keeping Android alive right now. They have done far more for the platform than Google lately. The Samsung Note 9 may still be good enough to keep me from getting an iPhone, but its becoming harder and harder to stay with Android. "
4523,"The Pixel 2's camera is amazing, no doubt, but iPhone camera's are number 2 overall, so far this year, and even number 1 in some specific cases. You'll love an iPhone camera, don't worry about it :)"

Sometimes, the earphones are connected to the phone but dont play music! Need to put them back in the case then out again and cross fingers. Its ridiculous that Apple accessories work better than native android one.

These are my experiences and opinions, not everyone uses the technology like I do and I don‚Äôt expect everyone to feel the same.  Apple sells a ton of them so many people don‚Äôt feel like me and that‚Äôs ok."

Please, be the one person who finally responds with substance if you think I'm wrong here, I would be ecstatic. Considering you responded with a vague sarcastic reply instead of actually providing reasons just like everyone else I don't really have much hope..."
4546,"~~I'm a little confused here, the Apple watch does not have an always on display? Not sure what you are referring to. Tizen and Wear OS definitely do have this.~~ nevermind read this wrong

4 day battery life? Apple doesn't even advertise a single day battery life, the new Apple watch is advertised at 18 hours. As far as charging speed there are plenty of Wear OS watches that can fast charge to full in as little as 30 minutes and actually last a hell of a lot longer than 18 hours.

I completely disagree on looks, I can almost gauruntee if HTC for example had been making the same dated square design for a watch every year people would be laughing at them and it would sell like a turd. Similarly if Apple was making some of the beautiful circular designs the fashion watch brands that's have been doing this for decades are making such as fossil, people would clamoring for WearOS watches to match the same beautiful circular design they have.

You just pull the pin on most wear os watches and you can swap the band. Finding one that is comfortable to sleep in is simple when you have a universal band, you have tens of thousands of choices for bands that have been made over the last decade, saying Apple has already made a better one after doing it for just this long is kind of baffling to hear.

What part of health fitness is better besides using a dedicated hrm, which I really can't see as a watch defining feature that would drastically change sales. Be specific.

How is the ecosystem better, be specific.

Tilt responsiveness is really hit or miss depending on the wear os watches you try, there are some that are comparable."
4547,[deleted]
4548,I thought apples watch had like a 22 hour battery life.
4549,"I think Series 0 was a bit of a mess because the software wasn‚Äôt very useful. Moreover Apple themselves seemed unsure about the focus of the watch. They spent 18 months to refresh it and during which they realised that fitness is at the core for most watch owners so directed their focus there. Since then the watch has been updated on a yearly cycle with fitness features getting the lions share of updates. 

Remember how previously Apple made big deal about being able to send heartbeats, write messages, answer calls, digital touch etc? The latest keynote(s) almost exclusively talk about health, tracking, emergency etc. with barely any mention about other features. All promotional material place heavy emphasis on fitness too. "
4550,"I don't think it was confusing, the software was just bad. Apps took forever to load. The app collage was (and still is) a mess. No GPS. Poor battery life even with no always on display.

But the build quality was really nice."
4551,"Its biggest problem is that it was underpowered and slow in a lot of cases, and Apple wasn't quite sure how people would use it.

The new chip in the second generation (series 1 and 2, confusingly) made it faster and made the connection with the phone more solid. Some OS tweaks helped, too.   "
4552,[deleted]
4553,"Yeah I‚Äôm waiting for an explanation on this one. The software side of the Apple Watch has pretty much stayed the same, aside from the introduction of the App Store. Most of the changes it has taken is in the hardware."
4554,"The usefulness of it was questionable at first.
Didn‚Äôt have any focus."
4555,There was no coherent messaging behind the watch and even Apple themselves didn‚Äôt seem clear on what they wanted the watch to be. I think it was only by series 3 that Apple decided on marketing it as a fitness device. 
4556,"Exactly, everything is budget aka a downgrade from the 7, or crazy expensive.  Mine is still working pretty well, but when it finally shits itself I think I will probably just fix it like you did.  Plus I have been wanting to learn how to work on electronics anyway.

If google released a pixel 7 tablet with decent specs and wireless charging for around $300ish, I would be pumped and go buy one right away.  We all know that will never happen though, sigh."
4557,At a recent family gathering all the kids came inside after playing outside all day and broke out their tablets. It was like 7 little boys - each with their own Android tablet. And that's when I realized why cheap tablets dominate the market: because kids are the target demographic.
4558,"sales are not indicative of long term use, which is my point... way to gloss past it.

also 'industry leading' in the tablet market also means nothing when the tablet market overall peaked in 2014 and has been declining steadily ever since, which is why companies have all together pulled out.

>especially since iPad growth stabilized last year and has grown single digits since then.

 sales of ipads increasing marginally you say... yeah, because people late to the party of owning a tablet don't have much else to choose from anymore. the overall market is not increasing. Again, you are missing the larger picture. just because one company is doing better in a niche market doesn't mean that market overall is not decreasing."

4562,The Xperia Z3 on frpyo/kitkat to this day had the best battery life of any phone I've had. 2 to 3 days between charges.
4563,"I've used wear OS watches on the crappy 2100, with always on display enabled. It lasted me more than long enough. 


Sure, battery wouldn't be as good. But it would actually be worth using, which is a good trade-off. I'm sure Apple says the same thing about always on display when people ask why they don't allow it. Cut my battery life in half, I don't care, just give me the damn option."
4564,With a new processor I'm sure it could still two days maybe more
4565,Swipe left or right to... change watch faces instead of something useful. Lmao.
4566,"Yep. Completely agree. 

The Apple Watch is the only thing tempting for me to make the switch after being an android die-hard since I got my first cell phone 13 years ago. It's a tough life right now for the Android wearable market. "
4567,"Ok? I didn't say Huawei was the first to do it. ""besides the Gear Watches, there's really nothing that would be feasible to use."" I was just giving him an alternative. "
4568,I heard you needed a Samsung phone to use Samsung apps for a lot of functionality like replying to messages and emails. It also seems to have way less options for watch faces
4569,TIL Rolex is considered a mid-tier brand. 
4570,"Exactly. Even ignore the tech inside, I can't think of a single Swiss piece that's less than $2k that has a better made case than the AW.

It's actually insane what Apple pulled off."
4571,"That's fine, but is that because watches with that good fit and finish need to sell as a luxury item, so that higher price is necessary, or because they literally cannot be made for the price Apple charges for their watch? That's the question I was asking. 

If the former, then there's nothing amazing Apple is doing, they're just selling their watch more as a functional thing than as a luxury piece of jewelry. If the latter, then it actually is something cool that Apple can do that other companies can't, even if they wanted to. The latter case could definitely be true, given how many more Apple Watches have likely sold than $20k traditional ones meaning Apple can get some savings in producing way more volume (probably)."
4572,"You just pushed me to polish mine haha. I haven‚Äôt touched up the stainless steel since the first 6 months I owned it, and it‚Äôs an OG AW. "

4586,"I made the same decision roughly 3 or 4 years ago with the 6S. Despite having a far less exciting design than my S6 Edge, the performance, stability, UI consistency, frequent updates and battery life felt like a real breath of fresh air.

If performance and updates are what **you** personally prioritise, and you have no desire for troubleshooting and customisation, then I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre making the right decision. There are other merits too, such as a general higher quality of third party apps and truly seamless integration with their other devices.

People will try say how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù but it really isn‚Äôt. All of Google‚Äôs services work fine with iOS, there‚Äôs nothing to stop you from transferring your data (there‚Äôs literally an app for it) and iOS devices work with virtually any accessory you can throw at them. Yes, there are areas in which Android is better, but if those areas aren‚Äôt applicable to you then it simply isn‚Äôt relevant."
4587,"iOS 12 is available on half of the iPhone generations that have come out so far.  That is pretty insane I think.

I switched to an iPhone 7 Plus about a year and a half ago after being a die hard Android fan and to be honest while there is not necessarily anything particularly exciting about the iPhone, it works great and the battery life (one of my biggest gripes about Android) is very consistent in comparison to Android.  I can probably count on my hands how many times my iPhone has died on me.

I keep waiting for Android to do something that will entice me but as it stands the iPhone is the best phone I have ever owned"

It's like the 5S is back to running at a good speed again. I'm really glad this has happened but honestly I'm going to end up upgrading soon because I'd like to get a newer Apple Watch but the 5S doesn't support the Series 3 (and I'm sure it won't support the Series 4 either.) It's been a good 5 year run - I'm not really complaining. But really wish iOS 12 had come out like 2 years ago.

4595,"The keyboard limitation is due to security, and it's the same reason that, wherever you're entering a password, it switches to the default keyboard. A rogue keyboard app could have a vulnerability that would allow them to steal passwords/mess with the phone. 

The keyboard thing used to annoy me, but on the latest phones it's not a problem because face ID verifies it's you when you look at the phone, meaning it's seamless. This is one of the underrated advantages of face ID: Passively verifying it's you using the phone. 

On the older phones, they are only allowed on the lockscreen once you've verified with touch ID, which is far more cumbersome. 

The frustrating decisions usually have some logic behind them, but I don't always agree with their reasoning. "

4597,"Completely and utterly agree. They are falling behind massively. The changes are good but there is so much more than that.

Samsung is making me want to stay with android for the Note series too however no watch is as good as the Apple Watch for me and that's a shame because no matter how good the Note is the AW only works with the iPhone and that's the reason I'd have to leave.

4607,Lets see what they bring in pixel 3 this year first. The full integration of hardware is bit far reach for google now.
4608,It willl soon be in the heap of Google Services that have been retired. 
4609,How about charging while in the shower and getting ready?
4610,Ins't sleep tracking on the apple watch pretty much nonexistent though? Not that much better than the apps you can get for phone? Reading most of the reviews last few days most pointed out the watch is not great for sleep tracking. 
4611,"As an Apple Watch owner, sleep tracking looks cool and all but it's not very accurate. Apple themselves don't even have a native tracking feature, and the third-party apps look cool but from what I've read aren't very accurate in terms of actual sleep quality."
4612,You don't clean your wrist under your watchband ever? That's kind of gross. 
4613,"I understand your personal experience and frustration. 

Still it‚Äôs not about who likes which product. Even mechanical watches are gimmick to a lot. It‚Äôs about is smart watch an established electronic product. 

And the answer now is yes. Apple Watch is now the single most worn watch brand in the world, which crowns Apple the largest watch maker in the world by a margin. It will always be gimmick to some people just like most consumer electronics. But it has it place and is still growing exponentially."
4614,Round is terrible for reading text. 
4615,"I don't think you understood that I was making light of your sentence construction and grammar. It's how petty people like me have fun on the internet.

If I had to guess English isn't you second language, in which case the comment is much more serviceable than whatever I could have written in your language."
4616,"Because I really look to the tech nerds of r/Android for my fashion advice. 

Lmao"
4617,Actually currently very on trend with today‚Äôs clunky fashion. 
4618,"It‚Äôs far far faster.

It will be supported for a least several years after it‚Äôs released.

And allows you to unlock your computer by just walking up to it.
Although this is kind of a moot point.

It also acts as a little remote for my Shortcuts.

This means I can play my favorite podcast without having to ask Siri or reach for my phone.
You can also get it to work with IFTTT if that‚Äôs your thing.

The health app on the phone takes advantage of it and it‚Äôs actually pretty well organized.
There is also far more of an ecosystem around it, at least when it comes down to fitness.
Also seems to pack more storage than the rest.
Which is pretty nice for podcasts and music."
4619,"AOD - I know that Apple Watch doesn't have one, I referred to it in my reply ""Apple Watch S3 only fails at 9"". I think that it should.

My S3 Apple Watch was kept going indefinitely by charging it while I showered. Regardless of what Apple advertise, 18 hours of typical use (including a workout) usually left me with about 60-70% left on the battery. It lasts much, much longer than 18 hours.
I'm aware that there are Wear OS watches that charge quickly, if you re-read my post you'll see that I didn't say that Wear OS watches fail at point 3.

The quick release mechanism on standard watchstraps is ok but but it's more fiddly than the Apple Watch straps. I'm sorry but it is. If you find that baffling I have to assume you've not used the Apple one.
Also, there is no shortage of choice for Apple Watch bands. There are hundreds on Amazon for less than ¬£15.
My comment about sleep comfort has nothing to do with the strap - it's about the size and weight of the device. The Gear S3 isn't going to be comfortable to sleep in regardless of the strap.

Connecting to an external HRM is a big feature for *me* (my post started with ""This is just my perspective""). I like to do HIIT and get my HR up to a specific rate, wrist based sensors are not good enough for this yet. None of them.
That said the HR sensor on the Apple Watch is as good as the sensor on a Fitbit or Garmin - the same can't be said for any Wear OS or Tizen watch i've tried.


Again I didn't say that the the Apple Watch ecosystem is better than the Wear OS one (re-read my post), I said it is better than Tizen and Fitbit which I think is unarguable. "
4620,[deleted]
4621,Not everything that Apple has launched has been successful. See iPhone 5c.
4622,"They undersell it for some reason. They say 18 hours of battery life, but my series 3 regularly gets over two days of use."
4623,18 hours* :P
4624,"18 hours of usage, whatever that means. Reviews have been getting around 3 days of total life"
4625,"To be fair, they only mentioned features exclusive to the new watch series. Everything else (like more complications, walkie-talkie mode and such) was mentioned at the WWDC earlier"
4626,Yea apps had to load off the phone if I recall on the original. I wouldn't say the app collage is a mess you can put it in list view if you don't like the circles. 
4627,I tried a display model and while I was impressed the app zoom out thing was weird to me. I don't understand how you're supposed to use it
4628,"Series 1 was the rebranded Series 0 with dual core (Series 0 was single core, the only difference is that S1 literally has 1 more core of the S0) released alongside the Series 2 as a cheaper option"
4629,"That‚Äôs not confusing imo. That‚Äôs a smart business move. Put a new product out there with many features, then improve and expand on those most wanted to further the reach of your product to more people. "
4630,I doubt Google had the resources to even equal the first Apple watch at the time. They clearly don't have the focus or vision considering they still have nothing 4 generations later. 
4631,So pretty much like a watch?
4632,"It was a pretty easy fix, the motherboard was like $40 on eBay. Tricky part is opening the case, I used a metal tool and it scratched a bit of the edge. And watch out for those ribbon cable clips! 
I just wish it wasn't so slow running modern apps and webpages. The OS is still pretty snappy but it does bog down with Youtube and Chrome sometimes..."
4633,"Yeah, I guess for adults the trend is to go for huge phones instead of small tablets. Really sucks for people who don't want a huge phone and want something to use in bed/on the sofa.

Even the iPad Mini hasn't been updated in years and costs *more* than the 10-inch iPad. Guess Apple also gave up..."
4634,"It did come out i bought from 02 was the best phone i had ever. Feel and finish was great, software was good. "
4635,I 2nd this
4636,You were on Android 13 years ago?
4637,"Yea just pointing out there are other watches that might look a little better, are a bit faster, have a bigger screen etc and can be cheaper that the Huawei Watch 2. I would be recommending those above the watch 2. "
4638,"Nope. Using pixel 2xl worth gear S2. All stock apps. Heard wrong. Also too there are many watches, hard to browse haha, so also misheard. "
4639,"Ok to be fair it‚Äôs the high end of mid-tier, very respected among enthusiasts and they build very high quality watches.

But they don‚Äôt innovate too much as far as [movement/complications](https://youtu.be/Zjt8sjqVwVE?t=369) go and they never go above and beyond in things like a doing a beautifully finished movement like [many other brands](https://d23x6d9cx8qezf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/patek-Nautilus-5711-Calibre-324-SC-Patek-Philippe-Nautilus-Hsitory.jpg). Rolex does some of the best tool watches and it makes sense since it‚Äôs where they started.

Case in point: [This](https://www.rolex.com/content/dam/rolexcom/watchmaking/the-making-of-a-rolex/movements/about_rolex_movement_4130_0002_840x1070.jpg) is the movement of a Rolex Daytona, it's immaculately made to the highest standard and QA but lacks superfluous finishing you see on a [more expensive JLC](http://www.ablogtowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jaeger-LeCoultre-Geophysic-True-Second-watch-11.jpg). Even a slightly cheaper Omega Seamaster has a [more decorated movement](https://d23x6d9cx8qezf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/omega-seamaster-300-master-co-axial-titanium-4.jpeg).

Real high end brands are what we call Haute Horology, which are usually marked by ornate hand finished in-house movements, [fancy/innovative complications](https://www.alange-soehne.com/assets/GalleryImage-2880x1800-px/_resampled/SetWidth1680-LANGE-ZEITWERK-MINUTE-REPEATER-MINUTENREPETITION-147-025-1.jpg) that more or less resemble miniature analog computers, and craftsman ship that is more [mechanical art](https://smhttp-ssl-39255.nexcesscdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/An-exquisite-inhouse-movement-is-far-more-revered-than-any-ebauche-movement-by-ETA-900x833.jpg) than a piece of tool/jewelry. This tier is where the holy trinity resides (PP, AP, VC)."
4640,"If you work in any industry were almost everyone is on 100k+ (finance, oil & gas etc.) they're like Casios. It's only about a weeks wages for an experienced oil & gas contractor. Kinda depressing."
4641,Rolex is only considered high end to the general public. Most of the really high end watches are virtually unknown to the average person. 
4642,"Considering the likes of Ulysse Nardin, Vacheron Constantin, and Patek Philippe can cost [10x](https://youtu.be/ubHre0yMH_c)-[100x](https://youtu.be/mTjoU5gCglU) as much, yeah, Rolex is mid-tier."
4643,"I mean it's the high end of mid tier. It's kind of like 90% of Mustang owners, they googled ""American sports car"" and that's what came up so it's what they bought. Same thing with ""luxury watch."" Very nice tool watches, expensive yes, but not on the truly luxury tier."
4644,"Now see, the issue here is that Apple doesnt make in Switzerland..."
4645,"Depends on what you consider 'better' cases. Sinn and Damasko (German companies but Swiss internals) have interesting case technology with many models sub 2k. There are tons of boutique brands doing interesting things as well, such as Farer.


Apple should be applauded for their effort, no doubt. However, believe your 2k comment is a bit of a reach."
4646,"> That's fine, but is that because watches with that good fit and finish need to sell as a luxury item, so that higher price is necessary, or because they literally cannot be made for the price Apple charges for their watch? 

I actually don't think they can, Apple can do what they do because of scale and their resources. They were able to bring some high end finishing techniques (eg. one piece curved stainless steel case with high mirror polish) to a scale that wasn't seen before, thus drastically reduce the cost.

Also it helps that the inside of an Apple Watch is electronics, which is cheap in comparison to even the cheapest mass produced Swiss movements, let alone high end in-house hand made movements. But it's still more expensive than a quartz movement, so in the end the credit is still Apple's. 

"
4647,"Apple custom designs some of the machinery used to build these watches... Their goal was to replicate the fit and finish of an artisan hand-made timepiece, yet they do it with very specialized machines and at a scale that allows them to lower cost. They save price on the movement, of course, since it's all digital inside, but make no mistake, the finishing techniques used are really hard to replicate at scale, and are much more akin to what some artisan watchmaker would use.

What they've done is nearly impossible for any other company, and the quality absolutely cannot be matched by other watchmakers for the price, because they don't have billions in cash to develop custom milling, polishing, extruding, and alloying machines.

Here's how Apple makes Aluminum, Steel, and Gold (no longer sold) watches: 
https://youtu.be/qmaYUhMH1w8"
4648,"I think I might follow your lead and polish up my original Apple Watch too tonight... my new stainless steel Series 4 arrives tomorrow, but man has my OG been a trooper. Worn it pretty much every day since launch day well over 3 years ago!"
4649,"/r/pebble there are literally dozens of us!

But yes, with my Pixel 2 a lot of the features still work just fine. Unicode character support is pretty shitty, so I don't see emojis or foreign language characters. However, since all I really want is to see the time and my notifications, it still works great!"
4650,"Ah you are right, that was the one I saw. I‚Äôll checkout the new one in person when I get a chance."
4651,"Please name some that has a curved unibody polished stainless body with ceramic back? Are there even many WearOS devices with sapphire crystal dials other than the $1700 Tag Heuer smartwatch? 

Personally I haven‚Äôt seen any WearOS watches that didn‚Äôt look like a $200 mall watch in person or an oversized Casio with big screen, but I‚Äôd love to find out about them."
4652,üòÇ
4653,I've got the 46mm Bluetooth Galaxy Watch and with always on display and the lift gesture enabled to brighten the screen I'm getting 3 days pretty consistent. If I disable the always on display I get 4+.
4654,"I've seriously thought about it, but the two main things holding me back are no notification LED (it's 2018, Apple) and no Google Voice integration."
4655,"It's Lego (Android) vs. Duplo (iOS). The bigger pieces of Duplo make it a more stable and the pieces usually fit together exactly how you'd expect, but it lacks the pieces to construct advanced or precise structures. Duplo pieces do fit Lego as well, but it's a bit half baked and doesn't feel as cohesive as using one or the other."
4656,"Pixel had so much potential. Instead, google has become another Apple wannabe."
4657,"And also the resale value is crazy when compared to Android devices.

I'm pretty sure the total cost of ownership for an iPhone Xs isn't much higher than a Pixel 3 if you factor in the resale value."
4658,iOS 12 is improving old device performance you should try it.
4659,"Higher-quality storage can slow the degradation though. Many cheap devices (or expensive ones from less reputable companies) run into problems related to flash degradation far sooner than something like the Note 9 or iPhone X would. The original Nexus 7 was notorious for having incredibly cheap storage that rendered the device essentially unusable after just a couple years, and that came out the year before the iPhone 5S did."
4660,"> It should be said though that iOS 12 on the 5s is not the same as iOS 12 on the other devices.

How so?"
4661,"You could make the same claim that iOS12 on the iPhone 8 is not that same as iOS12 on the X because of all the Animoji features. The 5S still got the rest of the features and improvements it could handle, just like the 8 got everything except the stuff that required the FaceID hardware.

In the world of Android, a Galaxy SII that was the 5S competitor at the time is probably not getting performance improvements from app updates."
4662,Funny thing is we don‚Äôt know for sure whether this is the last update for the 5S yet. It‚Äôs at least guaranteed to get all the point releases up to iOS 13. After that...anyone‚Äôs guess. By that time it will be six years old. 
4663,"That's exactly how it went for me, except my HTC M8 took a crap and that's when I got my 6p. RMA'd a few times till I ended up with my current Pixel XL that I decided to use till something better came along that I wanted or it died. I just ordered my first iPhone (Xs!) last week and it's supposed to arrive tomorrow, and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this excited for something to arrive in the mail.

I had a Moto 360 when that first came out but stopped using it after a few months due to how useless I found it. Never thought I'd be interested in a smart watch again, but now that I've switched to iOS, I'm actually quite tempted."
4664,"I assumed it was a security feature. But as the user of the phone I would like to be able to make that cost/benefit decision myself. It's especially frustrating because the keyboard just switched to Apple's keyboard while typing this comment, not even from the lock screen. 

As an aside, iOS 12 broke the hard press to open the message outside the lock screen. I can't figure out how to do this anymore, so I have to navigate to the message if I want to reply. "
4665,I just meant that an Apple Watch locks you into the Apple ecosystem since you can't use it with Android and such. That kind of idea. 
4666,You can't actually rent movies anywhere other than iTunes on iPhone. I've never had an issue buying things from other people on my Android phone. On iPhone I have to do it online as buying things through the app is impossible. 
4667,"> I'm an Android guy through and through but every time I buy a movie on Google Play, I die a little. Knowing that most other digital providers include special features with their releases while Google just gives you the movie and that's it.

Link your Google account with Movies Anywhere to get the extras."
4668,The difference is that even an iPhone can Chromecast. 
4669,Well Google is still very open compared to Apple . They don't force you to pay $750 for a 720p phone if you don't want to pay $1000
4670,"Yeah exactly, just make sure the prepaid network you go to afterwards is compatible with the phone model you bought. I‚Äôm still on my 6S that I did this with so maybe iPhones now support all networks in one device?

So definitely verify that first so you can use a prepaid carrier that works best for your needs

Also, make sure if you do this that you get a month to month post paid account with the major carrier, this way you can immediately cancel your account without breaking a contract. You may also end up owing the Big 4 carrier for about half a month of service, but that‚Äôs it‚Äôs

I did Cricket > T-mobile > Cricket"
4671,"If you haven't yet, check out r/shortcuts. As for the watch, I can not reccomend the S4 enough!"
4672,And 90% of WearOS watches have shit battery with that option
4673,[deleted]
4674,"Unless the display is some form of low power e-paper/e-ink, you cannot do always-on on a smartwatch - unless you're willing to charge the damned thing by mid-day. And... be forced into yearly upgrades because the batteries would be in deep shit after just one year of constant use."
4675,"Which Apple Watch?

This doesn't look much like a kid's watch to me:

Most Android Wear watches make the wearer look like a weeb irl.

I'd go back to a flat-tire G-SHOCK than wear an Android Wear."
4677,Maybe. YouTube music might go that route. Who knows with Google. 
4678,Dude who will track my time spend in the shower!!
4679,"Yup, 20 minute shower is generally enough to get my watch charged for me."
4680,"No built in tracking, but there are some third party apps. 

I don‚Äôt imagine built in tracking will be a thing until multi day batteries are a thing. "
4681,"I use autosleep, it's great, sucks that it's not native but it's really really good"
4682,"Apple is actually investing quite heavily into sleep tracking, just not on the Apple Watch. They bought out the company that was making Beddit 3, the bestselling standalone sleep tracker at the time and they haven't released anything new in a while. I bet you they're working on an Apple version of a sleep tracker and it's going to integrate with Health Kit."
4683,I know what you were doing. English is my first language I just don't care how I construct my sentences and my grammer online
4684,says the one worshiping a fucking rectangle
4685,"Hey thanks, I appreciate you actually giving some legitimate reasons, no joke you are the first after a good half a dozen times asking.

That said, I still disagree that making Wear OS watches faster would suddenly make them sell as well as the Apple watch, I guarantee if the Apple watch was slightly slower like wear OS watches you would hardly notice a dent in sales. What's really driving sales is their marketing, not the benchmarks for your watch.

My H watch was updated for years, still going. Not that watch updates even add that much to begin with. 

Allows you to unlock your MacBook, so a small subset of users who have one, not any PC, no? and you can set this up with a third party app as well if it's a really important feature for you.

Shortcuts are definitely in wearOS so I'm not sure what you mean.

Google fit also integrates with WearOS. Some watches have more storage than others, if that's your thing I'm sure you can find one that fits. "
4686,"So really it just boils down to you prefer the quick release on the Apple watch over the universal quick release on other smart watches and you like to use an external heart rate monitor. Correct? I can see both being important on a case by case basis, but I guess my point here is those two things can not really be argued as the reason for the Massive disparity between the sales of Apple watch and let's say some of Fossils latest gen 4 watches, that is really marketing. For the wider audience there is no massive differences that you can point to and say Wear OS is just so far behind as many seem to think, especially when you combine it with the fact that WearOS watches also have some major features such as AOD that the Apple watch is simply missing."
4687,[deleted]
4688,"Yeah I was about to say, I have a Series 1 and only have to charge my watch every other day. "
4689,"Under promise and over deliver. If you say 18 and people get 22 they're like ""wow that's awesome!"" if you say 24 they get 22 they're like ""WTF is this bullshit!"" "
4690,"Same, I could charge my Series 3 every third day if I didn't do any workout, or the every second day if I workout daily"
4691,"Really, my 4 year old LG G watch still get about 4 days of battery life."
4692,They advertise what they themselves have consistently gotten through testing and are confident that customers should get at the very least. No need to advertise 2 days of battery life if your real-world results for the average person will largely vary.
4693,Wow! A watch that last two whole days! That must be great.

I hadn't seen that Junghans before, despite living on hodinkee...that's an insanely good value. I'm keeping the Form A in mind without a doubt. Sub 1000 with a workhorse movement and an absolutely beautiful dial. Sign me up."
4705,The truly best watches are not even made in Switzerland! Omega is made in the USA and some great brands from Germany!
4706,"Interesting, I‚Äôve only heard of Sinn of the 3 brands you mentioned, and while I liked what I saw, I never saw anything too exceptional, would you mind sharing some links?

Now thinking about it, another brand that always had amazing cases is Rado, they were pioneer in a lot of the materials they use for their watches, from PVD steel to black ceramics to synthetic diamond dial, and their prices were also very reasonable at around $1.5-3k range."
4707,"I was just thinking the same thing the day of the Apple keynote, I got my watch on launch day too so I‚Äôve had it for over 1,200 days and I‚Äôve worn it for most of those days. I‚Äôve definitely gotten my money‚Äôs worth and I‚Äôll be upgrading next month. "

4713,Let's hope! 
4714,"It‚Äôs the same minus a few of the more headline features. It obviously doesn‚Äôt have any of the new Animoji stuff (I know, what a terrible shame /s) and it doesn‚Äôt support AR, but other than that it‚Äôs the same as far as I know. You still get all the same UI enhancements, API support, the notification revamp and, most importantly, the speed and performance improvements."
4715,"The S4 or S5 (depending on which way you go on the 6 months between releases) was the competitor to the 5s. 

And many improvements that happen on Android can be done apart from system changes. Instant Apps is back ported to L. Play Store Dynamic Delivery can dramatically reduce the size of apps on older devices. Many of the job scheduler improvements improve performance on older devices by dropping long running services in favor of the app compat library which is more efficient.

There is much more rolled into an iOS update so Apple must craft those such that the version is specifically made for that device. It's impressive. But a lot gets left on the cutting floor."
4716,"It‚Äôs the implication.

But even then, this little beast served me fine for longer than most of the android phones, I might go full iPhone soon."

4731,"Few counter points.
  
Speed: Yes, people do care about their watch being responsive. When my Gear S3 decides that it needs to start lagging, it sucks. I lift my arm, wait 3-4 seconds, only to see the time. You don't get that with Apple Watch. Marketing drives their initial sales. Ease of use and speed ensures repeat purchase.
  
Updates: WatchOS updates are pretty consistent and updates apply to all hardware. Only exception, WatchOS 5 does not work on original Apple Watch, which came out 3 years ago. Other series are still supported.
  
Unlocking: I use a mix of things. Macbook for dicking around, PC for doing actual work. Unlock is nice to have. Not critical if I lose it (my macbook has biometrics), but is definitely a nice thing.
  
Shortcuts: I am guessing OP is talking about Shortcuts app, which allows you to create custom Siri workflows. Not what Wear OS has.
  
Google Fit: Perhaps it changed, but last time I used it, it was a steaming turd."
4732,"No, it doesn't. Don't get me wrong here, I'm not happy about it. I really wish there was a Wear OS watch that met my needs as well as an Apple Watch because I have quite a strong preference for Android (or more specifically the Galaxy Note range of phones).

The Wear OS watch that I used (HW 2) was horribly slow at loading apps and otherwise generally quite laggy. I could mostly live with that if Android pay loaded quickly but it very often didn't and it was quicker to get my phone out of my pocket - making it functionally useless for payments.

There is an attention to detail in the Apple Watch's activity tracking that extends beyond the external HRM. It's the only smartwatch I've owned that made me take off my dedicated Garmin activity tracker.
It's the only smartwatch that tracks running distance as reliably as a Garmin Forerunner 235. Huawei, Samsung and even Fitbit can be much as 15% out on distance, Apple Watch in my experience is pretty much spot on.

Google Fit, S-Health and Huawei Health's integration with MyFitnessPal is either broken or extremely limited meaning that tracking calories in Vs calories out harder than it should be. That actually true of Apple Watch too but there's a 3rd party app that resolves it. It's not ideal but at least a solution exists.

S-Health and Huawei Health don't appear to take heart rate into consideration when estimating calories burnt in a workout. Just the type of activity and the time spent doing it which is extremely half arsed.

Apple Health estimates my VO2 Max to be about the same as my Garmin does. FitBit and Huawei Health's estimation is way off (probably because of the inaccurate GPS and HR readings), S-Health doesn't even attempt it despite having all the information it needs to do do.
S-Health up to the version that was released a few weeks ago had no way of showing me the number of calories that i'd burnt on pervious days.

I could go on...

As I say, this is just my perspective. These are things that are important to me, others may see things differently and that's fine but I don't think it's just down to marketing. 
There are almost ubiquitous complaints about Wear OS not being as good as Apple Watch in the WearOS sub, I don't think that you can write off posters there as being that influenced by Apples marketing.
"
4733,"How was the Series 0 a ""total mess""? Aside from cost and a slow processor (which at the time, was really the only smartwatch processor available), watchOS 1 wasn't much different than watchOS 5 from a functional perspective. It also sold very well. Apple learned from all of this and made the subsequent series watches that much better. "
4734,They usually include a full workout with tracking on as part of their battery life usage. I get closer to their claimed hours on my workout days esp if I'm playing music to some buds
4735,"Yeah, but I think they would be safe to say all day battery life. I've done two workouts today which is the biggest drainer, and still have 88% left."
4736,Yeah workout is the big drainer for me 
4737,"Really? The most I got out of mine was 1,5 days, and that‚Äôs without the always on display."
4738,You should strap it to your wrist :) 
4739,I mean when it comes to smart watches you'd need to a Galaxy watch or a Fitbit to get similar results. Most wear OS watches don't last two days.
4740,You what?
4741,Only last year in fact. 
4742,"Exactly, apple made it better."
4743,"The keynote says that, the tear down says otherwise; I believe it was said that the S1 also has dual core, just like the S2, not necessarily they are the same

Edit: for those downvoting, sorry I didn‚Äôt spend my time on trying to back my point. [Here is the Series 2 teardown](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple+Watch+Series+2+Teardown/67385) (note it days S2 SIP on the Step 1) and [here is the Series 1 teardown](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Apple_Watch_Series_1) (which says S1P processor under Specifications). Although they are different it is also correct that people are reporting similar speed between the two."
4744,It is quite cool when you go running outside.
4745,The Apple Watch actually can though...
4746,that's only 11 years lol
4747,"Gear S2 can be had for under $100. The Huawei is a lot thicker too. To be fair, they both look very similar in black so you would like the S2 classic"
4748,"Hahaha there are literally Redditors on /r/watches with collections filled with six-figure pieces, I'm pretty small fish as far as this ridiculous hobby goes :)"
4749,"> I wanted something timeless understated and clean while still looking smart.

May I recommend the [Seiko Presage](https://www.laguardajoiers.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/3c39554054c21533f2a8cc939c033642/s/j/sje073j1.jpg)? It actually has a high quality in-house automatic movement for about half the price as the B&M. 

If you like the clean, minimalist design, [Junghans](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/junghans-form-a-value-proposition) is also a great option to look at..

If you have a specific B&M Classima you like (it's a pretty wide range of styles for a single line), you can link me and maybe I can recommend something closer."
4750,If you stretch your budget and buy a Nomos I don't think you'll be sorry. 
4751,"Sure, here are some links for reading

Some of Rado stuff is neat, but stylistically never messed with what I typically would wear."
4752,Just with my iPhone :) 
4753,"He‚Äôs talking about quality/fit/finish. 

You may not like the subjective aesthetic of the watch, but there‚Äôs no denying it has better quality materials and a polish to it that no other smartwatch has. 

The unibody curved stainless steel case is pretty remarkable, simply from a craftsmanship point of view. It‚Äôs high end materials like a curved sapphire crystal display, sapphire crystal lenses for the heart rate sensors, and ceramic back are high quality materials.  Nothing you would ever come close to approaching on any android wear device. 

Now, all put together you may still subjectively think it‚Äôs ugly. And that‚Äôs a valid opinion. But that‚Äôs not what he was talking about. "
4754,"Given I scratched the face of my Fossil smart watch, I can tell"

4756,"> And Google Voice is fully supported on iOS. 

Does that mean you can make Google Voice calls with Siri and through bluetooth?"
4757,Because it‚Äôs gonna be too slow if iOS 13 is really gonna get a design change.
4758,Why are you switching back?
4759,"Not for any digital content. Try renting a movie. They force you to buy it on your web browser and then you can open the app and go to your rentals section to watch it. 

From the app you can only add it to your wishlist. "
4760,"And other apps that support Chromecast. Regardless though, point being is that it works on both platforms. ie: Spotify, Pocket Casts, etc."
4761,Samsung's watches aren't running Wear OS.
4762,Well I guess everyone is entitled to their opinions :)
4763,"Herein lies the problem. I don't find the pressing need for smartwatches in general to mimic the appearance of ""regular"" watches. If I wanted one that looks like mechanical I'd buy a real mechanical.

Until then, feel free to preach to the choir how an Apple Watch is more similar to Fisher-Price than a fake Rolex."
4764,"Indeed you did. Like all normal humans I experience this weird thing called ""emotions"" "
4765,That makes this sound like a bit more of a tech fixation thing rather than a tangible benifit. It's something that really only applies to a small audience and even at that it is a novelty that can only matter for so long before it's forgotten.
4766,"Tizen lag doesn't really have anything to do with WearOS. 

Again as I said updates aren't really an issue like on phones, the flagship watches like the Huawei watch are supported just as long.

You can definitely do Google Assistant shortcut integration via Tasker or other apps.

Just got a full redisign so possibly, going to have to be specific about what you don't like."
4767,There's an option in the workout settings that disables the constant heart-rate monitor to save battery during workouts. Never turned it on so I'm unsure of how much you actually save tho
4768,"IDK, but my does last 3.5 to 4 days and I wear it all the time. I also keep turn off always on because it will only last around 2 days.

I turned off all the fit stuff off. I think that is why it last 4 days. I don't need to know how many steps I took!"
4769,I wear it every day. I just take it off when it gets near water or when I sleep. 
4770,"They couldn‚Äôt do that before, which was the point."
4771,You still know your shit and wrote it up in a way that even someone like me who's not really looking for a watch at the moment found interesting enough to read all the way through. It's impressive.
4772,"Love than Junghans! I like a simple white and round face with a leather strap. And I'd swap the strap out for other color leather. Don't like the steel band for some reason but my taste may change. I began looking for a Classima to link you but am on mobile...and didn't realize they had versions with blue hands...

4773,"Wow. I love that. However, I don't know much about watches. So what makes it different from, say, a 20$ piece that looks similar?"
4774,"Interesting, thanks for the links!

I think Sinn are great tool watches, and their hardening process makes them fantastic for the value. But personally I like that polished stainless steel look haha, can't say no to being shiny :)"
4775,"In theory yes, but it depends on if Google support it"
4776,"I have had several problems with their keyboard, dropped calls (on Verizon and my fianc√©‚Äôs 7plus works fine), Apple car play doesn‚Äôt support half the apps I use. Plus the way they handle notifications, and other things I don‚Äôt like. I have had android since day one with the G1. Just seem to prefer it. I also carry a iPhone 7 for work. To also add their little app back button is shit to try and hit. I also don‚Äôt like how to clear good notifications in the drop down pane is to hit a tiny little x then tap it again to clear. I hit it the first time for a reason. I don‚Äôt need to confirm I want to clear them.  "
4777,This is true. You still need to but a Google Chromecast though. Samsung's and kgs work on Miracast etc. Existing standards that are more open. 
4778,Well you only said smartwatch.
4779,Never claimed so
4780,I think the Apple watch looks unique and clean. Android watchers look like cheap replicas
4781,OP‚Äôs opinion is wrong. Nothing about the AW looks like a kid‚Äôs watch. OP is being hyperbolic. 
4782,"ok

4783,Oh I prefer the constant monitoring. Its not a big deal for me to charge it. It charges pretty quick.
4784,They couldn‚Äôt stream it but they could play off of their internal memory which seems like a pretty usable feature to me.
4785,"For sure, that was an enjoyable read. It's cool coming across someone passionate and knowledgeable about something rather than throwing around buzzwords. "
4786,"Yep, seems like the design style you like is Bauhaus school of design. There are quite a few brands (mostly German) that do them very well, with Nomos being my favorite (although may be slightly outside your price range).

You can do a quick google on ‚ÄúBauhaus watches‚Äù and you should see a lot of good options :) 

Best of luck!"
4787,"See it in person and the quality differences will be obvious. There is the material differences such as high quality polished stainless steel and sapphire crystal dial, and then there will be drastic differences in finishings on the detail. I‚Äôve seen cheap watches where the hour marks aren‚Äôt even perfectly aligned.

Secondly the one I linked has an actual mechanical movement, which no $20 watches will have. A sure tell is that the second hand ‚Äúglide‚Äù across the face at about 6-8 beats per second, instead of ticking at 1/s rate (there are mechanical watches that ‚Äúticks‚Äù, but those are haute horology pieces that easily cost $20k+).

"
4788,Can‚Äôt you just swipe left? Finally have google maps on CarPlay and Apple Music on Android auto.
4789,"Yeah of course you need a Chromecast, but my point is that at least it allows you to use it cross platform."
4790,I do not like Apple Music and still use Google Play music. Unfortunately GPM is less than stellar on Apple Care Play. And yes you can swipe left. But that was only recently available when the X came out. I know they are now switching to it. Plus the biggest thing is I miss my widgets too from Android. 
4791,Chris platform using a Google product. It's closed to Google product is what I'm getting at. Google to Google. 
4792,"> But that was only recently available when the X came out

Swipe left was introduced in iOS 7..."
4793,I thought you had a X
4794,"Yeah, I get what you're saying, but at least their closed product is still more open to everyone. "
4795,"I do still have my X. 
"
4796,But less open than existing standards that other phones use. I mean it goes Apple < Google < major android phones. 
4797,"I 100% agree with you, but I was just talking from a consumer standpoint, I'd rather be using something cross platform rather than something that's forcing me to stay with an iPhone or Mac or whatever else. "
4798,"I 100% agree with your haha. Although I have a Mac, PC and Android and never connect them haha. Android gets no OS integration at all unfortunately, only browser. I guess that's better than great integration to only one OS"

4800,"How long until a slightly modified version is released as the OnePlus Watch?

If this would run the 4100 platform, it would be an instant buy for me. At 249‚Ç¨, I'll just wait for the first 4100 watches. The next Fossil most likely won't have it, but they might a revision later on that has 4100."
4801,so OEMs are allowed to skin Wear OS now?
4802,"Indeed, 1GB of RAM or GTFO.

Typed that while looking disappointingly at my Fossil Sport."

4805,Really curious about the price
4806,"WearOS on a square screen is where it's at. Man I wish it weren't such an Apple copycat though.

I'm curious about the battery life though. That's unusually bad for that size of battery. Wonder if Oppo's ""optimizations"" fucked something up?"

I am only concerned about its battery life because my Apple Watch easily gets through a day and still has around 40-45% charge left. If Oppo watch is able to get through a day easily, then I feel it‚Äôs a total bang for buck. I would easily recommend it to a lot of my friends who are on Android."

4829,Ew. Gross.

4832,I'm looking for a replacement just frustrated that it won't be released until October in the UK
4833,Michael talks about in the video how its really more about getting 1gb+ of RAM rather than a new chipset. An extra co-processor and smaller chip fab won't help you much if you still only have 512mb or 756mb of RAM.

4835,Rectangular screen and an actually decent processor? Day one purchase.

4837,"Yeah because if that's the case, Samsung should just skin Wear OS on the Galaxy Watch instead of using Tizen just like they do with Android on their phones. Tizen's lack of some important stuff like Google Assistant, Google Maps, Shazam etc are deal breakers."

4858,Er no. 768MB ram is where the performance starts going up massively.
4859,"Actually it will help a lot. Almost all of the jank and lag you get on your watch is due to slow CPU and apps doing unnecessary work in the background.

So a better performing CPU, with better power efficiency is huge. It's why the Samsung and Apple watches work so well. (other than those platforms squashing background app CPU usage)."
4860,But I doubt Samsung will do that since they've been rocking Tizen for years already and have also gained a legacy with it

4868,"Yeah, nah. The ZenWatch series, Sony smartwatch series, Pebble watches, all do not look like an Apple watch. This is very clearly meant to imitate it. Dude, look at the packaging it comes in, look at the default watch faces, look at the watch straps and casing. It's literally meant to imitate the AW."
4869,I am in vacations right now and i dont have a pc available. When i return i will surely give a try!!
4870,There have been several square android wear watches that are square. Its just been a few years since we've seen a new one.
4871,"I use that. Honestly its not that bad. I just want my watch to get me through a day. No matter how long it is. I have always managed to charge it once every 24 hrs. So it‚Äôs ok for me. Even after the AOD I have 40-45% at the end of the day. But yes, I don‚Äôt use my watch too much for workouts and stuff. But even then I believe I will come down to a minimum of 10% at the end of the day which is fine for me as long as I am in a position to recharge it."
4872,"Update: I just saw [this](https://www.reviewgeek.com/49250/oppo-watch-confirmed-for-uk-release-with-wear-os-and-heart-rate-monitoring/) article which says ""A representative from OPPO tells us that the OPPO Watch is only available to US buyers through Amazon UK. The watch itself functions perfectly in the US, although the 46mm LTE version may not work with US carriers."""
4873,"It absolutely doesn't look like an AW.

- Size is different

- Screen is curved on left and right edges

- Armbands attachment is different

- Buttons are very different

- Screen is more edge to edge"
4874,"Work had one, that I used for a short while. It was nice."
4875,"I do too. It's definitely got its quirks, but I still do."
4876,"Yeah, it's a bitter sweet kinda watch. Love it when it works and feel like throwing it on a wall when it doesn't"

4878,Oh wow thank you!
4879,"Sorry my comment was dumb, I read too quickly üòÖ

I agree for the packaging, OK, but really not for the design of the watch. I think the Oppo is much much better than the AW design wise."
4880,"Pebble watches designed to imitate Apple Watches ?

Dude, you are joking or you just don't know ? 

Pebble were designed before AW.

When you make a rectangular and rounded watch you end up having close designs without necessarily copying."
4881,"So, the worst Wear OS watch still has a better Battery life with AOD than the AW.

And Samsung Active 2 can go for 3 days with AOD."
4882,Hmmmmmm....i wonder how accurate that is because Amazon uk doesn't allow US shipping addresses
4883,"> Pebble watches designed to imitate Apple Watches ?

No, he said the exact opposite. The ones he listed together with the Pebble were examples of square watches that **don't** look like the Apple Watch.

This Oppo watch on the other hand looks a lot like an Apple Watch, especially compared to the Pebble and the other ones he listed which have their own design identity."
4884,"Yes. Ofc I do know that. But in terms of the smoothness of the OS, notifications swooping in at the right time, the haptic feedback on AW( this is just too big of a deal to me now- can‚Äôt go back ever) and other such small things made me just love AW more than these watches. WearOS tbh has a lot of potential in my eyes. Its just that Google hasn‚Äôt taken it seriously and realised its true potential. 
Samsung Active is more of a fitness watch rather than a true smartwatch. Yes I will agree it does all the things but the Tizen OS part just doesn‚Äôt have my attention. It infact repels me tbh given everything I have heard about it in terms of the poor app support on it."
4885,Samsung is running Android?
4886,"I have actually ordered from Amazon UK before, so maybe there are just restrictions on certain items? Or maybe it's more limited now due to the pandemic?"
4887,"Hoooo yes ! Thanks for pointing that to me I read too quickly !üòÖ

For me the Oppo does have its own design identity :

- Curved edges

- No crown

- Specific buttons design

- Specific bands attachment

The only common design point with the AW is just the global shape : rounded rectangle. Whaooo Apple didn't invent the rounded rectangle."
4888,"Did you actually use a Samsung Active ?

It is as least as smart, if not a smarter watch than any Wear OS one. I have both platforms and Wear OS is years behind Tizen except for voice recognition. The Active 2 is the closest thing to the Apple Watch. Lots of apps, a good ecosystem and integration with Samsung apps...
Ah and lots of watchfaces too ... thing that Apple  didn't bother to propose... and three times the battery life with AOD.

Wear OS is still in a quite uncertain situation unfortunately."
4889,Interesting.... Guess I'll just sit back and see how it plays out then.
4890,"This watch looks a lot like the Apple Watch and it's pretty clear to me that that was what they were aiming for too. There are a few details that are different as you point out, but everything else is as close of a direct copy they could reasonably get away with."
4891,I used a WearOS watch. I haven‚Äôt used Samsung Active but one of my friends had it and he wasn‚Äôt quite satisfied with the app ecosystem. I don‚Äôt know what apps were missing but I just know that much.
4892,I'll let you know if I find out more.
4893,"Since people are already familiar with the AW shape, doing the same should attract customers"
4894,"I get that, but, I mean we can say the same about round watches no?  I mean unless its a triangle or something its either gotta be round or square no?"
4895,"It's best to try by yourself if you can.
For Samsung watches, it's better to have a Samsung phone. And then there is nothing to regreat from the Apple Watch."
4896,Thanks man!!  I'll do the same
4897,"No. There are very clear differences between most of the round watches that make them clearly distinct designs. This Oppo watch is so heavily ""inspired"" by the Apple Watch design that arguing otherwise becomes ridiculous."
4898,Looks like you seem to have a beef with AW
4899,"Hey, FYI it seems to be available for preorder on the UK Amazon site now. It says it's out of stock, but it lets you place the order and will ship when it's available. https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08CY8DNDQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_btf_t1_MaznFbNB1JHH0"
4900,"Like what, the dials or buttons on the side? Like how apple has a dial and oppo has a button?  I get that they look alike... But to act like it's some big deal they are shaped the same is a bit ridiculous.  Look at the fossil 5 and Movado watch, they look identical.  Now, does it need to be an oval?  Have two buttons instead of 3?  The point is the total package, not just a shape.  So yeah, the outer design is inspired, or imitated.  Who gives a shit."
4901,"Well not really. This is one of the finest smartwatches available, but the ecosystem is too closed, the battery life is not so good, there are practically no watchfaces to choose from (whitch is a complete dealbreaker for me) AOD is not good, armbands are proprietary and it's quite overpriced IMHO."
4902,"Preorder in stock here....

4903,Thanks G!   I'm holding out for the 46mm
4904,"> Like what, the dials or buttons on the side?

Ok, let's see:

* Band design
* Band material
* Band color
* Watch body finish
* Watch body shape (i.e. the same or very similar rounded corner radius, etc.)
* Watch face design (at least in product pictures)

> I get that they look alike...

Ok, so why claim that basically the only similarity is that they are both rectangular? That is what I think is ridiculous since they are clearly a lot more similar than that, which anyone can see. Should that stop anyone from buying it if they like it? No.

> Who gives a shit.

It would certainly prevent me from buying one personally since at least the pictures make it look like a cheap knock-off (despite probably having great build quality). It's just unnecessarily lazy to copy a design to this degree, but it's almost certainly because that's what works well in the Chinese market.

For people who like the Apple Watch look but who wants a watch that works well with Android, this looks like a must-have. Despite what you might think, I actually like that Oppo is getting into the Wear OS game and also like that we once again get multiple form factors for Wear OS watches. If Oppo can generate excitement for the platform and push build quality standards back up, I'm all for it. We've been in a slump for years now in both those areas."
4905,Well that‚Äôs basically Apple to be precise. They are known for being notorious for exercising control everywhere possible. AOD is ok for me at least. Cannot say about other‚Äôs experience though but I am fine with it. Same goes for the battery life. And obviously Apple being Apple they will keep their bands proprietary. Hell they haven‚Äôt phased out lightning ports on iPhone till now. Price wise - yes it‚Äôs overpriced. But then this is Apple. It‚Äôs not like I am trying to defend them here. But that‚Äôs how they have always been. They are just too focused on their revenues and they know that people are willing to shell out money (at least for now). So why not cash in on that opportunity. Every Apple product just seems overpriced tbh. But they are willing to keep it that way as long as people are paying.
4906,Thanks! Do you know if it matters if we order from Germany vs the UK?
4907,"I wouldn't summarize it better than you do.

The fact is when you compare with a Samsung Watch active 2 AND if you have a Samsung phone, the Active 2 seems a lot better in quite some aspects.

When you compare with a Fossil gen 5 ... no, please don't do it üòÖüòÇü§£üòÇ.

Apple devices are overpriced but you still can sell it for a good price. Other brands loose most of their value as soon as you open the box. So the price difference is not so bog that it looks."
4908,Not sure..... But they both do appear to ship to USA.
4909,Until Tesla rolls out the feature I‚Äôll stay away. I‚Äôm not giving credentials to my car to a third party
4910,"I have this app and it is excellent! really handy to do everything but drive from your Apple Watch (granted your watch must have cellphone feature enabled and I do have it) when your phone isn‚Äôt with you ‚Ä¶ evidently you‚Äôd still need the phone to drive the car, but that‚Äôs it. I highly recommend:

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watch-app-for-tesla/id1512108917"
4911,"Tesla will spend godly amounts of software engineering resources on unnecessary complete overhauls of their UI but won‚Äôt put time into developing a smart watch app, arguably something with much more usefulness than anything V11 has brought."
4912,I use it and love it.
4913,"I use it, and I think it‚Äôs pretty cool.  If you have any reservations about security then it‚Äôs best to stay away, but it‚Äôs been very handy during last minute Costco runs when my hands are full"
4914,I only use it when I forget my phone in the house and need to get into my car
4915,Why would you need to take your phone out to open the trunk?
4916,I use ‚ÄúTesla remote‚Äù app works for watch.
4917,What about battery life? I‚Äôve read it consumes faster because the car needs to be active (like sentient mode)
4918,"I use it and LOVE IT. I set it up so I lift my wrist and say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs roll‚Äù and it unlocks my car, sets the temp and turns the car on.
Lots of features. One of the few apps I actually spent $ on‚Ä¶.
For battery usage, you can set it tin‚Äùping‚Äù the car (I have it set to hourly from 6am till 11pm) so it stays current with the stats"
4919,I use it also (actually have two watch apps). It also makes creating shortcuts 10x easier (I.e. I can setup a shortcut to preheat my car when my alarm for work goes off).
4920,I use it.. it's actually not bad.. sometimes it logs out which is annoying but 99% of the time it does the job
4921,I use it all the time. I open the trunk with it and I have a widget in the corner that shows me the battery percentage got while I‚Äôm charging
4922, Use one called ‚ÄúWatchla‚Äù
4923,"I don't know how it works for the iPhone but I'm on the Garmin one (which is a free app on Garmin store with source on GitHub), nothing leaves your phone. It creates a token that is used to talk to Tesla's infrastructure. I know because I'm working with the source for that app."
4924,Exactly. Wasn‚Äôt the last report of Teslas being ‚Äúhacked‚Äù revolving around a third-party app?
4925,Been thinking about developing a self-hosted version of one of these apps. Would you consider using that? I feel like some of them are lacking in UX & Features but understand the security concerns.
4926,"So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way"
4927,That‚Äôs how that massive hacker was able get control of every single Tesla that had their account details out into his app for cool features.
4928,"Nope, you can remote start with the app. Don‚Äôt need the phone or a key!"
4929,Not sure how that makes sense. You can just close the app when you‚Äôre not using it.
4930,"But if the app is compromised so is the communication, isn‚Äôt it? And Tesla doesn‚Äôt make it easy to manage tokens/api keys so it can be a hassle"
4931,"Right, and once you have a token you can tell the car to do anything you want, and harvest any data you want"
4932,"Specifically, it was the self-hosted websites that were hacked.  Not the app itself.

People need to change default credentials when they host sites."
4933,I wouldn‚Äôt use anything self hosted to be honest‚Ä¶ it would have to use Teslas API‚Äôs
4934,"Wouldn‚Äôt it need to go through the Tesla servers anyways and therefore would require either API keys or credentials? 

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve looked into this but has tesla developed a better way to manage said API keys and make it easier to track usage and allow to easily revoke them?"
4935,"It uses the same undocumented/unsupported API that every other sources like teslafi, Optiwatt uses. If Tesla ever decides to harden their communication technology, they will all stop working at once. I sure hope it doesn't come to that because I do love my Teslamate and Garmin watch app."
4936,">So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way

Its not the app on the watch controling your car.. that is not possible because everything needs to go through tesla servers and be verified with tokens etc. Basically what the app does is imitate the original tesla app by issuing the same commands and using its token. If it is open source and it can be seen that the tokens are stored on your device not on some db hosted with the developer then it is safe as it works exactly like the original. But as you said those token gives access to your car and anyone sharing them needs to be cautious about it."
4937,"I did use the ‚Äúremote start‚Äù under settings before to remote start the car before heading to the garage, but then my phone was with me ‚Ä¶ will try without the phone altogether."
4938,"Compromised how? By a malicious attack? By code written to harvest your credentials? That's what I like about open source code, you can check it yourself and if that is not enough, compile your own version (which is what I do, but not out of fear, but so I have access right away to the features I add).

On my Garmin, when it needs to connect, it asks for my username password on my phone (through the Garmin app) and that is used to generate the token."
4939,"Yeah, but that token cannot simply be stolen like that. It's not like it's laying around. It's within the apps realm only."
4940,"There‚Äôs two ways you would do this where you wouldn‚Äôt share your credentials with a third party. 

First is to make the requests directly to Teslas servers from an application, second would be to set up a self-hosted server that facilitates interaction with Tesla‚Äôs servers and no third party. 

Either way you‚Äôre typing your credentials into an ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù app, they‚Äôre just never going anywhere but to either yourself, or Tesla.

I haven‚Äôt looked into how Tesla handles authentication, but I doubt they have an Oauth system."
4941,Did it work?
4942,"I'm not suggesting it can be ""stolen"" because it doesn't need to be, it's already been given freely to the app.

Once you have the token, the app can harvest data it wants, and can send whatever command it wants. The developer can do anything the token has access to do."
4943,"Yes, that's why I mentioned in a different thread that open source is a great way to prevent that. The Tesla app on my Garmin watch has its source on GitHub so you can see what it does and if you're very paranoid, you can compile your own copy (like I do but not for that reason but to have the features I added right away and not wait for the updated app to appear on the store).

Your concerns apply to anything you install on your watch, phone, computer, etc. that does not come from your service suppliers."
4944,"Yes I agree, that's why I don't log my accounts into third parties."
4945,"If you want to gather stats but want to stay local, look into Teslamate. It runs on many types of devices, including a Raspberry Pi at less than $100. It's open source and runs interpreted so no compiled code. Much harder to sneak harmful code. Through Linux firewall, you can restrict access to just Tesla's server being queried so almost impossible to steal the token.

I didn't go that far but I do have a proxy in front of it that encrypt all data between the outside world and my instance, plus its installation is hardened with username/password."
4946,"The people that are trying to protect their data harvesting businesses are down voting you too now. 

If I wanted to gather data for myself id do exactly as you described. I honestly don't think most of these people understand the danger of giving a third party access to your secrets."
4947,"Well, yes? Probably the best smartwatch on the market - why should it be bad?"
4948,"Yes. It will be the best Apple Watch available when it comes out. Don‚Äôt listen to everyone talking down on it. People are just upset it didn‚Äôt have more features to push them to upgrade. Im sticking with my series 4, but if I was currently in the market for my first Apple Watch, the Series 7 is a no brainer.

Edit: the SE is certainly another good option. Steer clear of the Series 3."
4949,Yes of course!!! Either the SE or the 7 depending on what you want your watch to do and budget most definitely
4950,Yes.
4951,"If you don‚Äôt have a series 4, 5, and specially a 6 and you can afford it, then yes my friend!!!"
4952,"Everything depends on your budget, I would say. If you want one and can afford a series 7, go for it. It is absolutely a better experience than series 3, but most is fine with series 3."
4953,"I think SE is a better option. I'm choosing between the SE and Series 7. The only feature Series 7 has the I'd want is the bigger screen. Apart from that, the ECG and O2 are just gimmicks, probably something you use it once and leave it be (my current watch has ECG and I only used it once or twice).

Always on display could be a bummer, but as soon as you raise your wrist the screen comes on, so not a big deal, imo."
4954,Don‚Äôt go for the 3! The 3 was already a bad purchase a year ago‚Ä¶ Save up a bit more and get an SE.
4955,wAiT FOR SeRies 12
4956,"I just posted a similar question, here‚Äôs the thread. I ended up going with the 7, but I do plan to use it quite a lot. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/qiuloy/se_vs_7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
4957,"Get the SE. Since you‚Äôre 14, many of the Health features won‚Äôt benefit you. You can‚Äôt use ECG anyways‚Ä¶ Since you won‚Äôt rely on it as much as you said, might as well keep the money and use it towards a better phone instead."
4958,"I didn‚Äôt want to pay for the 7 but wanted AOD. So I just got an open-box six on Ebay for 275 w. free shipping, same cost as a new SE. I think I‚Äôm going to be happy with it, assuming the seller actually sends it and it‚Äôs in the promised condition üòÇ. If not, of course, there‚Äôs always the eBay money back guarantee."
4959,"I got the series 7 on launch day; it is my first smart watch. After having it for two weeks, I'd say I wish I had gotten the SE when it came out last year instead of waiting all this time for the 7. Blood oxygen sensor and ECG are total gimmicks, so unless you have a legitimate cardiovascular health concern, I'd save a few dollars and go with the SE. Fast charging and the big screen are nice, but I don't think it justifies the increase in price. Also the keyboard is a bitch to actually use. Go with the SE, I think you'll like it."
4960,"As a 15 year old, and considered to get an Apple Watch about a month ago, I was in the same shoes. 

As a first time Apple Watch owner myself, I chose the SE over the S7 about a month ago. It really depends on if you really think you‚Äôre going to utilize all the features of the new 7. I myself new right from the start that I would never use the Blood Oxygen or the ECG feature, and I realized the Always On Display didn‚Äôt matter to me at all because I mostly wear long sleeves and if I really wanted to glance at the time, I could just turn the digital crown a bit.

I‚Äôd say go for the SE to try it out, and if it really suits you, just hang on to the SE for some time (it‚Äôs such a good watch still a year after release) and upgrade to a new watch when there are actually significant updates or new features that you will **actually** use or utilize to its potential.

**TLDR: I‚Äôd recommend the SE, most of the features in the 7 will probably not be taken advantaged for for a 14 year old (ECG, Blood Oxygen can‚Äôt be used). Unless you really want the always on display or the faster charging, then I wouldn‚Äôt. SE has really served me well, no regrets getting it over the 7. I have the one with cellular, no complaints here. If you really want the always on display, consider a used or refurbished series 5. I barely see a difference with the always on display if I had it, as I always seem to wear long sleeves anyways, which would completely defeat the purpose.**"
4961,"I had the SE before, I didn‚Äôt upgrade but it‚Äôs a long story and now i have the S7, let me tell you that I wouldn‚Äôt really have upgraded, now the S7 is soooo nice, big screen, faster charging, keyboard, always on display and more health sensors, i would say if you don‚Äôt care about always on display, the screen difference isn‚Äôt something that you would notice, it is something that you get used to, if you got the SE believe me the bigger bezels aren‚Äôt that noticeable, and the faster charging is nice, but if you have time before sleep that you don‚Äôt need your watch the SE is good enough, the health sensors, well it depends you know more about yourself of course, hopefully I didn‚Äôt miss a lot, i would say that you won‚Äôt regret both, if you have any questions don‚Äôt be bothered to ask me üëç"
4962,"I
Don‚Äôt think the ECG would actually work for you if you go by your real age. There‚Äôs a age requirement to use the feature."
4963,"SE, save your money and put the difference in a ROTH"
4964,"I had the 7, returned and got SE. Didn't really need the extras."
4965,"Id go with the SE just because it can do almost everything the 7 can do. Another option that I‚Äôd highly recommend is to check third party retailers like Best Buy and Target, I saw the Series 6 for $250 on Best Buy one day which is an insane deal considering you aren‚Äôt missing out much from the 7"
4966,"Unless you plan on getting stainless steel, just get an SE. I would opt for the 7 just for the sapphire display if you‚Äôre anything like me and have your tendency to bump your wrist against hard surfaces only while wearing a watch. 

If you‚Äôre super careful and don‚Äôt care about scratches, get the SE. 

Either way it goes, you only realize you bought an overpriced computer for your wrist (that still comes in handy sometimes) after you buy it. 

But someone here said it best: Buy what you can afford. We can‚Äôt justify your wallet. Only you can."
4967,I‚Äôm 14 too and I‚Äôm considering getting a SE Nike 44MM for my birthday
4968,"I went for the SE, had it a few days and it seems pretty good. Battery life is getting better and looks like it will run two days now. Most of the features of the 7 are there in some form, it doesn‚Äôt have ECG for instance but still checks for irregular heart and notifies."
4969,I don‚Äôt use the O2 sensor nor the ECG and still bought the series 7. The bigger screen is gorgeous and I like the new colours (starlight). I‚Äôm 28 and have a good job tho so thankfully for me the price gap between the SE and the Series 7 wasn‚Äôt a decisive factor. If you‚Äôre tight on money go for the SE. You‚Äôll love it
4970,I‚Äôm also 14 and I have the SE 40mm and it‚Äôs perfect for me so I‚Äôd recommend the SE ;)
4971,"I waited from July till 2 weeks ago for the 7 and wish I would‚Äôve just bought the SE. Blood Oxygen and ECG are not useful for me and I doubt I will ever use it, I just thought they were gonna add more features but it‚Äôs whatever now."
4972,"It seems you‚Äôre only paying half for it, which means the SE would cost $140 and the S7 $200 (or a little more for the larger sizes). I recommend the S7, as the larger display alone is worth $60 to me."
4973,"I got a refurbished 6, seems like the 7 wasn‚Äôt much of an upgrade"
4974,"The only difference between the se and the 7 is ecg, blood oxygen, always on display, and a larger display.

I would also look into the series 6. It‚Äôs slightly cheaper than the 7, but it does all the same things.

I‚Äôd say that the 6 or 7 is worth the extra money just because of the always on display. It makes it much more convenient to check the time while doing something like typing."
4975,"If someone is buying it for you, get the S7"
4976,Dang it kid save your money for college unless you're parents are rich?
4977,The SE is litteral shit
4978,"Lmao nah, I think at least series 14."
4979,"Just wondering, would you still have stuck with the 7 if you weren‚Äôt planning to use it as much?"
4980,Thanks a lot!
4981,"Ah okay, thanks for the honest opinion. I know the ECG and oxygen sensor aren‚Äôt important to me but just wondering would you consider the always on mode an important factor?"
4982,"Thank you for the in depth answer, just wondering did the upgrade overall feel worth it?"
4983,"Oh I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks, however I think I am mainly focused on other factors such as the screen size and always on mode."
4984,"Oh ok, any reasoning behind your choice?"
4985,"Yeah I can stretch mine from Friday morning and have to put it on Sunday afternoon-night so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it on the weekends. 

I think my only negative is not having always on. I used to not mind, but if my band is just a little too loose, how I like it when I‚Äôm not working, it doesn‚Äôt activate."
4986,"Ok that‚Äôs good to hear, is there anything you feel your missing though?"
4987,"That‚Äôs good to hear as screen size is a key factor I‚Äôm thinking about, thanks for the info!"
4988,"Ah okay, thank you. Will the fact that the Apple Watch 6 has been discontinued affect anything?"
4989,"Haha, I‚Äôm actually paying for half of it."
4990,"It‚Äôs really not. My friend has an SE, upgraded from Series 3 and he is super content! But I respect your opinion"
4991,"I am wearing one right now, and I can confirm that it is in fact not literal shit."
4992,"Hmmm probably not. The SE is a really great option if you‚Äôre just using it mostly as a way to check notifications and activity progress. Lots of people claim that it‚Äôs really the best value for the price- it does almost everything the 7 can do.  I was on the SE train for a while until recently when reading more about the Always on screen. Personally, I‚Äôm an impatient person and would get easily annoyed if I lifted my wrist and didn‚Äôt see something right away. I‚Äôm also in a good place financially so I can afford to splurge on it. If your budget is tight, I recommend waiting until Black Friday/cyber monday and see if you can find any good deals on the SE, or the 5 and 6 are good options as well. Slickdeals.net is a site I use to track deals. 

Either way, you‚Äôre going to get a really great watch and if you have buyers remorse, you can likely return and switch pretty easily. Hope this helps!"
4993,"I would say if you‚Äôre not used to wearing a watch, the AOD is nice to have but not essential at all, and the SE is an excellent choice. I was quite happy with my S3 when I had it. But I‚Äôve got used to having always-on now, and I‚Äôd absolutely miss it if I went back to a watch without it."
4994,the always on and edge to edge screen make it worth it to me
4995,"Nope, you would barely notice it."
4996,"Did the same and would say yes if money isn‚Äôt an issue. Also depends what you‚Äôre going to use it for, personally I find always on display worth it as well as the new keyboard. However if you don‚Äôt find yourself using it to text people back much without using voice to text I‚Äôd go for the SE, as you‚Äôre young and better of saving the money or using it on something else."
4997,"Like i said I didn‚Äôt upgrade, sold the SE in july and bought this now, but I remember the SE and the exact experience, i can tell you the S7 is worth it if you can afford it without thinking twice about the money, and as a first watch yes, but for you like you said you don‚Äôt use your watch often, i would say the most important deciding factor for you is if you care about always on display or not."
4998,Then those will be the only other two benefits you will gain from 7 to SE. aluminum on 7 has more color options so there‚Äôs there‚Äôs a minor consideration. Then there‚Äôs the faster charging option for the 7.
4999,I don‚Äôt really want to drop 400 dollars on a Series 7 since I can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt need to use most of it‚Äôs features like ECG or blood oxygen. I want to get the Nike since it has more features without additional costs
5000,Not really. I‚Äôm still learning how the thing works to be honest. I don‚Äôt think the o2 reader or the ecg are worth the additional cost for my context.
5001,"No. Apple usually supports stuff for quite a while, they still support the Series 3 which came out 4 years ago.

They were also only recently discontinued, so you can still find them on amazon, and even some stores. I just got my series 6 last Sunday from an AT&T store. 

If you want to see what the series 6 looks like, go onto my profile. I just posted a pic of my watch to this sub yesterday"
5002,"I think this is the most sensible answer in this thread. The Always On Display is the killer feature as it means you don‚Äôt have to raise your wrist to tell the time or to see if it‚Äôs a notification that‚Äôs worth stopping and raising your wrist for. More importantly, some apps, like Workouts continue to display metrics when your wrist is lowered eg let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre riding a bike or running, glancing at your wrist while it‚Äôs down let‚Äôs you still see the data. On an SE the screen is off so you need to raise to see the info. 

If this feature matters to you, then look into Series 6. 

If it doesn‚Äôt matter then SE."
5003,What did you decide in the end OP
5004,"Thanks that helps a lot, budget isn‚Äôt really an issue for me but I guess I‚Äôm leaning for the SE now."
5005,"Oh, that‚Äôs a shame, thank you though."
5006,"Money isn‚Äôt really an issue for me and yeah, I think the main thing I‚Äôm considering at the moment is the always on display. Thanks for the help."
5007,Oh right sorry and thanks for the info.
5008,"Yes that is true, I think right now I‚Äôm focused on how important I find those factors as there aren‚Äôt too many reasons to go for 7."
5009,"I see, thanks for the help!"
5010,[deleted]
5011,That‚Äôs quite true and I probably won‚Äôt be needing it. I guess the main factors I‚Äôm concerned about are the screen size and always on mode.
5012,"Ah okay, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll be thinking about, thanks."
5013,[deleted]
5014,"No worries, you‚Äôre welcome üëç"
5015,Also the 7 has a slightly better chip. May not seem like much but I imagine future OS updates in the years down from now it would help. It also has U1 which SE doesn‚Äôt have. All may seem minor but just some specs to consider about.
5016,"Actually, you get a bunch of exclusive Nike watch faces as well that are not available to be downloaded elsewhere."
5017,"I guess different folks will feel differently about that. I know the 7 has more screen but using the se it doesn‚Äôt feel dated or that the screen is small for me. The idea of always on mode is nice n all but I don‚Äôt know why I would need my watch screen on when I‚Äôm not looking at it, the rise to look thing on the se when I tilt my wrist works really well and brings the screen on. If I had the 7 I think I would disable aod. We all have different use cases though so that might be very different to yours."
5018,No problem. Generally speaking every Apple Watch is good for 3 years before really big new features are added (I‚Äôve owned them since Series 0). Series 6 is from 2020 so you‚Äôre good till about Series 9 in 2023. Series 6 has exactly the same internals as a Series 7 minus fast charging.
5019,"There seems to be. I visited the website u/DIL3MMA mentioned and Target will roll out a deal for the SE in both sizes, the 40mm being $219. Big shoutout my guy, thanks!

I was unsure but I can‚Äôt really justify $180 more for the s7 as I‚Äôm really just using this as a workout device and notification checker."
5020,"That‚Äôs a good point, thanks."
5021,And you get to choose the Nike bands at first purchase which I think are better (especially the sport loop)
5022,The S7 screen is nice but it definitely hasn‚Äôt made the S4-S6/SE design/screens feel immediately dated the way the S4 did to the S0-S3.
5023,"Yeah, I guess I can see always on being irritating so I think I‚Äôll do a bit more research on that. Thanks for sharing."
5024,"For those who have an Apple Watch but don‚Äôt want to purchase a hardware option, I recommend the HeartCast app. It‚Äôs intuitive, has a responsive developer, and best of all it‚Äôs completely free. I find it to be reliable and, in my experience, it works better than Blueheart.

I‚Äôve considered purchasing heartbeatz in the past, so I appreciate this review nonetheless. It‚Äôs still on my buy list in the event the ‚Äúworkaround‚Äù watch apps stop working."
5025,"Interesting that it looks exactly like the Keiser m3i converter which converts the Keiser bike signal into a Bluetooth signal so you can connect the bike to a phone. It also looks just like the CABLE unit which connects Bluetooth devices to ANT+ devices.

Edit because I am an idiot. The people that make the heartbeatz is the same people who make the CABLE Bluetooth to ant unit. So they are essentially the same unit, but one is programed specifically to take the signal from the apple watch. The other takes any Bluetooth signal."
5026,This looks really cool! Can you use it with more than one Apple Watch (We have multiple riders in our house)?
5027,What other options exist for tracking your heart rate while riding? Trying to find a low cost option...
5028,"One thing I'll say which is an advantage to the heartbeatz over Bike+ Gymkit is that the HR works for an entire session, stretching included, whereas the Gymkit only works with rides, and it is annoying to reconnect with each ride. So if you do a warm up and cool down, that is 3 times you need to connect the watch. I may even start using the heartbeatz again now that I think about it."
5029,Thank you! I have been unable to get heartcast OR blue heart to work. I just think it‚Äôs crazy there‚Äôs no reliable workaround by now.
5030,"Has anyone compared this to HeartCast? Looking for a Blueheart replacement and these are the two I've seen mentioned the most.


Edit: Nevermind, just noticed heartbeatz has a hardware component which I'm not interested in -- I'll give HeartCast a shot as a Blueheart replacement for now."
5031,Have you tried the heartcast app and compared it to the heartbeatz hardware? I‚Äôm curious to what your thoughts are and if it‚Äôs worth the extra to buy heartbeatz?
5032,"Edit 2: have used HeartCast for the last 20 or so days...it‚Äôs been pretty great. Sometimes I need to restart the app on my Apple Watch to get it to synch with the phone app. Other than that, no other issues.

Edit: have used HeartCast for 4 rides without a problem. 

Thank you for this! My scoche HRM broke (the silver pin popped out, the plastic case cracked, etc) and I ended up getting an Apple Watch as a gift. I have the regular Bike & am going to test HeartCast before spending $ on heartbeatz."
5033,Awesome. Thanks for sharing.
5034,Under normal circumstances the apple watch only takes a reading ever few minutes or so. Does the Heartbeatz app on the watch increase the frequency of the apple watch measurements as well as broadcast to the dongle?
5035,My question as well!!
5036,"Yes, before buying a Bike+, both of us used the same heartbeatz on the bike."
5037,I use my HRM from orange theory fitness.  It works perfectly.  They are usually pretty cheap on eBay.
5038,"Fitbit, Apple Watch, Schosch HRM"
5039,Happy to help troubleshoot this with you. Feel free to send us a message on Instagram @ [HeartCastApp](https://instagram.com/heartcastapp/) \- or a DM here. :)
5040,">The two new sizes are 40mm and 44mm, but they really don‚Äôt feel that much bigger on your wrist than the old sizes. I was using the 42mm Series 3 and the 44mm size is only subtly bigger, but it‚Äôs also subtly thinner. To me, it feels about the same, but I think the trade-off of size for thinness is worth it.

Glad I stuck with my 44 preorder"
5041,"I‚Äôve been holding to my S0 for dear life waiting for the right moment to upgrade, I guess the moment is now"
5042,[deleted]
5043,"Nice review! Glad I made the decision to upgrade. 

The part where he was talking about Walkie Talkie is a little bit off. He made mention about needing to use a hand to hold down the button to talk, but in settings you can do tap to talk instead. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great look at the watch. Looking forward to Friday!"
5044,I miss the new clock design for my watch Series 3 :( 
5045,"Siri has been having that same problem lately for me where it is never ‚Äúready‚Äù when I try to use it. I thought it was cuz I had a series 2 and it was starting to get slow. Now I guess it‚Äôs just Siri being shitty in general.

Still wondering if the speed improvement is worth it over series 2. Seems like a series 0 upgrade would be a no brained, and series 3 probably not necessary. But for series 2?"
5046,Glad to hear the battery life is excellent 
5047,Anyone know what leather band that is? You can see him putting it on at :39 and it‚Äôs featured in a few shots on the full Verge review a few times: https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17875882/new-apple-watch-series-4-review-ekg-bands-screen-price
5048,Super excited to get mine Friday! It will be my first Apple Watch. I think I picked a good time to pull the trigger 
5049,first time buyer here! super excited to get in with the series 4. i get 225 off from my health care provider so its kinda a no brainer! 
5050,Does the walkie talky feature require LTE?
5051,Is that watch face in the thumbnail only available on the S4? I have an S3 N+ and I can‚Äôt find it anywhere in the Watch app.
5052,"My first time getting an Apple Watch (getting the Series 4). I‚Äôm excited and hope that it‚Äôll serve me well. I do need a MacBook Pro more, but I thought of that way after I ordered and I can‚Äôt afford it now anyways, so I‚Äôm looking forward to January when I‚Äôll have the possibility to get the MacBook Pro 13‚Äù and be fully integrated in the wonderful and polished Apple ecosystem! "
5053,So that watch face is exclusive to the series 4 üò≠
5054,Anyone else regretting buying the 3?
5055,"I gave my series 3 SS to wifey. I‚Äôm buying series 4 gold, I don‚Äôt plan to upgrading for a while. This is going to be a nice one. "
5056,"I love the line about ‚ÄúApple figuring out what the watch is for‚Äù to justify the initial poor reviews the Verge gave the Apple Watch when it first came out. Complete with awkward staged video to make notifications in the wrist look as bad as possible.

The Apple Watch hasn‚Äôt changed in ‚Äúwhat it was for‚Äù nor has Apple ‚Äúfigured out what it was for‚Äù. It has always been primarily about activity tracking and notifications."
5057,I have a series 3 with LTE I don't use (carrier restrictions). I am thinking of trading it in for a Series 4 without LTE
5058,What watch face is the one in the pic? Is it exclusive to models 3 and 4?
5059,"For an extra $100 over the previous gen, it better live up to the hype."
5060,I‚Äôd love to get mine but as of Wednesday today it‚Äôs still in China. 
5061,"I bought a S3 recently and I have to say, it's certainly reliable and does its job. Honestly, there's very little Apple can do to change my mind about upgrading it."
5062,Do you still have to buy the cellular model if you want more storage?
5063,"Walkie talkie that stayed on would be pretty dangerous. Forget it‚Äôs on, etc "
5064,"Yeah for the maxed out versions, but you forget that students don‚Äôt buy those. So when you look at the entry level, the price do not differ too much  (accounting for student discounts, which are better on Apple). And you should know that same specs don‚Äôt mean same performance when it comes to different operating systems. MacOS is very well optimized and can outperform PC‚Äôs with greater specs in certain productivity programs . Of course it‚Äôs a lot of money but you pay similarly for the offerings from Microsoft (the Surface line-up). For that price I‚Äôd rather pick up a more stable, organized and optimized system to do my productivity on (I don‚Äôt use any Windows-only programs). I payed 1250 euros for the Surface Pro which sucks compared to the MacBook Pro which sells for 1350 euros. Try some video editing on the Surface, you‚Äôll want to jump off a cliff. And the battery is horrendous, it lasts me 2,5 hours just taking notes on it when they promise 13,5... rather have the proved MacBook for that."
5065,"Coming up form the Verge, it‚Äôs easy to say it‚Äôs a good damn device"
5066,I‚Äôm afraid to read this. I‚Äôm one of those ‚Äúwhat a good chance to get a Series 3!‚Äù people. 
5067,I‚Äôd like to have Infograph on my Series 3!
5068,"I went with the 40mm, now I'm having second thoughts. Maybe I'll be able to trade in my preorder at the nearest Apple store if I don't like it"
5069,Same
5070,"I just can't justify the price.  The bigger SS watch with a sport band is now about as much ($750) as I believe I paid for my SS with the leather loop band (either $750 or $800, I can't quite remember).  I don't want to buy a sport watch because it won't match my other existing bands, but I also don't need LTE so I feel like buying the SS is throwing money away.

My series 0 still works fine.  I'm holding onto it until it dies.  "
5071,Same
5072,Yep. 
5073,Same
5074,Same but I have the milanese loop and not too sure if the sports version would look weird with it.
5075,Same
5076,"Same but ended up going with the reduced price S3 42mm SS with Milanese loop, versus the equivalent S4 44mm with AppleCare+ and taxes I saved ~$210.


I can‚Äôt believe how much faster this thing is."
5077,Agreed. This is a Nilay Patel level of complaint.
5078,Proper pinky-out coffee cup holding provides a suitable digit.  No?
5079,Hands full? There is an app for that. Phone app.
5080,And why not hold the coffee with the HAND WITH THE WATCH ON IT which frees up the other hand to operate the watch touch screen??
5081,"I agree it shouldn‚Äôt be a complaint really, but if you compare it to a real walkie talkie, the Apple Watch walkie talkie is technically harder to use as you can use a real one with just one hand. "
5082,"A real walkie talkie explicitly needs a ‚Äúpush‚Äù, it‚Äôs not a new thing. The Verge is being dumb."
5083,"Worst case you could simply say, ""Siri call So-and-So"" or ""Siri text So-and-So"" but if you can't bother to set your coffee down to touch your watch it can most likely wait. 

And to be perfectly honest, I don't see myself using this feature all too much."
5084,"They do provide a reasonable alternative: using your nose to push the button. It‚Äôs like turning on a light switch with your elbow. Sometimes your other hand just won‚Äôt work, especially if you‚Äôre carrying, say, a full, spill-able cup of coffee. Though I really don‚Äôt think the complaint is unwarranted because the two-handed nature of the interaction is part of the reason why the feature is so situational‚Äîif it was easier to use one-handed then it‚Äôd be more useful in more situations. "
5085,"I know, that was such an artificial complaint ... guess what you do when you cannot physically use the walkie talkie?  You don't.  Next he'll complain about how hard it is to text when driving in traffic at 80 mph.  Idiot."
5086,"I find my nose works well to push buttons on the watch when my hands are full, which happens pretty often when I‚Äôm using it for timers at work. "
5087,Lol no? But we‚Äôre in the future. Who uses light switches anymore? :)
5088,"As I watched the video, I thought it was a valid point that was raised.  Why a push to talk only option?  There should be an on and off toggle."
5089,"I think there‚Äôs some value to the complaint. I tried it and found it annoying for that reason. 

I can raise the watch to talk to Siri. I can raise the phone to listen to a voice message and reply. Confirmation could be done with an ‚Äúover‚Äù command. 

Or as sometimes I do when my other hand is full, confirm with my nose. "
5090,"But I don't have to do that.

""Hey Google, turn on the lights"""
5091,I didn't find it that big of a complaint. He showed how to get around it even. Any PTT device has the same issue...
5092,"I think it is more of a form factor complaint. Imagine if the walkie talkie worked on your phone, you can easily use it with just one hand. With Apple Watch, anything interactive involves your wrist to be turned towards you and your other hand to push a button.

I feel like they could have reused the raise to speak for Siri gesture to allow you to reply easier and with only one hand."
5093,Oh really?! How do you switch to tap to talk?
5094,[deleted]
5095,This needs to be higher
5096,Seriously. So jealous of the bigger screens. 
5097,Same
5098,"I never wait until Siri is ready. I just turn my wrist, tell Siri whats up and go about my business. It is still listening for the command."

5104,"Me too! Have wanted one since the S0 but couldn‚Äôt justify the cost. Now there‚Äôs a huge screen as well as LTE, it will be perfect for running!"
5105,"Whoa, how so? That‚Äôs great! "
5106,No as long as your phone is near you 
5107,Also can you walkie tally with someone on the other side of the world ?
5108,S4 only
5109,I also ordered my first Apple Watch ever (S4 44mm gold) so excited! Next year getting a new MacBook (currently have an air early 2013) and it‚Äôs time for an upgrade. 
5110,"Macs are amazing, but they're definitely overpriced. I loved mine when I got it though, had to end up selling it, but I play on getting the 2018 15 inch pro."
5111,Yes.  I really kinda just want that darn watch face.
5112,"Not really, other than the screen size, the other features are something you may once a handful of times."
5113,"I disagree. With the first model, they tried to make it about fashion and apps mostly. It wasn‚Äôt until the year after, with a somewhat big revamp of watchOS that they found a better focus. Activity tracking and notifications were already there of course, but every other smart watch had those too, so they tried something different. "
5114,"I am a day one Apple Watch owner (series 0,2& soon 4)

I get what you are saying, but I think there is some validity to that comment. Remember series 0 there was a $10,000 solid gold version, there were a number of high end fashion bands (Herm√®s). 

They made a play for both the luxury watch market (10k is more than a Rolex sub mariner) 

And a fashion watch. 

In addition they touted its work out abilities as a ‚ÄúFitbit ‚Äù/ wearable competitor.

And finely they had an open development platform so developers could develop apps for it...

After ~4 years they seemed to have focused on the fitness/health aspects of the watch, the gold one was series 0 only (I think, maybe also series 1?), Herm√®s is still around, but the ‚Äúapp‚Äù market for the watch seems far more focused, and from experience developing, they don‚Äôt seem particularly focused on 3rd party apps for the watch. 

For example, they don‚Äôt provide any analytics on how many watch installs an application has. And unlike the iPad (which they force you to support for life once you have created an iPhone/iPad app) Apple will and does allow you to submit updates to applications without needing to update the watch versions. 

I‚Äôm not saying the Verge hasn‚Äôt changed their tune about the Apple Watch, but Apple as definitely taken a very broadly target device, listened to the market, and made it far more narrowly focused (and I‚Äôm not saying that as a negative). "
5115,"I agree with much of this. That said, the *performance* complaints about the Series 0 were totally valid. And there have been a lot of major UI changes since then that have made the software significantly better.

So I think there some poor execution on Apple‚Äôs part with that first watch, and I‚Äôm not surprised that resulted in some negative reviews. But yes, the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs is for?‚Äù narrative was always pretty silly. It‚Äôs *for* the same thing that it was *for* three years ago. "
5116,"> I love the line about ‚ÄúApple figuring out what the watch is for‚Äù to justify the initial poor reviews the Verge gave the Apple Watch when it first came out.

I don't think this means what most people think it means. Sometimes you put something out and see where it goes. I would almost bet you that if it'd not been taken up by sport-y people and, instead, only CEO's and such -- we'd see a very different Apple Watch.

It's little different from the early stages of smartphones and how they've transitioned to what they are now.

>  It has always been primarily about activity tracking and notifications.

Eh, it's been ""meh"" *at best* for activity tracking relative to all the other devices. It's goal was to be the iPhone of the smartwatches -- a little bit of everything and looked to see where it'd go. Like smartphones you just start throwing things in and see what sticks.

Look Apple doesn't need you to defend them from The Verge. I'm sure they can handle that on their own.

> Complete with awkward staged video to make notifications in the wrist look as bad as possible.

Actually handling some notifications **is** awkward. Try responding to a text on a tram. You'll see how awkwardly difficult it is. This doesn't make it a bad product, like I suspect you're afraid of people claiming, it's just the nature of the product. Certain conditions are very awkward.

You'd do well to remember the iPhone was released after Android and Windows Mobile. There were *many* iterations well before the iPhone and iPod. The Apple Watch, like all other smart watches, are going through this phase. It's a *slow* process that takes years to refine. My modern iPhone has a note taking app that's basically the exact same that Windows 95 had. Does that mean nothing has changed since then? Of course not. Give things time. If in 10 years the Apple Watch doesn't change or hasn't found its spot -- I'll be genuinely surprised but if you think the Apple Watch 10 years from now is going to be heading the same direction the one is now you're fooling yourself and not giving Apple enough credit."
5117,"I completely disagree. The features are all still present on average but Apples development and marketing focus has been around health and fitness. 
The best example I have of this is that whenever I launch the messaging app instead of just opening it launches into one of my unread message threads. If they cared about this function this would be long resolved. "
5118,There is something that could change what the watch is ‚Äúfor.‚Äù If they release it with the teleportation app they teased in the event intro video. The Apple Watch would be an anti-health device at that point with the lack of walking.
5119,"As I recall, The Verge did a total hit-piece on the Series 3 cellular capability last year, taking it out into the ocean where there was hardly any cell signal at all for any device, let alone the watch.  It was totally staged to make the Apple Watch look and perform its very worst -- Verge is basically a stealth click-baiter. "
5120,"I‚Äôm doing the same. It was either $225 or $250 trade in, so about $200 to make the upgrade after taxes. 

The lte is nice to have just in case, but I‚Äôve only used it once since I got the watch, as a test when I first got it."
5121,Where do you trade it in at? Apple?
5122,Exclusive to the 4
5123,No all Series 4 comes with 16gb of storage now.
5124,"Hey, Rizaxy, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
5125,"To be fair, the Verge has kind of reviewed watches/wearable of all kinds over the past year, none still matches up to Apple Watch."
5126,I'm getting the 44mm because with the huge screen I'll be able to work on PowerPoint presentations when the Watch client is released. 
5127,"I believe the 40mm has the same size screen as the 42, but at a higher res doesn't it? So you're not really losing if you had a 42mm before this. "
5128,"Not sure if this will be different, but my husband got me the s2 as a gift and I wanted to exchange the color from silver to gold. Took it into my Apple Store and they said they couldn't do the exchange there, I'd have to ship it back to Apple and exchange that way. "
5129,Same
5130,"At least you get the chance to pick. In many countries we get only non-lte watches, which are sport or nike+ only."
5131,"I really your point, but I doubt there will be non-lte SS versions of the watch from now on. 

Im also on a S0 since just after launch and I‚Äôm definitely upgrading! (although my case is slightly unique in that in addition to the normal woes of the S0, my mic also broke last year rip me)"
5132,"This is my biggest concern. I really dislike the sport finishes, but Apple doesn‚Äôt offer the SS versions where I live anymore because they are LTE only. I‚Äôm pretty pissed about it to be honest because the sports versions look a lot less good and it‚Äôs also a pain in the ass with bands (for example all connectors are Stainless Steel so it doesn‚Äôt look right)."
5133,I have an M Loop with space black Nike+ watch and it looks fantastic. 
5134,That guy is why I have completely abandoned The Verge.
5135,At least we don't have to worry about it not having Dolby Atmos üôÑüôÑ I love to hate Nilay.... Paul is a close 2nd. 
5136,"EXACTLY -- he acts like only one finger is allowed, the pointer finger. I could probably devise 16 different ways to push-to-talk when my other hand has something in it. And even then -- is it really hard to hold a cup in your hand and use a knuckle of that hand to PTT?  Maybe I need to send him a video demonstrating this. "
5137,"I mean you could hold your coffee in the hand with the watch on it, then use your free hand to press the button. Right? The watch doesn't actually stop you from holding something int that hand."
5138,OMG or you could actually set your coffee down!
5139,"Don't even have to set the coffee down, just move it to the other hand."
5140,Staying in a hotel is such a PITA now because I have to walk all around the room flipping switches rather than just yelling at siri. 
5141,"The problem with this ""solution"" is that you are really turning this feature into a one-way phone. Walkie Talkie functionality is defined by a quick back and forth in order to exchange usually essential information such as directions or just checking in quickly.  Anything beyond this, and it makes much more sense to simply make a phone call. "
5142,"There is, in accessibly settings."
5143,Apple Watch app - general - accessibility- scroll down to tap to talk
5144,"Hey now, damnit. I‚Äôm no heathen. I have class...

I do that when I‚Äôm pissing and I need to respond to a text. "
5145,What if your accessibility need is the fact you lost your nose in a frostbite accident? I find your comment incredibly insensitive to the noseless.
5146,It actually seems to work better if you don‚Äôt wait for Siri 
5147,"Man, my S2 was so bad. Not sure what it was and the people at the store checked it, but it could only ever make it past a day if I got lucky. Always felt like I was charging it."
5148,"S4 will be my first Apple Watch. Grabbed a 40mn because of my tiny wrist. The 38mm one on that site is what you‚Äôd grab for the 40mm s4, right?"
5149,"Not sure! i graduated in may and started right after, i have aetna and some other coworkers said they got a deal through them so i looked it up and the past models they give 225 off any one. i get to order them on friday, this week has been way too long"
5150,"I think if your phone connects to a wifi signal then your watch becomes able to connect to the same network, so technically you could also have your watch far away from your phone but near a wifi network you've connected to before."
5151,Overpriced is relative. There is no reasonable alternative if you want to code apps for iOS.
5152,"They are not really that expensive if you compare them to offerings from Microsoft. I have a Surface Pro 4 with the type cover which costed 1250 euros. The chepeast MacBook Pro 13"" is 1390 euros (student discount), and that isn't so bad. I get MacOS, integration with my phone and watch aswell as great optimisation for native apps. However, that's for the 128GB model which is a bit small. The 256GB model suits my needs more, and that costs 1550 euros. Might get the touchbar variant to futureproof it and get som utility from the touchbar in certain programs. That one also has 500+ GB, a 4 core, which total around 1850 euros. Luckily for me, I get ""trustfund"" money every semester."
5153,"Don't buy on price, buy on value.  I just sold a TEN year old macintosh for a couple hundred dollars.  Many Macs are tanks, and its simply astonishing you can get so much use out of them for so long.  Whats cheaper, one $1,500 laptop over 8 years or two?  I always look at total cost of ownership not price."
5154,"If money is an issue I would recommend getting an older model like a certified 2015 or 2016, which could easily save you $1000. The speed differences are negligible and the Touch Bar isn‚Äôt very exciting or useful in my opinion (and this is coming from someone with a 2017 Pro w/Touch Bar)."
5155,"Oh god, I'm stuck in an infinite loop: 

1. Want the 4 but can't afford it. 
2. The 3 is great, has most of the same capabilities and much cheaper, even more so second-hand.
3. If I'm getting the 3, then I may as well get the LTE version. I'd like the LTE version!
4. But then I have to pay more for the phone plan for something I'll probably rarely use.
5. If I'm not going to use LTE, why not get the 4 GPS only? It's much cheaper than the LTE version!
6. But I can't really afford to spend that much to get the 4.
7. So I should probably get the 3....
8. But I really want the 4"
5156,"And activity tracking and notifications are pretty much the same as day one aside from GPS. The focus on what works best may have changed but what the watch does hasn‚Äôt really.

And the apps are still there - and better under Watch OS5. The fashion is still there - even more colours, new bands every season etc

I say this as a day 1 watch owner. Very little has changed about what the watch is ‚Äúfor‚Äù, there has been no revolutionary new feature that changes anything.

People have changed their minds and apple market it differently. The core functionality of the watch hasn‚Äôt changed much at all.

The original verge review criticised the concept, even so far as to staging a video of Nilay having dinner with a friend and being ‚Äúdistracted‚Äù by constant notifications on his wrist to show how bad the concept was.

Yet now the same functionality is amazing apparently. Because Apple ‚Äúfigured it out‚Äù not because Nilay was wrong."

5158,"One of the big reasons why it‚Äôs so successful is *because* they treated it like fashion. They treated it like an actual watch, not a piece of tech. All the different bands and material differences make a big difference to people who wear watches. "
5159,"They even used to have physical retail outlets in luxury jewellery shops around the world. They ended up closing them all.

To be clear, I am agreeing with you :)"
5160,"As another day one watch owner I would say the core capabilities and functions of the watch have barely changed and will barely change when I get my series 4 on Friday.

The marketing has changed, and the focus apple places on things has changed, and people have come around to the concept.

But that is a poor excuse for a review publication. They should not base their reviews on how the thing is marketed, but the product itself. That staged ‚Äúdinner‚Äù video Nilay did of how ‚Äúbad‚Äù notifications on the wrist, as a concept, are should never be forgotten."
5161,"Agree re: performance. Very much looking forward to my upgrade come Friday from a series 0!

My issue with the verge was the initial review complained about the concept and the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs it for‚Äù narrative. They even staged a video of Nilay having dinner and being ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù by notifications on his wrist to demonstrate how ‚Äúbad‚Äù that idea is...

What the watch is ‚Äúfor‚Äù has barely changed at all since series 0, there is nothing to justify claiming that Apple has ‚Äúfigured that out‚Äù thus justifying previous poor reviews for that reason and current good reviews when in reality usage and core functionality (notifications, activity tracking and light apps) has not changed at all."
5162,"What does the marketing of a product have to do with a review?

Reviewers review products. Not marketing campaigns.

I‚Äôm criticising the Verge for implying there has been some fundamental change in functionality.

They straight up said in the original review that the idea of notifications on the wrist was bad, and even staged a faux dinner with Nilay being ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù by notifications on his watch to show how bad it was.

Suddenly this is great? Because Apple ‚Äúfigured it out‚Äù despite it being exactly the same?

This is the criticism. Instead of admitting they got it wrong as they should they‚Äôre pushing a false narrative."

5214,">	I‚Äôm saying that the verge is echoing what Apple is saying

Apple was saying there‚Äôs no point to the watch? That notifications were bad?

So rather than do a real review with any good analysis you‚Äôre saying Nilay 1) echoed apples marketing and 2) criticised the watch for something the Verge now says is awesome despite nothing changing (notifications and function)?

That‚Äôs pretty crappy journalism. Which is my point. Again, a review is a critical analysis of a product. Not a regurgitation of marketing nor making issues where there are none for clicks.

>	I can empathize with that. I think what they were saying though was that notifications on your wrist could pull our attention away from real life even more, despite what Apple was saying which was that this will help you focus on the important things.

Of course the watch also has silent and do not disturb modes if you don‚Äôt want notifications, which wasn‚Äôt mentioned during this section of how ‚Äùbad‚Äù notifications on the wrist were. The attention deficit of the reviewer is an issue with the reviewer not an issue with the product. So basically doing a hit piece on the watch and making it to look as bad as possible on purpose is good journalism?

And the same reviewer gave the Pebble Watch a glowing review raving about how great notifications on the wrist are before the Apple Watch release...

There is a sliver of a point there as you allude to  But not the mountain made out of the molehill, nor the way is was conveyed - staged and ridiculous video making the watch look as bad as possible.

Nilay‚Äôs Apple Watch review is notorious for all the wrong reasons. This was also the review where he criticised the styling of the watch while wearing his awful spiked bracelet, then people mocked him for this fashion choice and he threw a tantrum.

That entire review was one of the low points of the Verge. Click bait, ego centric, poor critical analysis of the product, hypocritical. It was just garbage journalism. It‚Äôs become a meme about ridiculous complaints and got Nilay the reputation he has today.

Dieter does a great job with the series 4 review though."

5238,"I think Apple charges a lot for their devices, but they have been doing a better job about differentiating their product lines. the MBP is for professionals. If you aren't using it to make something or earn money, you probably don't need a Pro.

I think Apple would be well served to sell a mass-market Macbook and I suppose the air is the closest equivalent. Their naming scene right now is confusing because ""Macbook"" is a lot more expensive than ""Macbook Air"" although I guess that makes sense in some strange way.

Either way it sounds like we are on the same page. Apple products are expensive; overpriced would imply there is an alternative/ identical device that is cheaper.

While the average consumer may only need an iPad mini, if they buy a Macbook Pro that doesn't make the MBP overpriced. Rather, it is customers ponying up a premium for an experience full of features that they likely do not need."

Okkkkkkk. in what way?"
5280,[deleted]
5281,"If you install watchOS 7 on Series 7 (makes sense, 7 - 7, right?) you don‚Äôt have that more ram and watchOS 7 isn‚Äôt powerful enough to get fast charging."
5282,"Would have to be price, we‚Äôve been seeing headlines about the thing being abysmal for a few years now

Updates for instance have/had trouble finding any space to install

Other than settling for the cheapest thing, I can‚Äôt find a way to recommend it to anyone"
5283,"I have a series 3. I definitely don‚Äôt think they should be selling it for that price, but honestly mine is completely fine for tracking my runs, workouts, etc.

I have the cellular version though which much have more storage because I‚Äôve never had to do the factory reset to upgrade, etc."
5284,"Because it does everything most people actually want from a smart watch. 

It does not do that very well. 

But it does do it"
5285,It‚Äôs also priced to compete with other cheap watches on the market at a similar price range
5286,It fools a lot of novices. A lot of people who arent tech-literate just see an Apple Watch for $199 and think it's a good deal and buy it. Had a friend and cousin buy it recently.
5287,"Series 3 does fine for activity and sleep tracking, notifications, messages, timers, weather, heart rate, Apple Music, and no-contact bank and credit card functions. It‚Äôs an iPod Nano."
5288,"it‚Äôs still a great no frills fitness tracker that is STILL somehow better than 2021  android wear watches AND fitbits while being cheaper than the both of them

also probably has some good industrial use"
5289,"Because most people with an Apple Watch don‚Äôt use any function besides telling time, and checking messages quickly."
5290,"Honestly the price isn‚Äôt even good considering how old and slow it is.

Should‚Äôve been the SE at that price point."
5291,"It‚Äòs used for up-selling.
You see how cheap the series 3 is, and start thinking about getting one.
Later, you visit the website and see the SE is just a little bit more expensive, and get it instead since you are already sold on the idea of getting an apple watch."
5292,They should just give it away for back to school instead of AirPods if they really have too much inventory to clear for s3
5293,"Entry level device options are the gateway drug for buying more and more expensive devices. In other words you lose money in the short term, you make a ton more in the long term.

5294,"It‚Äôs a great starter watch to see if you re going to like it/use it. It‚Äôs at a good price for a gift, competing with other brands.

Most people do not realise what a smart watch is and how you can use it.

I used to use fitbits until they became too expensive compared to the Apple watch which has instant built in compatibility with your phone."
5295,"No because they consider these to be two different purchasing decisions. Most people who want/can afford the brand new Apple Watch probably won‚Äôt be dissuaded from buying it by cheaper, older hardware. 

By selling the cheaper, older model, they‚Äôre also likely gaining customers who would never consider paying a lot for the brand new Apple watch."
5296,"Kid‚Äôs first Apple Watch. Although, stupidly on my behalf, mine got the SE‚Ä¶"
5297,"I think it‚Äôs because the Series 3 isn‚Äôt really competing against the other Apple Watches.  It‚Äôs competing against the other fitness watches.  When viewed through that lens, the Series 3 does quite a bit for $199 if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs looking for a fitness tracker."
5298,"I have and still use a series 3. It's working good for me and I don't intend to upgrade until next year's new watch models.

I have not had any issues with the 3, including update issues and I got a new iPhone 13 mini and it works fine synced to that.

Apple still promotes it because it is the cheapest entry level watch that they offer. Why wouldn't they promote it? People who want a better model can pay more and get that and people who are looking for the lowest price model can buy the 3.

The 3 is still useful and works fine in my experience. I use mine every day."
5299,I have series 3 waiting next year to upgrade. Only thing hate about the 3 is ever time a update I have to factory reset so it can download new update
5300,It‚Äôs a crappy choice to make the other choices look better in comparison. It also is good to compare and contrast with other models
5301,It doesn‚Äôt even make sense bc it‚Äôs not much cheaper than the SE
5302,It‚Äôs pretty slow on watch os 8 too. Watch os 7.5 was great performance even though the battery life wasn‚Äôt as good.
5303,It‚Äôs a viable option for parents to buy an Apple Watch for their child/children without breaking the bank.
5304,Would very much recommend a series 4 if you can snag one on eBay. I just picked up a S4 Cellular to replace my old S4 GPS and it still works wonders. I got my GF an S6 and can‚Äôt say that I feel like I‚Äôm missing much.
5305,It‚Äôs plausible a lot of the people buying them clearly see it‚Äôs an older device but the price works for them.  They probably have realistic expectations and don‚Äôt use it for more then notifications and fitness tracking. Im sure when Apple can get the Se price down they will finally kill it.
5306,"I have a friend who bought a Series 3 last week. She just wanted the fitness tracking and notifications, so it's perfect for her - and it's nearly half the price of the Series 7. So there's definitely an audience for it. 

I however, just upgraded from Series 4 to Series 7 and am loving it! My wife now has my Series 4 - replacing her Series 2 which she was very happy with."

5308,The updates do not have that problem anymore btw.
5309,"I‚Äôve recently sold mine as I upgraded to a S7, but you are making it sound a lot worse than it is.

The Series 3 can still do all the basics of an Apple Watch, and that‚Äôs all some users want."
5310,I think that‚Äôs the whole point. A $500 fitness tracker doesn‚Äôt sit right with people usually. $200 a lot more in line with cheaper fitbits and other fitness trackers
5311,"The cellular model had 16GB of storage whereas the GPS model was 8GB, iirc."
5312,"It also easier to decide to buy a watch at 200 and then decide to spend just a little more for the much better se. 

Pricing strategy"
5313,"Have they really been fooled? Or is it people paying 3 times as much who are the fools?

People want a smart watch that can count their steps and tell them the time. Series 3 does this and then some

If you don‚Äôt want more from a smart watch why pay more?"
5314,"Honestly I thought the same but knowing that the SE is the standard ""cheaper"" series make me wondering so I looked it up."
5315,And ist maybe also the fact that people who bought it will stick tobapple and invest in a newer and more expensive one. But first thought was literally: apple why
5316,"I like watching tech vids but not tech savvy sometimes. 

Esp not with apple products as an android guy. 

However..... spotted apple watch series 3 on sale black friday for 109 bucks and thought it made a great gift for my folks.

That is a decent price right?"
5317,"I have a series 3. I have put off upgrade after upgrade. 

It‚Äôs hardly fine. It‚Äôs slow, chunky, upgrading it is a whole ordeal. The extra for the SE for a new buyer is 100% the way to go. Save them from the misery."
5318,This is fixed with newer updates.
5319,"Own a Series 3, can confirm. The little thing does everything its supposed to do for me, tracking movement, exercise, sleep, acting as a remote control for music, NFC credit card, maps (much more smoother recently) alarms, notifications etc.

I just love it. I'm sure the new ones are faster but honestly for these use cases it is responsive enough for me. I got it a year ago, just to see if I'll find utility in it, it ended up being more fundamental to me than the phone itself."
5320,"Idk, my GF has a series 3 and constantly has issues on every update.  As soon as the series 7 hits the family and friends store, I‚Äôm buying her one"
5321,"Indeed, Apple worked some kind of magic for watchOS and made it much smoother on the S3. WatchOS 7 was a nightmare for me to install. Ended up keeping my S3 for another cycle, trying to hold out for a redesign."

5324,They fixed updating it recently.
5325,watchOS 8.0.1 improved the performance drastically. It actually was enough to make me put off buying a series 7.
5326,"Couldn't agree with  you more man. I owned the series 3 about 2 years ago, and when I had it it was starting to slow down and become a headache. I can't imagine it now. I don't think its ethical of apple to be selling such a poor performing device."
5327,"Yeah, mine runs like shit even after countless hard resets/wipes and then re-pairing it to my phone. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt buy a S3 today but I don‚Äôt wear it much so I‚Äôm still waiting to upgrade when they add more health sensors. Maybe next year."

What do you mean? Do you mean you‚Äôre not running [WatchOS 8.3 beta 1](https://www.imore.com/how-download-watchos-8-developer-beta)?"
5329,I bought my series 3 shortly after it was released in 2017 and it still works great with no issues. I occasionally want to update but don‚Äôt have enough of a compelling reason to do so. I can even get away with charging it every other day depending on how much I‚Äôm using it.
5330,"Yeah if you just stick to the default Apple apps the series 3 is still very good. I‚Äôve given up using any third party stuff as it‚Äôs so much slower. 

Play/pause/skip is all pretty unresponsive for me in the Overcast app for example but the default music controls are instant."
5331,"I dont know what to tell you, sorry its happening to you but i have a base model which has like 5gb and its working fine for me for a while now."
5332,>	if you don‚Äôt want more
5333,"Exactly in the same boat as you. Patiently waiting for blood glucose or pressure monitoring before upgrading. Other than that series 3 satisfies my current needs, only annoyance is that it takes forever to charge to 100"
5334,[deleted]
5335,"Agreed.  I have the 3, 4 and 7.  3 is so fucking slow it's painful to use."
5336,"Yes, watchOS 8 now has incremental updates like iOS."
5337,For a given value of ‚Äúslow‚Äù. I find my older iPads to be painfully slow in comparison to the latest. Someone who has never used one think they are fast.
5338,"Yeah dude. Honestly you should maybe consider trading in your 3, and get some money for it, while you still can"
5339,"Interesting read! Thanks for sharing. Definitely a more unique use case.

Your comment about ‚Äúscrubbing your run‚Äù got me curious so I checked... The Nike Run Club app has that feature (and I‚Äôm sure others as well). But yeah, it is kind of annoying how minimal the built-in workouts app is."
5340,"I know you don‚Äôt want another app but WorkOutDoors is amazing for some of the things you want and listed above. I literally take the time after every workout to see where my heart rate was high (in correlation to the workout map). What the zone was. Elevation. Etc. it‚Äôs 5.99 once and turned my watch into a data machine. 100% worth it and I never buy paid apps. There are plenty of people who agree if you search for the app and reviews. I was hesitant to buy it, but so happy I did. Recommended to my brother and he loves it as well. Cheers!"
5341,"What made you choose an Apple Watch over, say, a Garmin? You don‚Äôt really seem to be taking advantage of most of what the watch can do, so I‚Äôm curious why you didn‚Äôt get something more specialized to your use case."
5342,AW is very mediocre as a workout watch ‚Äì Garmins are much better
5343,"As for those of you who are saying that it would've been smarter to buy a cheaper, running-focused watch: by and large, you're probably right. However, the point I was trying to make is that my top priority was to have a watch that would be 100 % reliable and headache-free (especially when it comes to GPS and syncing), not getting the best bang for the buck or the most feature-rich running watch per se. 

Personally, I do not feel like I overpaid one cent and am completely happy with my purchase. I understand that most other people probably would not feel this way, but I'm extremely picky with stuff not working as they should (as the Airport Express anecdote, I hope, makes clear)."
5344,"Nice. I think at you‚Äôre case, I can say there are excellent alternatives at cheaper price and high quality. Amazfit watches are excellent these days, or even Huawei. Yes you could use a less than 100$ Amazfit Bip S for that purpose effectively."
5345,A Coros Pace running watch with far longer battery life and priced around $200 would have been a better buy compared to barely using any of the Apple Watch functionality.
5346,"Thanks for this, really useful! I‚Äôm just about to order an SE for just running and workouts. Have you used Strava on the SE?"
5347,Same boat as OP.  I had a series 2 AW but the battery is not lasting even half a day and its freezing up and I mostly use it for working out and running.  I actually picked up a Garmin VivoActive 4 to try out but one thing I didn't realize is that with the Garmin in order to transfer your paid Apple music over to the watch internal storage you have to have a PC/Mac and send it over with itunes and Garmin express.  The fact that I don't own a PC now its all Ipads/Iphones makes it a no-go.  I usually like to run without my phone so I like to have music stored on the watch.  I'm starting to lean now on picking up an Apple watch SE and use it strictly for running/working out like the OP.  The nice thing with the AW if you already have a iphone is how seamlessly it just works.  The garmin is very nice and seems to find GPS quickly but it doesn't quite meet my needs.
5348,"Yeah, the Polar Flow app (which sounds like a meteorological app for tracking the melting of ice-caps but isn't) had this, which is why I more or less assumed Apple's app would, too, I guess. I think Strava's app has this feature as well, not sure though. Not a deal-breaker, more of a would-be-nice-to-have."
5349,WoD is fantastic. I especially like that it maps the run/walk/hike live (even in some cases where I didn't expect it to be able to download a map). Really helpful in unfamiliar areas.
5350,"Thanks for the recommendation. As I said, I'm not currently looking for a third party app but I might try some of them out eventually, so it's good to know what people are using and liking."
5351,"I guess I should've made this more explicit in my original post, sorry about that. The main reasons were my disappointment in the (then highly recommended and well-reviewed) Polar M200 and my implicit trust in Apple as a company. 

I originally considered the then-current Apple Watch (maybe Series 2?) before buying the Polar years ago, but thought that the AW was too expensive, and it would be silly to buy an actual smartwatch just for running, as you're saying. This was a decision I came to immensely regret, as I detailed in my original post.

A relevant anecdote: a couple of years ago I moved to a significantly larger apartment and found myself in need of a Wi-Fi extender/repeater. Apple had just announced that they were discontinuing their Airport line of Wi-Fi routers, including the AirPort Express, which can also be used as a Wi-Fi extender/repeater. The AE was still available through retailers, however, but I decided that it would be crazy to buy a 99 ‚Ç¨ discontinued device with outdated technology and a somewhat poor feature set. After this, I tried out three different extenders from three different companies, which were all cheaper yet ""better"" (specs-wise, on paper) than the Apple device. Not one of them worked reliably or had a decent range. Frustrated, I eventually bought the even-then outdated AirPort Express and have been happy with it ever since. As the clich√©d saying goes, it just works. Theoretically, it might not be the best product for me to get, but it gets the job done, requires absolutely no maintenance and is rock-solid reliable. Same with the Apple Watch SE (at least for now, knock on wood).

So, taking both these things into consideration it was a sort ""fool me once"" situation. This time around I am not regretting my decision, at all, even though I'd be the first to admit that buying an Apple Watch only for running is definitely overkill. I'd much rather buy something a bit too expensive and feature-poor (as a running watch) which is hassle-free and 100 % reliable than mock about with brands I have no experience with."
5352,"Also, I must admit that now that I \_do\_ have the Apple Watch, I do find myself tinkering with it way more than I thought I would. And with the whole pandemic thing going on and the upcoming option to unlock my phone with my Apple Watch instead of my stupid masked-up face, I think I will be wearing the watch for grocery runs and so on."
5353,  Very much agree. Showed me some new running paths near me I never would have known. Plus the ability to download offline maps and create offline routes makes it exceptional if you‚Äôre a hiker as well in areas with no service.
5354,I have the same band and it works fine had it for a few months maybe 4 months now. It‚Äôs my favorite band. Maybe you didn‚Äôt click it all the way.
5355,Mine was fine for 2mo as well.  It was installed as it should have been.  The manufacturer said you should check the band daily to make sure it's secure.  Seems like something you shouldn't have to do....
5356,That shouldn‚Äôt be a concern but i doubt anyone actually checks it.
5357,...which leads me to having a shattered watch.  All I'm saying is buy with caution.
5358,I have very realistic expectations and don‚Äôt expect to be able to use LTE for prolonged activity. I just expect it to let me issue immediate issues. 
5359,"None of the critiques are disqualifying.  I fully expected that this would only let me stay away from my phone for stretches, perhaps a few hours at a time.  Not full days.  While that would be desirable, I‚Äôm not at all surprised at the limitations.

Still looking forward to getting my Series 3 LTE."
5360,Cant read it
5361,"the video in the article was pretty amusing. highly recommend.

and every time that WSJ paywall gets me. I just can't remember that it's coming."
5362,"Wow, the WSJ had something negative to say about an Apple product/service? Surely you jest. I mean, that‚Äôs so unlike them... 

[I just don‚Äôt think](http://quotes.wsj.com/AAPL) that they [would ever really](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/apple-tv-review-a-giant-iphone-for-your-living-room-1446080460) write something [not positive about ](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/iphone-8-review-not-the-upgrade-youre-looking-for-1505818800) an Apple product. [They just have](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/its-a-bad-time-to-buy-an-iphone-1467744006) a great track record [of giving Apple ](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/tim-cooks-bad-apple-1456096265) positive reviews. "
5363,Theverge.com said the same thing about the lte connection being unreliable. Apple better fix this with a software update if possible. 
5364,Now I'm kind of second guessing getting one. The steaming music while running and having the ability to leave my phone behind from time to time was the selling point. 
5365,"If the cellular version of the watch had a camera, I'd be more inclined to leave my iphone behind.  Part of the reason why we have amazing pictures and video of split-second action is because everybody has a camera in their pocket.  Not so much anymore with cellular watches.   "
5366,"The article actually seems overwhelmingly positive, which doesn't jive with the title. Click-bait nonsense."
5367,"this is my first ever apple watch so I‚Äôm not regretting it, but these articles would be pretty unsettling if I was upgrading from a S1 or S2"
5368,Pretty cool video tho. 
5369,"I'll issue a proclamation about the issue with expected issues issuing immediate issues.  

issue? I hardly even know you!"
5370,"Same deal as you, for me the selling point is leave my phone in the car while I work out or for a few hours while I'm away at a theme park. "
5371,Downvoted. Sheesh. This is why WSJ and other tech publications put Apple in the worst light possible. That's their bread and butter 
5372,">There‚Äôs this moment in ‚ÄúDick Tracy‚Äù where the fearless detective, chasing down a villainous gang, taps his magical wristwatch to call for backup. Then, realizing the battery is down to 8% and that cellular isn‚Äôt connecting, he ducks under a desk to find a power outlet and futz with the settings.

>Poor Dick, he upgraded to the cellular version of the Apple Watch Series 3.

>Apple‚Äôs latest has all the ingredients of the future we were promised. Crammed inside that familiar flattened-marshmallow rounded square is the power to make calls from anywhere, connect to an always-listening personal assistant and check in on your health with biometric sensors‚Äîall without depending on an iPhone for connectivity.


>Except, after I spent a week testing these new models‚Äîdenoted by a red dot on their dials‚Äîthe future feels even further away. You‚Äôre lucky if the battery allows you to roam on cellular for longer than half a day‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre making calls. And only a limited number of third-party apps work without the phone close by. (No Instagram, Twitter , Uber.)

>Most worryingly, my colleague Geoffrey Fowler and I experienced cellular connectivity issues on three separate pre-production models, in two different states, on two different 4G LTE carriers.

>On the AT&T -connected models, the cellular connection dropped, calls were often choppy and Siri sometimes failed to connect. On the one that ran on T-Mobile , I experienced several dropped connections.

>When I asked Apple about these issues, a spokesman said, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen this in any of our testing and we‚Äôre looking into it.‚Äù

>That‚Äôs a lot of baggage for a device that costs $400‚Äî$70 more than the noncellular Series 3. And don‚Äôt forget the extra $10 a month you‚Äôll need to pay your carrier for the cellular service.

>A cellular device is, sometimes literally, a lifeline. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt recommend the cellular Apple Watch Series 3 until the connectivity is more reliable. Even then, the battery life could be a buzz kill for some. Apple itself promises only one hour of talk time on LTE, and I confirmed this in my testing. Also, the watch becomes noticeably warm during longer calls.

>However, when the Watch was performing as it should, I discovered the enjoyment of being untethered from my iPhone. In my video I experimented with living a jam-packed day with just a cellular Apple Watch. It isn‚Äôt possible. But there are three types of shorter-lived scenarios where I found it could be useful:

>Workouts. The one thing that has had me yearning for a cellular edition for years is the prospect of finally burying my chunky, smelly iPhone running armband.

>On Saturday morning, with just the Apple Watch on my wrist and AirPods in my ears, I tracked my mile-and-a-half run, texted my wife to ask if she wanted coffee and then paid for two iced lattes at a local shop with Apple Pay . And once Apple‚Äôs streaming music service hits the watch next month, I‚Äôll be able to demand that Siri play ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äôs new single‚Äù or any other song that comes to mind. For now, you still need to download music.

>The same can apply to hiking, biking, golfing‚Äîwhatever your land sport of choice. But depending on how much time you spend out, you may need to turn off the cellular connectivity to conserve battery life. Don‚Äôt expect to stream music or receive motivational texts through a whole marathon.

>New to both the cellular and noncellular versions of the Series 3 are real-time heart-rate reporting and an altimeter. To test both, I decided to conquer my fear of heights and climbed up a 23-foot-high trapeze tower. Apple correctly measured my petrifying walk up the ladder at two flights. (A flight of stairs is 10 feet of elevation gain.) When I reached the top, my heart rate registered 153 beats per minute. Yes, I was that frightened about stepping off the ledge.

>Because I was actively climbing up to that point, I didn‚Äôt receive an elevated heart-rate notification, which it sends when it doesn‚Äôt understand why your heart is racing.

>Water Activities. Confirmed: You can call or text from an Apple Watch while sitting on a Jet Ski in the middle of the Hudson River. Also confirmed: The water is still gross. That experience may sound unusual, but you‚Äôd definitely want a cellular Apple Watch for water activities.

>Whether it be surfing, sailing, kayaking, swimming or sitting in the kiddie pool, the ability to stay reachable without handling a phone, even a water-resistant one, is freeing. Unfortunately, with no camera on the watch, there‚Äôs no way to snap photos.

>The cellular and noncellular versions of the Series 3 are water- resistant up to 50 meters. And no, you can‚Äôt make calls from under water. I‚Äôve tried.

>Walkabouts. Unless you plan to carry around a 5-pound backup battery in your bag, living a full day with just the Apple Watch isn‚Äôt happening. But it can be great for short departures from the iPhone to walk the dog, run to the supermarket, go to a meeting in the office or move the car. In all those situations, I received messages and emails and quickly responded via voice-to-text, which has become more accurate, even in noisy environments. I‚Äôve also been impressed with Siri‚Äôs quick response time to my ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù prompts. I‚Äôm still less than impressed with Siri‚Äôs ability to help.

>One major frustration: If you begin a phone call on your watch with phone connected and then leave the phone behind, the call will drop. Even though it‚Äôs the same phone number, the handoff to the watch‚Äôs cellular isn‚Äôt seamless. I found it generally took a little less than a minute. Apple acknowledges this was typical. When you are in a Wi-Fi area or in proximity to your phone, the watch connects to either of those instead of cellular to save battery.

>If any of these scenarios appeals to you, you should still wait until the cellular experience improves. If you just want an Apple Watch, go for the noncellular Series 3, which still has GPS and runs up to a day and a half on a charge. If you have the previous Series 2, stick with it and just upgrade to Watch OS 4, which gives older Apple Watches the new heart-rate features and workout tracking improvements.

>The Series 3 is the strongest indicator yet of what Apple believes the watch ultimately can be: a stand-alone tiny wrist computer that doesn‚Äôt need your iPhone. But if the Series 3 is any indicator of how that‚Äôs coming along, we should all hold off until, say, Series X."

5374,Their Apple coverage has gotten extremely clickbaitey since Mossberg left.
5375,Wouldn‚Äôt it also be on the carriers end with spotty connection in some areas where their service isnt reliable?
5376,"For fucks sake -  it is very specific and easy to identify issue where the watch connects to WiFi networks without network access, and doesn't failover to LTE in those conditions like its supposed to. Apple has already acknowledged that a fix is forthcoming.

People need to do better research before spouting off at the mouth."
5377,Just be careful of not letting your phone overheat in the summer if you plan on doing that :)
5378,"In most cases, but sometimes it can be a limitation from either software or hardware. "
5379,"Your 100% right, and these idiots are downvoting you for it... makes sense"
5380,"+1, people are so stupid and don‚Äôt even understand the actual glitch before freaking out and offering their ‚Äúexpertise.‚Äù"
5381,This would include corporate guest networks that require a TOS acceptance right?  I had a feeling this would be an issue because my S1 connects but has no internet access. I assumed the S3 would be the same and I‚Äôd get stuck in no mans land.
5382,"No, for fucks sake apple should already had this issue identified and corrected during the beta testing, not a few day after the watches are released. 

I just dropped $700 on a s/s one and I will be pissed if the LTE isnt working.  Its the only reason I bought it"
5383,"Haha won't really have that problem, my phone is used to the Florida heat already :D"
5384,I thought watchOS just ignored networks with captive portals?
5385,"Once it is working properly, you shouldn't run into that. Just like on iPhone, it will ignore those networks if it can't immediately get through to the internet, and resort to LTE."
5386,[deleted]
5387,"It's interesting how many reviewers seem to really want to like the watch, but won't let themselves because it's not a perfectly polished, finely-tuned version 8.4.3 product.

I get the desire for it to be perfect right away, and no one wants to feel like a beta tester, but it's been so long since we've seen a truly original hardware/software platform that people have forgotten just what it takes for a brand new product to smooth out the rough edges.

That said, the things the Watch does well, it does *very, very* well, especially considering how much technology and battery life is packed into such a minuscule device. It also seems pretty clear that many of the problems are going to get solved, the rough edges smoothed, and the software and experience is just going to get better and better over time."
5388,TL;DW?
5389,"yup, I can't stand that guy, he's such a creepy nerd, but his comments are mostly valid in this video. Maybe you're just biased towards apple."
5390,"It's interesting because a LOT of the issues that reviewers are having will be solved with watchOS2.. Since it won't be new hardware yet, I wonder if people will do new reviews or if these are going to be it until the new watch comes
"
5391,"Really good at notifications in exactly the same way that a Pebble is, since it's an Apple product you have a little more granular control over notifications but overall very similar to Pebble and other smartwatches. All of the stuff that isn't notifications/communication is kinda janky. The other stuff it adds is kind of a mixed bag (buggy/slow, non-native apps, but sometimes things work well). Industrial design is really good."
5392,Good question. Some of the reviews were so underinformed (*cough cough* ^Nilay *cough* ^MKBHD) it's amazing they managed to get through a review of version 1.
5393,"Plus, you can read your notifications in imperfect light. Unlike the Pebble. "
5394,"tl;dr ""it's beautiful and the adjustable band is neat but we don't know how to remove it without taking a link out, and it gets smudges so we prefer the sport for its price.""

Wash your hands, for starters, and then slide both sides of the open band off the case simultaneously. 

Can't help you with the price, though. 
"
5395,I love this combo... It's beautiful. 
5396,I wish this watch could be bought without the [$449 band](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MJ5J2/42mm-link-bracelet).
5397,"They spelled ""gray"" two different ways in the SAME sentence lol"
5398,"You don't need to open a link to switch bands. You just have to press the little button on each side of the watch to release both ends of the band at once, then slide out in unison. "
5399,How do you do it simultaneously?
5400,"True, but it's easier to just undo a link then take both out, and I wouldn't want to risk damaging a $500 band "
5401,It's much easier to detach a link and take them out separately.
5402,"I'm dumb and don't get it. What do you mean ""at once""? I have a space black and I can't do both sides at the same time... At least I don't think I can. "
5403,"Unlock the clasp, and you can then maneuver both ends of the band out of the watch. There is enough wiggle room.

Source: my watch"
5404,"Press one side, slide it 2mm so it stays unlocked; press the other side to release it, too; slide both out. 

Someone posted a picture of themselves wearing the watch this way just today. "
5405,I don't think it's easier; undoing the links is a hassle sometimes. I always just unclasp it and wiggle it out. It doesn't bend it.
5406,[deleted]
5407,"So you press the button on the back of the watch to release one side of the band. But don‚Äôt take it out, just slide it over a for mm so it doesn‚Äôt auto lock again. Then do it to the other side. Now both are unlocked and you take both out at the same time from the watch body. 

That is what he means. "
5408,Be careful with this. I scratched my SB around the edges where the link band connects to the watch this way. I would strongly advise disconnecting the link first before removing the band so you don't suffer the same fate as I did! Just waiting for a bit more damage before claiming an accidental damage repair on AC+
5409,I agree. The proper way to do it is to unlatch the link and take off one at a time. That's how I was shown at the Apple Store. 
5410,"I will keep that in mind, thanks"
5411,"""Been playing with it. Yes it‚Äôs an improvement but no where near Apple Watch.""

I wonder what can you do on the Apple Watch that makes it ""no where near""."
5412,"The problem with the Smartwatch market is that nobody is asking the right questions. It's 2021, where is the serious competition to the Pebble?"
5413,Who is that guy and why should I care what he thinks?
5414,Read DYNALogix's review. Top of this website....
5415,"I used to have apple watch envy.  The biggest issue with android wear/wearOS used to be general UI performance; wear2100 and sub-1gb RAM experience was absolutely dreadful.  Now we have exynos, wear4100, and performance has been excellent.  My apple watch envy is gone.  My experience from using a galaxy watch active 2, or a ticwatch pro 3/wear4100 SOC watch, I don't really care anymore.

Performance of both of those watches in my hands has been great.  My watch lets me interact with my phone notifications, take calls, etc.  Set alarms and timers, record my activity and health metrics.  I used to think that on-watch ECG was an important feature, but then having used it, it really doesn't tell you much of anything unless you're having an emergency, in which case I'd be calling 911 anyway."
5416,"Honestly I always said I like wear os. It is flawed and I say it to people alot who defend it too much. Sometimes it works great some times it's a mess. In honestly though as a smart watch it does everything you need. Where Apple has had the edge is in its fitness. I don't like Samsung health or alot of things about fit. But they are narrowing the gap 

But for me Garmin does the fitness spot on and the battery life is nice. That's why I wear my Garmin for working out and day to day. And a as wear for when I'm just going on days out or dress up and that is something apple sucks at. Every watch is just a mini looking I phone on your wrist. 

Also as a side people moan about wear battery  but that's just par for the coarse with smartwatches and wear has improved with battery so it's still up there with apple on that."
5417,"The whole ""doesn't run like an Apple Watch"" thing is such a BS. I can't even listen to it anymore. Just admit that you're a goddamned Apple fanboy, get yourself an Apple Watch, and stop making retarded, biased comments that serve no one. Jesus."
5418,"Apple watch is WORSE than any Wear OS watch on Android. You literally cannot pair an Apple Watch to an Android phone. You literally will have ZERO features of your smartwatch if you try to use an Apple Watch with an Android Phone. That is LITERALLY WORSE than the Galaxy Watch 4 running on any Android phone, not just Samsung phones.

Are you telling me that in order to have a good smartwatch I have to change my entire phone ecosystem and throw away thousands of dollars in app purchases to start over. Sorry but no there's no comparison here until Apple decides to pull out of its walled garden approach. And that will happen never.

It's 2021, why can't such a SMART watch like the Apple Watch connect to an Android phone, and provide some actual competition?"
5419,"Someone fell over, hit their and became a delusional idiot."
5420,"Man like we need competiion 

We need google to come and say, we have this plan for wear os 3.0


What oem can do 
What apps can they make 
What will be the user exp on non samsug watches
What google assistent  improvement will they make 

What will they do with the Fitbit aquisition 

Things like that ü§†"
5421,"The Apple watch has some very cool and probably more polished features, but imo it remains beatable until they can make one that last more than a day with regular use. I enjoyed the health app, but it was really lame i couldn't track my sleep when i tried it out cause i would die on my before bed time."
5422,"It's called a ""fitbit.""  Apple watch is a joke with its 14hr battery"
5423,"The serious competition is every standalone device, full stop. I'm still waiting on a serious Apple Watch."
5424,"Biggest thing is smoothness and fluidity of the OS. Like, it doesn't feel like a pentium 4 trying to run crysis remastered. And the ecosystem and the apple health is much more polished and professional looking than samsung health, which has ads for tiktok on top in their app. Also apple health actually tells you a lot of very useful things about your health and tips to improve it throughout the day. Samsung health kinda has some features like this, but feels all very basic after using the apple watch.

Source: have a watch 3 myself and a apple watch 4 from my gf. Tried both. Watch 3 freezes and stutters on everything. Galaxy Watch 4 seems much smoother on review videos, but still seems to stutter on some animations. UI and watchfaces still don't seem to be as polished as apple watch counterpart. I'm a full Android user but I admit that still, in 2021, no one can make a real apple watch killer yet. The galaxy watch 4 is great, but the apple watch series 6 is better. And the series 7 is around the corner already.

Edit: as one of the answer to my comment pointed out, maybe sometimes it's actually better to have a slightly less powerful cpu but 2-4 days of battery life like my galaxy watch 3 has. My gf's apple watch only lasts a single day, and she barely uses it. Putting things into this perspective maybe it's not so bad to have a slower cpu but 4x the battery life on my watch. But the lack of polished software still stands as a huge barrier"
5425,"Like you have an ecosystem 

Bands, 
Real apps 
Awesome watchface 
Sensors
And the just works  thing"

5428,He is a software developer and the first Wear 3.0 GW4 user to accurately tell what the GW4 can and cannot do for the many Reddit readers who want to know the truth. All the online articles for the GW4 were crap. Written by people who really don't have a clue on what smartwatch users really want to know when a new watch is released.
5429,Give me a Fenix 6 with WearOS and 7 day battery life and I'm sold
5430,Apple watch is great hardware and software and so very mugly in design.  I cannot wrap my head around how Apple has convinced people otherwise.  I could never imagine wearing it in any professional setting.
5431,"Sounds like someone who's not seen an apple watch in use irl. The voice assistant works (and is fast), the software design is actually modern instead of feeling like a reskinned version of Android 4.4, and everything is *fluid*. Both of my parents have apple watches and love them.

The only reason I don't have an apple watch is because I don't have an iPhone (not fond of iOS)."

5435,"IMO the ticwatch pro 3 is the current ideal smartwatch, I think the dual display tech should be introduced by waaay more people, that combined with its super low power essential mode schedule mode so i can put it to deep sleep at night i get 3 days of battery between charges AND a fluid experience. ONLY thing it's missing is a rotating bezel"
5436,">ave a watch 3 myself and a apple watch 4 from my gf. Tried both. Watch 3 freezes and stutters on everything. Watch 4 seems much smoother on review videos, but still seems to stutter on some animations. UI and watchfaces still don't seem to be as polished as apple watch counterpart. I'm a full Android user but I admit that still, in 2021, no one can make a real apple watch killer yet. The watch 4 is great, but the watch series 6 is better. And the series 7 is around the corner already.

You're spot on about the Ads cheapening Samsung's experience. Samsung also make bad UIs. You'll get hate for it on this sub, but it's true. There are always weird little issues.

Re: the smoothness - I'm actually happy with the smoothness of my Ticwatch Pro 3. I'd rather this level of smoothness and 3.5 days of batteyr life over an Apple watch that is smooth as butter but only lasts a day."
5437,"I had a Gear Sport and a Galaxy Watch OG 46mm before jumping ship. I didn't use health measurements but I didn't had OS freezes. The OS ran well and the GW4 is smoother than the GW3, yes, but it is expected if you compare a 2018 SoC to a 2021 one."
5438,"4100s run Wear OS with perfect fluidity. Never used Samsung health, and that's hardly the only option."
5439,They didn't even had offline Spotify until a few months ago. I had that years ago in the Gear Sport.
5440,"> Bands

Really? Sorry that makes you sound a bit fanboyish. There are way way more bands with the standard lugs 18, 20, 22 mm system that all kinds of wrist watches have been using for decades if not longer than there are Apple Watch specific bands.

And Apple's system has two advantages over standard quick release bands, other than locking you into an ecosystem. 

> Awesome watchface

Same as above. We can design our own watchfaces with multiple very powerful apps, including all kinds of fluid full screen animation, complications and such. The Playstore as well as those watchfaces designers are full of very quality watchfaces. This is again a clear advantage for Wear OS.

> Sensors

Samsung has beat Apple this year in this regard, at least on Samsung phones.

.

App ecosystem and sadly thanks to Google's negligence the it just works part I agree with of course."
5441,And where can I find his hot takes on GW4? I skimmed his Twitter account and YT account and no content where I would find out what the GW4 can and can't do. There's only a 9-minutes YT unboxing video of all Galaxy Unpacked 2021 devices which I doubt would go in-depth.
5442,"That guy on Twitter? His profile says he is a ""Tech + Lifestyle YouTuber, Content Creator and Educator"".

You mean the Bubble Cloud Launcher developer DYNAlogic and I agree with what you said 100%."
5443,"To be fair, all I want is a fenix with Google assistant so I can reply to messages and ask a question quick."

5445,It seriously looks like it's for children
5446,"I don't understand how the Apple Watch doesn't get significantly more shit for the less than 24 hours rated battery life.. I could not use a watch that I have to charge multiple times a day, that's just such a deal breaker to me. I love that with my ticwatch I can look at the battery, see 30% left, and know that's enough for my full day use"
5447,"Sure mate, whatever you say. Typical ""criticizing apple? Must've never used it""."
5448,"I'm currently using an apple watch and I use it daily, faithfully, from controlling homekit and everything else. For me the apple watch wins with 3rd party app support, some fitness features, and voice assistant. Everything else I would definitely give to galaxy watches simply because it's the only other smart watch I've used besides the apple watch. The AW has it's issues as well. It's absolutely crazy when you're trying to use the watch and a notification comes through and just says fuck whatever you were doing and have to reload when you swipe away the notification. When you delete messages from your iphone, you have to delete them again off the watch, one by one. Yes it has more app support but a lot of the times I end up pulling out my phone because the app simply takes too long to load on the watch(series 6). But it does a lot of things well just like the galaxy watches. I think the big difference we see in apple watches and other watches is simply due to the fact that there are a shit load more of ppl using iPhone than any other phones. They are EVERYWHERE"
5449,"My gf, brother and his fiance have apple watches and I don't see what is so special. They just use it to check texts, my gf tracks sleep, and that's about it. I use my fossil for going on runs/hikes, sleep tracking, heart rate monitor when I stream scary games, Google assistant, and Spotify control. 

I don't know much about gw4 but from my experience my gf thinks I get more use out of my watch than her."
5450,"Yeah, then I stuck them into your mum's ass. She likes it."
5451,"Right, it sounds so simple. Just make the goddamned best OS and best SOC that has ever been created. What could go wrong? HMMMMMM...."
5452,Google have many jobs. That's not how you use that phrase.
5453,"That's GENEROUS. Former usage.

Claims more than twenty-four hours, rarely survives more than 12. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and bumped it up by 2 hours"
5454,"How Samsung thought the notification card interaction prior to the watch 4 was a good idea, I will never know.  It's completely inverted to the normal interaction method on phones and really just sucks in general.  It's the only thing I really didn't like on my active 2 (and also not having gesture keyboard typing; though T9 was easy enough to use, for an old fart like me who grew up with it)."
5455,"Ok yea true that's a real downside, apple watch is extremely smooth because maybe it has a ""too powerful"" cpu, my gf has to charge it everyday and my galaxy watch 3 lasts 3-4 days. Putting things into that perspective, maybe I'm actually fine with having a less powerful cpu but 4 days of battery more than a powerful and smooth cpu with half a day of battery"
5456," wear os google music 

Ah it's dead,
Yt music  comes only to samsung watches 

Spotify it's a very slow rollout :("
5457,Well apple watch has apple music
5458,"As someone using both, the watch faces still in no way compare to apples. They may be more customizable, but the information density + still good design of apple watch has not been beaten by a single other I've seen yet.

5459,Well i am kinda new here but what apps do you use for fluid animation and watch faces who just work ?.
5460,"Are you blind. His review is at the top of this website with 177 positives and 192 comments...

And read down to the questions asked..... Here is what I learned on the GW4 and compared it to my Fossil made smartwatches:

The GW4 watch itself has Good looking design, good speed, good vibration motor and uses a Galaxy app with many features.

The GW4 is limited in the amount usable wear apps available now and you   
can not use the galaxy store for downloads. Wear 3.0 doesn't run TIZEN   
apps/ watch faces.

The battery life is 24+ which is what I get and more on my fossil made watches.

Wireless charging is convenient using a Samsung phone but slow. Fossil watches have a built in quick charge. (80% in 50 minutes)"
5461,I'd ask for a working Assistant first before adding it to anything else.
5462,[deleted]
5463,I'm really trying to be nice about it but WearOS is still years behind what apple has done with the apple watch and it's disappointing to see them continually stumble. I don't have any apple devices but it's clear the watches are very good. I want WearOS to get better and it's only through comparison that we can know what needs improvement.
5464,Booooo. Try again
5465,Well android is great what has stopped google to make the same for wear os ?

It's not like iOS / watchOS has no slow 3rd party app rollout..."
5471,"Watchface maker for me where I made my own personal watchface. There is no watchface on the Apple Watch that you can't recreate in it and then some. In fact the Apple Watch lacks the option for end users to create their own watchfaces completely. 

There is also a website somewhere that collects user made watch faces. Arguably there are already a ton of watch faces simply on the Play Store."
5472,None of these seem like deal breakers
5473,Are you implying that /u/DYNALogix is that twitter guy EMKWAN? I don't believe this.

5475,"For me, with the latest watches (especially TWP3) i think wearos has caught up to the point where it's now about tradeoffs, Apple Watch is clearly superior in hardware quality and software integration, but WearOS offers better battery, more customizations, and a better aesthetic (subjective opinion obviously), plus I think the UI of WearOS, while not always better, has some places that definitely is better"

5480,"I‚Äôve had the series 0, 3, 4, 5 and now the series 6. None of them have lasted 2 days ever. The longest they have ever lasted is 1.5 days. That is on a non work day. When I‚Äôve basically stayed at home all day and spent most the day sitting down. I could wear it to bed but can‚Äôt do sleep tracking. In that scenario it can last 1.5 days. 

As for lasting 12 hours. I‚Äôve had that many times. Depending on how active I am. If I take my watch off the charger at 6.30 am. Do a 35 minute walk to work and I‚Äôm moderately active then by 7 pm I get the low battery warning. If I was more active and did a lot of work ours it wouldn‚Äôt last long at all.

5494,"What exactly is behind Apple's Watch?
Recent reviews of Galaxy Watch praise the Bixby assistant. What's the problem then?"
5495,"Never used a wear OS watch. I have used the galaxy watch and watch active 2. I wouldn‚Äôt say the watch active 2 was years behind my Apple Watch series 6. 

The active 2 was fluid and fast enough. 

Bixby wasn‚Äôt great on the watch but I downloaded a third party Google assistant app. It worked well enough. I would hope that the Google assistant comes to the watch 4 in time. 

Samsung have more watch faces but Apple‚Äôs watch faces have better complications. For example on the watch face I have now I have 2 pictures of my children, a complication to control my Apple TV and a complication to control playback on my homepods. I didn‚Äôt see an option for that on the Samsung watch. The complications were largely determined by the watch face developer. On the Apple Watch you can basically have a complication for any app you have installed on the watch. However what I will say is that the complications had improved from the galaxy watch to the active 2. It had a lot of basic complications like fitness, health measurements, time, weather, date etc 

In terms of health sensors the watch 4 is now ahead of the Apple Watch. It can do pulse, o2 saturation, ECG, blood pressure and BIA. 

Samsung pay works well enough. Notifications came through as expected.

Native sleep tracking was better on the Samsung watch. Although I‚Äôm using a very good third party one on the Apple Watch. 


I think it comes down to how you use your watch. 

I use mine for notifications, very light fitness tracking, setting reminders, sleep tracking, flashlight, responding to messages, triaging phone calls, Apple Pay. 

Most of this I could do on a Samsung watch. The things the Samsung watch doesn‚Äôt do that I also use on my Apple Watch is:

Being able to control my Apple TV‚Äôs from my watch 

Being able to control my homepods from my watch. 

As far as I know there is no way at present to control a chromecast or Google home speakers from a Samsung watch. However this might change now that it runs wear OS. 

I personally don‚Äôt use music playback on my Apple Watch. However this is better on the Apple Watch. It also had more space for off line storage and you can also store audiobooks and podcasts. 

If you‚Äôre big into fitness which I am not lol then fitness + is superior as it links in with your Apple Watch as you are doing workouts and gives you real time feedback on your Apple TV. 

So yes the Apple Watch is more polished but for basics the Samsung watch is more than capable."
5496,"So you've got two daddies, don't you? Poor you. Have you been bullied?"
5497,">zen? From what I've seen, there are tons of third-party watch face options on Wear OS.

i've always used wear os and I got a galaxy watch active a few months ago and I HATED the watch faces. ALL third party watch faces can only be customized by tapping on the watchface and when you switch them to another you lose everything. A lot of developers also have a ton of different watchfaces just because it's easier to build multiple variations than customizing a single one."
5498,I have a series 6 44mm and have to charge it every 40 hours with everything on and around 50 if I disable raise to wake so yeah apples numbers are bullshit

AOD is so nice because you don't have to worry about flailing your wrist like a maniac to get it to turn on and display basic info like time and steps, and I think the ticwatch implementation is the gold standard"
5503,"The Samsung watch doesn‚Äôt need to improve on much. 

The main things for me are getting the google assistant on the watch and text input to replay to messages.

App support didn‚Äôt bother me much but having access to the play store would fix that.

Even the active 2 was very useable for me. The things that the Apple Watch does better than current Tizen watches like music playback are not things that I use or would use. I don‚Äôt go out running and even though I have a cellular Apple Watch I have my iPhone with me 99.9% of the time. 

It‚Äôs not anywhere near as bad as the reviewers make out. It does things that the Apple Watch doesn‚Äôt do which I want like blood pressure monitoring."

5513,"I haven‚Äôt used sleep cycle as I refuse to pay for subscription models on apps like that. AutoSleep has been absolutely incredible. One simple charge and the data is incredible. It takes a bit for the tracker to properly understand your sleep cycles but after about two weeks it nailed the smart alarm every single day which has been amazing for my energy in the days. I thought I couldn‚Äôt find another comparable app after switching from android and having used sleep as android for years, but AutoSleep is just as good if not better. 

I‚Äôve used auto wake a bit. I never really found it to work so I don‚Äôt count on it to make my alarms. I simply have a complication on my watch face for AutoSleep and I set the alarm as needed. Don‚Äôt particularly see the need for the second app."
5514,"AutoSleep! It‚Äôs a terrific app, a single one time cost of about $5 US, no recurring subscription, the data is yours and only yours (no data is collected), the updates are frequent, and the user guide and tech support are outstanding. In fact it turns out a large number of medical staff at my hospital use it, including those in the sleep clinic. I do use the Smart Alarm in AutoSleep (albeit with a backup phone alarm as one of the medications I take is on an extremely tight schedule). 

FYI, Sleep Cycle is a subscription service, your privacy is nonexistent, and it links the following data directly to you: Health and Fitness (probably all of it because somehow they absolutely need to know your exact daily intake of selenium in order to provide a sleep app), your location (Does it matter exactly where you‚Äôre sleeping or do they have a side gig as a private deceive service?), Identifiers (I‚Äôve yet to figure that one out as it‚Äôs so nebulous) Purchases, Contact Info, and Usage Data (which probably includes every detail  of your sleep and may include far more about your watch and phone in general). 

Please the privacy policies of every app you‚Äôre considering downloading and decide who should have unfettered access to some or all of your personal data. At a minimum, make them work for it instead of paying them for the privilege of having access to it all!

Edit: Sleep Watch links your health and fitness data and user content to you (is user content everything on your phone and watch or just all the details of your sleep?)."
5515,"I was using and bought the paid subscription for Sleep Cycle. However it performed terribly for me. There were days when I would forget to turn on the sleep timings so it could do it‚Äôs job. Then i made sure to turn in on every night and then they pushed an update or something and the app would randomly miss days even though I had started and ended the sleep timings so the UI is great but functionality doesn‚Äôt work for it. 

Somewhere along the way I came across SleepWatch and it has a free version that tracks it all for me. I don‚Äôt need to activate anything at all and it never misses. The best part is that even If i spent 2 hours sleeping, then woke up and slept again after 3 hours. It was able to capture that I slept at that time. If at any time it didn‚Äôt, i can manually add that sleep time and it will sync the data and tell me how much I spent in light/deep sleep and when was I awake. So I‚Äôd recommend SleepWatch. No idea about those other apps."
5516,"I have both AutoSleep and AutoWake. I really disliked AutoWake, especially when it began calling out ‚Äúwakey, wakey‚Äù at 2 pm from my phone. At first I was trying to figure out who was even talking. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

AutoSleep has been great, reliable, already has an alarm available built in, and gives me solid information on what happened during the night, including sleep levels, heart rates and oxygen saturation. It may not be approved to diagnose sleep apnea, but it does show my oxygen levels are all ok (usually fall during sleep apnea) heart rate appropriate for my sleep levels, and a good idea of light sleep, still sleep, and deep sleep. The respiratory rate isn‚Äôt directly measured, but is extrapolated from the data it has to work with. 

It will also show me get up during the night if I use the bathroom, but doesn‚Äôt get fooled I just woke up early. It will assume I‚Äôm awake if I start using my phone if I woke up before the alarm. For $5 one time fee (I really, really prefer that to subscriptions) I think it‚Äôs a very decent piece of software."
5517,"I used both (AutoSleep and Sleep Cycle) and even Pillow for a few months. 

AutoSleep is a great app with a crappy and outdated UI. If you just want to track your sleep, it could become a challenge to dive through all the data this apps is throwing at you. I appreciate the smart alarm feature of AutoSleep a lot. From time to time, AutoSleep needed a recalibration (messed up the sleep data) - this is something that was driving me nuts and never happend with any other app. 

Sleep Cycle is a cool app with a clean and focused UI. I like it a lot. Sleep data is also most likely very accurate, it‚Äôs considered as best sleep record app on iOS / Apple Watch. The smart alarm feature is also outstanding. I only wished it would be possible to track sleep without needing to set a alarm. The trend feature of Sleep Cycle is much better than for AutoSleep which only shows a few days history."
5518,"What do you mean that AutoWake didn‚Äôt work? 

There appears to be a functionality where it‚Äôll wake you up after it clears your sleep debt. That seems interesting. 

Do these apps work while in Sleep Mode on the Apple Watch?"
5519,"What focus mode works best while using it? Do you put your Apple Watch in Sleep Focus, or Do Not Disturb, or does AutoSleep silence notifications when you put the app in Lights Out?"
5520,">	Sleep Cycle is a subscription service, your privacy is nonexistent

This is simply not true. You can disable any option to store data outside of your device. So it offers the same privacy as AutoSleep."
5521,"From my experience it failed to automate the alarm setting process. It kinda just did nothing in the background. The new features sound super cool but I haven‚Äôt had much success with them. Maybe I‚Äôm doing it wrong?

And yeah, sleep mode hasn‚Äôt gotten in the way for me honesty!"
5522,"AutoWake is BS as built, the alarms are completely unreliable. It's also not currently working due to a bug in 15.4."
5523,"I put my watch always in sleep mode, regardless which sleep tracking app I use. It works like a charme, also with alarms."
5524,"Did not know that, thanks!"
5525,"If that‚Äôs the case, I wish they‚Äôd put the smarter alarms into AutoSleep. I‚Äôd really like to use an alarm that wakes me up when I‚Äôm no longer in sleep debt. 

Have you compared AutoSleep to Sleep Cycle by chance?"
5526,"You mean take out the malfunctioning bits (which is all the app) and put it in another app. AutoWake makes so many assumptions about sleep debt along with other features it just doesn't work reliably, has never worked reliably, and will never work reliably. Don't use it (you can't right now anyway), you're putting your trust in it that it will wake you up, it will fail. You'll get three days of proper alarms to the point where you think ""ah, those guys on Reddit were wrong"" then it'll stop and never work again. And right now the dev is trying to cook up a fix for the bug. No thank you."

You do, but is not worth the time the discussion.

Nice watch face, sucks that it does not give athlete metrics for the price"
5530,Off topic.. but wanted to get your opinion on Athlytic pro. Is it worth the subscription? How would you rate it compared to Training Today?
5531,"The Buddywatch link should include all the apps.

5532,"All but one complication are a one-time purchase which total less than $20 CAD (so maybe $15 USD?). The one subscription is $20/year CAD. The data exists in Apple Health, if you don‚Äôt like the way I‚Äôve extracted it there are lots of other options. 

Compared to the cost difference for a sports watch with decent recovery metrics the Apple Watch + a handful of third-party apps is still cheaper, and is a viable option for people who have/want a Watch instead of something like a Fenix or Vantage V."
5533,"Training Today updates throughout the day with the latest HRV reading, while Athlytic (by default) prefers sleep HRV (similar to the way Polar and Whoop assess recovery ‚Äî we don‚Äôt have to talk about the dogshit heart rate sensor on the Whoop). 

Personally I wouldn‚Äôt subscribe to Athlytic (I did for a month and didn‚Äôt renew). The recovery info is free, and I tend to get my exertion/training load from Polar."
5534,I don‚Äôt see a buddywatch link‚Ä¶
5535,"The problem with people stating it is still cheaper to pay 3+ apps to get good metrics out of it, is with all possible respect stupid.

All the data is there, you need to make sense of it anyways, you know why people prefer a good all around metric?

So they don‚Äôt have to make sense of all the things involved to get such metric.

I know for a fact that any sport watches use resting HR, HRV and some sort of extra calculated strain, whether it is time spent in 4+ HR zones, or HRV decline through the day, you can try and built something even in the shortcuts, but without the science behind it, like polar, garmin, sunto, and so many other options.

It does not make sense, you will lack most of the science behind them, and more likely even the context.

So yeah, Apple Watch does not compare by any means.

Sports oriented devices are not that much expensive, AW costs almost the same as some of the top end forerunner, or vantage line up, those will have software support for at least 2-3 active years, and most of those devices will last 4 years without any issues.

Does that make AW a bad device?

Not by any means, in fact AW since series 4 are the best Wrist HR based devices out there, matching almost perfectly a Polar H10, the fact that they don‚Äôt give you any useful metrics just sucks, they have the data, and its accurate to a 98+% when compared against a chest strap .

The fact that you have a lot of apps that claim to give you those useful metrics without any scientific background just makes the point worse. 

The watchface you shared is a living example of that, with the same data Athlytic app is telling me that im ready to go all in, but the training today is telling me, listen if you go higher than HR zone 3 you‚Äôre gonna be fucked up...

That is the problem, having options is not having quality options"
5536,Thanks. Is it worth subscribing if I had no other source for exertion/workout detailed effort metrics?
5537,Is there any other app that give you the exertion/training load without a subscription fee?
5538,It's in the photo caption. Might not be easy to find on mobile. https://web.buddywatch.app/buddy/agentnox
5539,"You seem to have jumped to a few incorrect assumptions, so let me clarify. 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm completely device agnostic. Currently wearing Apple Watch 6 (and 4 if the 6 is charging) and a Polar Grit X. Adding Garmin 955 assuming my hunch is right and it‚Äôs announced in a few weeks. 

‚Ä¢ I never said the Watch is better than, or on par with, a top end dedicated sports watch. But it‚Äôs better than people who review it based only on default apps/software give it credit for. Since this sub is an Apple Watch sub it seems appropriate to restrict my discussion/posts to that device. 

‚Ä¢ The watchfaces as pictured in this post are using generic sample data in complications, so commenting on discrepancies between non-existent data is a waste of your time. 

‚Ä¢  Neither of us are in a position to claim whether or not these apps incorporate peer-reviewed science in how they analyze the raw health data. I can say that when testing Training Today vs Garmin‚Äôs Body Battery (using an old Vivoactive 4, so admittedly not the best oHRM) for a month the two were consistently in agreement. I probably should take a month to correlate the watch apps vs Polar‚Äôs ANS recovery score but since leaving academia I‚Äôm way less passionate about random poking at data. 

I appreciate how much you seem to care about wearables and quantified self data."
5540,"I have a subscription and I think it's totally worth it. I'd prefer to have all my recovery and exertion data from one source for more accuracy, but it also has many other features such as sleep data and the company is constantly updating the app. The latest update included a sleep debt that I thought was pretty cool. They also recently added coaching where it analyzes your recovery and exertion trends and gives you advice on how hard to push it.  It's pretty much whoop for the apple watch but with better accuracy and a wayyyyy lower price."
5541,Not that I‚Äôve come across
5542,"You are also making a few incorrect assumptions which only denote the lack of reading comprehension...

Which device you actually use or not, wasn‚Äôt even in the table, I don‚Äôt care, Im personally talking by experience having a vantage m, having used a forerunner before, having and AW S5 the h10 chest strap and a Watch Fit from huawei .

And yes, at least on my side, I am on a position to talk about them having nothing really medically proven to back up all the metrics.

If they actually did, they will state that in either the app publication, somewhere in the application, or in the about sections. 

But they don‚Äôt do that, because they have none of it.

Huawei watch fit actually has explanations all over the device and app of the metrics they backed up against health institutions, and which ones they use based In well reputable organization like World Health Organization.

Again stating that you have even hundreds of apps that provide you with metrics, means nothing when they can not be useful, my strongest point remains, at that point in time i had watched 2 apps targeted for the same thing, knowing how hard can I go today one  was giving me indications to go all in, one did warned I was pretty much overtraining, with the same data, now that I hace took a look at the third, and again very different results from the other 2 telling me that my training is pretty much useless.

my claim of data discrepancy is based on my actual data using the watch face you provided, and I have been having this behavior before, none of the companies behind this apps are really health specialists, neither do they have any approval to back up their metrics, 
On the watch that is on my wrist right now where i downloaded the watch-faces and apps you provided, one app metric is telling me that im ready to go all in and the other that I should not work anything above HR zone 3.

If that also helps I am a software engineer myself, currently specializing myself into data science after 5+ years as a developer, so having the background I can assure the lack of quality on the apps when they behave like stated before.

All the prior mentioned brands have scientific testing and studies going on, with dedicated scientists into their metrics development.
Apple Watch and 99% of the apps targeted to it, do not have that. 

I respect you and your opinion, but feelings have nothing to do with reality and facts.

And the fact is that AW is reviewed on stock software for that kind of reasons.

They have been proveed over and over again, even on specific subjects, ‚Äúthe quantified scientist‚Äù YouTube channel has analyzed a few sleep tracking apps with the Apple Watch and they all came up with very different results if you want to see it for yourself thats what I mean by having apps means nothing if they don‚Äôt give useful metrics or information"
5543,Isn't this just recycled old news lol.
5544,"Battery life, bigger screen and new design would be good enough reason for me to upgrade from the 5 series."
5545,Looking for an upgrade from Apple Watch 3. Will buy 7 if the price is right
5546,I‚Äôm hoping the series 7 is the standout product this year but from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs probably going to be 2-3 more years until we‚Äôre really seeing some groundbreaking stuff in terms of the medical side of things.
5547,I know this mostly goes against what everyone on reddit wants but I‚Äôm really hopping that this is the thinnest Apple Watch ever by at least 1mm
5548,Really hope the battery life is improved a lot
5549,I‚Äôve had the 5 for about a year and 3 months. I don‚Äôt plan on upgrading anytime soon but I do have insulin resistance so the glucose meter would help. If it ever comes out then I will upgrade!
5550,I‚Äôm still using a series 0 watch and will upgrade to this one. Feels about time.
5551,All I want to see is the new faces üò©
5552,Finally upgrading from my series 4- most of the upgrades from the 5/6 weren‚Äôt big enough sells to upgrade. At this point I‚Äôm not really concerned with new features and just want a new watch
5553,"And its going to be the best one weve ever made.
Im sure youll love it"

I may be waiting for forever, but I‚Äôm hoping Apple gets there eventually."

5563,S4 user here. This is the upgrade to get.
5564,"Damn i'm still holding onto my series 0! Keep debating upgrading but they haven't really seemed all that different to me. Telling time, timing runs and getting texts really seems like extent of how these watches can fit into my life but maybe I am just being ignorant and a new one will be incredible."
5565,"I‚Äôm stuck on getting an Apple Watch. On 1 hand I really want one because it Would be useful for work, on another hand I‚Äôm buying an AP royal oak next year. Feels like id be wasting my Apple Watch."
5566,I got to upgrade my apple watch 2‚Ä¶ so freaking slow and dies so fast. most apps don‚Äôt even work anymore.

5577,It's probably next to impossible to make it thinner and not lose battery life.
5578,"I hope they sacrifice a bit of battery life to get at least 2-3 mm thinner. 

I also hope they sell a MagSafe portable power brick that I can slip under my wrist as I wear it. 

If not, I‚Äôll probably just keep wearing my Jacob and Co. 3 axis Tourbillion."
5579,"Yea, it‚Äôs the only Apple product that would actually benefit from being thinner."

5581,My battery lasts a day and a half. How long are you getting?
5582,"Form what I‚Äôve been reading over the past year or so it seems incredibly unlikely for at least a while. I‚Äôm hopeful they do it too since it would be a game changer for the health industry and a nice feature to have, but it‚Äôs complicated given the need for non invasive tech and accurate sensing.

I‚Äôm looking forward to the redesign for the S7 though. It may be my first Apple Watch experience!"
5583,Someone I know has been using a few different continuous glucose monitors and they‚Äôre kind of a handful. Can‚Äôt imagine a watch pulling it off. Don‚Äôt wait around for Apple Watch to have this tech.
5584,"Wow!

How is that working for you currently?"
5585,$250 entry level device.   Lol
5586,You should do what you want. You have the same info we do and it‚Äôs your money.

5588,"Wait for Tuesday‚Äôs news.  

If the 7 doesn‚Äôt have a nice blue color, I‚Äôll probably go with a discounted 6.    But I‚Äôd the 7 offers 4 days of charge, I‚Äôll get that regardless of color"
5589,Why?
5590,"It‚Äôs Reddit, that‚Äôs what we do."
5591,Me too.  And new design as well.
5592,God yes. So sick of poor battery life. Worst part about my watch imo
5593,Oh man. I don't text or email or browse or do anything on my watch and I'm great with that. I haven't downloaded a new watch app in years. I love my watch but can't imagine choosing that over a phone.
5594,True that.
5595,I‚Äôm only upgraded to 5 series because of the AOD and battery life.  I didn‚Äôt see the point upgrading to 6 so I skipped that one.
5596,"Similar for me. My old bicycle looks like it won‚Äôt make it through the year, it needs a lot of work including new wheels. I am hesitant to buy the replacements though  as I will be replacing my old rusty bicycle with a Ferrari in a year."

Congrats on the RO, and the success in life that has brought you here. If you‚Äôre buying a RO, surely you have a nice watch collection already. 

The iWatches purpose for me, is for the gym and sleep. If you‚Äôre not keeping up on these things, and have a desire to, the watch is a great way to stay motivated. 

I have a hard time with work life balance- more work than life, and your health and fitness is worth more than anything else (besides family)"
5602,Wtf is a Royal Oak? Sounds like a golf course lol
5603,"Eh, get the aluminium non cellular apalerma watch, enjoy it for a year, then keep it around for when you‚Äôre working out and stuff"
5604,On which hand?
5605,"Just sell the Apple Watch later? I mean, it will loose some value, but you can probably afford flushing a $100 down the drain when you‚Äôre getting a Royal Oak."
5606,"My 2 slowed down a year after launch with the new watchOS and then another year later was absolute dog shit. Got a 4 and it‚Äôs been good ever since. 

It was really annoying that even the basic functionality, turn wrist to wake display and see the time, was laggy. Barely could function as a watch."
5607,I‚Äôm still perfectly happy on the 3. Charge every other day and it‚Äôs fine for things like replying to messages and tracking workouts and sleep. What upgrades are the best ones you‚Äôre enjoying?

5611,"Yeah it‚Äôs a weird one eh. 

Minor point of order though. 

Series 6 is actually the thinnest Apple Watch ever by a tiny fraction. 

So there‚Äôs hope that Apple does value thinness after all."
5612,"Nah. 

For one they‚Äôve done it before. 

Series 3-4 got thinner and battery life was improved. 

Thickness/Depth is only one measurement.  If the watch gets wider and taller then that‚Äôs going to give them more space inside. 

They can also further miniaturise the other stuff inside to make more space for more battery. 

They can also optimise battery efficiencies. Like even lower power processing and display tech that draws less power."

Before AW I also had Garmin and I had the reference point, probably that's why it felt more painful too."
5615,"There are people on Reddit who won‚Äôt be happy until the watch can go 3 or 4 days on a single charge.

It‚Äôs always gonna require charging at some point, isn‚Äôt it just simpler to have a routine around charging it daily?"
5616,I love my aw5. It helped alot last year especially at work I didn‚Äôt have to use my phone. Now I have a 9 month old who I always have to keep a eye on so if I get a text I can literally just check my watch and see who it is. Most of the time I just respond from the watch. I love it

5618,"The light-based glucose-monitoring tech has been around for quite a while at this point. I remember reading about it back in 2010/2011 when it was just getting underway. I haven't found any good articles about the current status of the tech lately, though.

I'd imagine that, as technology does, it's gotten cheaper and more accurate in the last decade. The question is whether it's cheap enough for a device like the Apple Watch, and accurate enough to replace finger-prick testing.

It would be a hugely disruptive tech to include if it satisfies both of those requirements.  There's *big* money being made exploiting the testing needs of diabetics.  I wouldn't doubt there's some part of that industry doing whatever they can to stall or prevent something like this coming to market."

Trust me, there‚Äôs no conspiracy. The first to do glucose monitoring without a prick of any kind is going to make a killing. They all currently require a device to be imbedded in your skin at the moment and frequent maintenance. 

As for current glucose monitoring, using a CGM with a smartphone is a nightmare as the FDA has to approve each version of the device‚Äôs app. This often means you can‚Äôt update your OS or risk your monitor no longer working.

When you forget to charge it, is it on your wrist overnight? Or do you take it off and not place it on a charger?

I‚Äôd really love for Apple to simply the charging experience generally. Perhaps a way to wirelessly charge from an iPhone?"
5642,"I totally hear you. Totally understand the use case. When I go hiking it‚Äôs really quite annoying to bring a watch charger with me, 

But i think there should be better solutions out there than stuffing the watch with battery for the 5 or 6 times a year that we go 3 days without charging.

Assuming you‚Äôre at least taking your phone camping with you? And that you might be bringing some from of power to keep that charged? I‚Äôd just really like to see apple simplify the way the watch charges, something Qi based, something that lets the watch charge via the iphone? I dono. 

I totally hear how annoying the watch is to charge when traveling, but when you‚Äôre not traveling I‚Äôm always gonna charge it daily, its just simpler to have a routine like that,  once you have a routine around charging your devices they‚Äôre just never out of battery and you never even have to worry about it."
5643,"Like I said. It‚Äôs always gonna require charging at some point. 

So as long as it can go at least 24 hours I don‚Äôt really see the point of pushing it dramatically beyond that. 

I feel for you that your series 5 can‚Äôt last a day. That suuucks. 

But this is a wearable device. At some point it should matter how light and thin it is."
5644,That‚Äôs crazy my se lasts just under 3 days on a charge. I don‚Äôt even have a charger at my girlfriends house because it don‚Äôt need it.
5645,Thank you! She‚Äôs a handful lol
5646,"Good points.  I agree that they couldn't get away with the ""non-medical"" distinction that they do for the blood-oxygen sensor. Some folks would be using that glucose data to determine things like insulin dosage.  That's not something you want to mess around with.

I would assume that they'd need to deal with any sort of glucose monitoring function in roughly the same way the EKG function (which IIRC also required FDA approval) is managed. I'm not sure of the particular details of what's required for that, but I'd guess it's similar to other medical devices."

5648,"Not a very good flex if you‚Äôve never heard of it. It is unnecessary, but so are muscle cars from the 60s and yet people buy them. Just a hobby."
5649,Is the luxury watch industry something you weren‚Äôt aware existed or what?
5650,I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt make a charging sleep band.  Plug the watch into a soft band that contains a battery and wear it night.  Then plug in the band to charge all day.
5651,"I charge it in the evening because I wear it at night for sleep tracking. Usually what happens is that I get invested in something at home and forget to charge it before bedtime, then I have to just put it on the charger during the night and lose that night‚Äôs sleep tracking so I can use it the next day. Normally this works fine but on days I‚Äôve been using a lot of transit directions it dies before the end of the day easily."
5652,"Fair points.  If the battery life was a bit longer I‚Äôd be happier.  I do like the AOD but I need the watch to not die on me before I get home.  Here‚Äôs hoping the 7 series does better, Apple always seems to improve battery life each generation by virtue of advancing tech."
5653,"> Like I said. It‚Äôs always gonna require charging at some point. 

Yeah, you'll always need to refuel or recharge your car. But isn't it nice that it gets like a solid 300-400 miles on a tank/charge? 

Essentially what you're saying is ""you're always going to need to refuel/recharge, so why does it matter that you only get 50 miles at a time?""

I much rather recharge my Apple Watch once every 5 days than once every 18 hours."
5654,"No, not even close. Royal oaks are not income generating assets and I don‚Äôt know that you can make a solid long term investment case. People buy the, because they like them"
5655,"Yeah they can do whatever they want with their money but I do think there‚Äôs absolutely a difference between a hobby and a flex where only a micro fraction of the population knows and can afford what you have. Think of it like someone traveling to Rome at a value hotel, vs someone who states at in the presidential suite at the most expensive hotel in Rome. At the end of the day, the person who stayed at a value hotel is going to have the same overall experience, but the presidential suite traveler is going to say ‚Äúat least I stayed in the most expensive room though‚Äù. I looked at what those Royal Oak watches looked like and they don‚Äôt look any different from the nice $100 watches you can get at Macy‚Äôs. And yes, you can tell me every single thing about the watches that makes them special, but I couldn‚Äôt imagine anyone besides another $50k+ watch owner would care about lol. Like I said they can do whatever they want with their money, I won‚Äôt try and argue about against it, but the ONLY reason someone spends that much money on a watch is because they can, not because they need or even want to."
5656,"I know what a Rolex is, that‚Äôs pretty much the only luxury brand of watch I can name. I had a g-shock when I was a young teen, but otherwise the only watches I ever owned was that and my Apple Watch. When I was in college I started wearing a pedometer to count my steps, which is why I enjoy the Apple Watch (and also because it helps me stay off my phone as much because I see my notifications on my watch instead of checking my phone throughout the day)"
5657,This would be amazing.
5658,I would LOVE this.
5659,"For what it‚Äôs worth my series 6 can go about two days if I don‚Äôt do any workouts. 

I suspect the changes to WatchOS 8 are not going to favour the battery life though   

The enhancements to always on display functionality are very welcome but they probably won‚Äôt help the battery situation"
5660,"Bad analogy. Just off the top of my head:

-	You can fuel up a car and leave it for a week and its gonna have exactly the same amount of fuel when you leave it.

-	People don‚Äôt have gas stations at their houses.

-	Getting fuel is way way more annoying than recharging your watch.

-	Space isnt a premium in a car, you can make the tank 20% larger without making the car 20% larger.



>	I much rather recharge my Apple Watch once every 5 days than once every 18 hours

Agree to disagree eh? I just don‚Äôt understand this logic.

So you‚Äôre either always aware of what day you last charged your watch or constantly checking how much battery your watch has?

I dont even think about the battery life of my watch, when i take it off at night i put it on the charge. Simple as that, i never even think about the watch having a battery that needs to be recharged."
5661,"Agreed 99%. But someone spending this much money on a watch is doing it obviously because they can, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they want to as well. If I had that much money to pretty much waste, I would totally buy a watch instead of something like an old car like I mentioned. It‚Äôs more interesting in my eyes. And car guys would probably scratch their heads about why all the same."
5662,Battery life on the WatchOS8 Beta have been atrocious on my series 6
5663,"> Bad analogy

Perhaps. 

But at least I'm not splitting hairs to try to make my absolutely nonsensical opinion fit.

Do you really not see how less battery life is not ideal? It's not a complicated concept. You keep going on and on about routine but fail to realize that if it lasted 5 days, you could still have a routine... just not daily. 

To answer your question: yes I am always 100% aware of my battery charge status. And on my previous fitbit that lasted 3-4 days, when I saw it was at or around 15% battery I knew I could still go like 12-24 hours with it before I needed to recharge. It's really nice seeing 15% battery and not having to rush to a charger or have that be on the back of your head like if you're at the gym or went for a walk with your dog or something."
5664,"Meh, even if I was a car or watch person I couldn‚Äôt see myself spending that much on anything. Well I guess the equivalent of a car would be a lot more expensive too. Let‚Äôs put it this way, if I came into a fortune I could dock around with, I would pay off student debts and buy a house first. I would probably upgrade my car, but I wouldn‚Äôt be buying a Ferrari or anything like that. Other than that‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt really think my spending would change all that much if at all."
5665,Well it‚Äôs a beta. But I‚Äôm worried to hear that
5666,"Dude, it‚Äôs not that I *want less battery life* 

Obviously less battery life is not ideal. 

It‚Äôs that *I want a thinner watch*"
5667,It‚Äôs not like it won‚Äôt make it through the day bad but it definitely needs a before bed and a wake up in the morning top up (if you sleep with it) and I still end up in the 30s by the end of the day with always on display.
5668,This review was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks man.
5669,"WiFi on my Carlyle is turned off, no issues with Google Assistant unless watch and phone are too far to connect via BT.

Turning off WiFi makes a big difference in battery life."
5670,"I also have the iPhone 8 and Carlyle combo. 

I don't mind it. It's not perfect, but I'm learning what I want out of a smart watch without spending $800. The watch does look great and the notifications are handy. Spotify control is good, but can be a little laggy if you open on the phone rather than just start it on the phone and use watch audio controls only.

Agree that the Wear OS app has to be open in the background, but this doesn't bother me. And I did find out the headphone trick (Jabra 75t) and TBH I prefer to run off their mic rather than the watch.

Would really love to respond to iMessages from the watch though."
5671,"Very Helpful review.

 what about notifications , what works and what doesn't?

For how much time have  you had it? And how much did it cost you?

I am an iPhone 8 user, not planning to move to Android, but I wanted a ""good looking"" smart watch, which is why I am planning to get the Fossil Gen 5."
5672,Yeah I was looking for a thorough iOS review but couldn‚Äôt find much so I thought it would be helpful to those in similar shoes.
5673,I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre using an Android phone?
5674,"Every notification I get on my phone, I get on my watch, all first party IOS apps and third party apps. None of them are interactive, but I‚Äôm okay with that. 

I‚Äôve had it for about a week now. Got it for $220 at Target but I believe that sale is over. These Fossil watches commonly go on sale so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it drop back to a similar price soon."
5675,"Oh forgot to mention, anytime you swipe away a notification, it does swipe away from the iPhone system as well. I was expecting otherwise, so pleasantly surprised."
5676,"Ah, yes. Didn't occur to me at time of post things might be diff on iOS."
5677,"It amuses me how everyone was expecting a total redesign‚Ä¶this is just a slightly larger screen, higher dust rating and faster charging. 

Eh."
5678,"As someone who doesn‚Äôt have an Apple Watch, I‚Äôm gonna get one.

I‚Äôm not really sure why people with a 6, or 5, even thought about upgrading this year‚Ä¶ surely something a year/2 years old is still going strong and doesn‚Äôt NEED to be upgraded?

Like I said, I don‚Äôt own a Watch, but it kinda feels like they‚Äôre at a point now where like the iPhone and iPad, the annual updates aren‚Äôt always going to change the world of its users. Some of the health sensor rumours that were knocking about seem like they‚Äôre years out from now and all that leaves is iterative changes for them to toy with in the in-between years.

Each to their own though - I‚Äôm sorry some are disappointed. Maybe S8 next year will give you what you want!

EDIT: Typo/Grammar."
5679,You think I should upgrade from a S3?
5680,"Wonder if those ‚Äúrugged edition‚Äù watches were just referring to the dust resistance

I have an S4 been waiting for a while‚Ä¶.."
5681,"No, nothing really changed. I will keep my Series 6"
5682,"Hardly. It's a bit of a joke almost. The annual cycle is forcing them to pretend it's always such a big deal... it would be sweet to see a return to the days of releasing things when it's legitimately a jump in tech and innovation. 
Also, no battery increase! The heck...

And not just Apple btw, a lot of the industry is like this üòî"
5683,Will this full keyboard be specific to the 7 or will it be part of the new OS
5684,I don‚Äôt think they have released a watch worth upgrading since the Series 4. I went into today fully expecting to buy a new watch. Perfectly happy to wait another year.
5685,"I‚Äôm keeping my Series 5 and by the look of things, I will keep my iPhone 11 Pro Max as well ;-)"
5686,Will wait and see what apples own trade in deals are. I was pretty impressed with the value they were giving old watches last year.
5687,Seems like a good time to snatch a discount S6
5688,Quick charge is the main thing I‚Äôve wanted. I love my series 5. Just wish I could realize I forgot to charge it overnight and set it on to charge a few minutes without missing precious gym time in the morning. I‚Äôll be happily upgrading but realize that‚Äôs not as big a deal for everyone.
5689,"Coming from a Series 4, I was hoping for more health sensors included this year. I‚Äôd like to upgrade to an always-on-display and a cellular model, I just don‚Äôt really see the Series 7 as enough."
5690,"Yes. But does it justify ordering if you have an S5/S6? Probably not. I went from an S4 to an S6 after upgrading my wife from an S3 to an S5 and am very happy with the upgrade as always on display was a bigger deal than I had initially thought when the S5 came out. 

I won't be rushing to upgrade either of our watches unless there is a crazy trade in deal for an S3/S5 to S7 option."
5691,As someone who upgrades every year I would be passing unless the buyer backs out.
5692,Won‚Äôt be upgrading from S3 until blood glucose monitoring or temp sensor and a new SOC.
5693,Hopefully the s8 will be better
5694,"No reason to upgrade from my series 6. I upgraded from a series 2 last year and that was a huge leap. No freezing and I'm actually able to use the workout features without a 30 second delay, the walkie talkie actually works great and is responsive, and I can pick up phone calls from my watch without the whole thing freezing or not responding to taps. This S7 doesn't even have a better battery life."
5695,I was seriously hoping for a blood glucose monitor
5696,"I think it's to simply stay ahead of the game at all times. I have a S6, and there is basically no reason whatsoever to run out and get a S7, but if you don't have one of those then the S7 is still one of the newest and top of the line smart watch you can get. 

They aren't doing it to try and convince you to upgrade."
5697,"Coming from an S3, it's a pretty decent upgrade for me. The annual update cycle hasn't been worth it in basically any product line for a while now. If I had a 5 or 6 I'd likely be sticking with it for another year or two."
5698,I mean you could say that about all of em since series 5
5699,"Watches aren't meant to be upgraded every year just like cars, it's for those with older generations who would be more satisfied.

Obviously, tech enthusiasts would feel it is underwhelming though haha."
5700,"Same processor - S6 chip as last year
Same battery üîã 
Stronger Screen they say but i will still purchase Applecare+ .
So, the real change is 20 % larger display to fit a keyboard and some new watch faces??? !!!!!!
C‚Äômon apple !!"
5701,"Nah, I‚Äòll keep my series 6"
5702,"I mean cycling auto-pause is a HUGE new feature.

Although it should have been there from the start and I have no idea why they can‚Äôt implement it via software update to prior versions of the watch."
5703,What's even new? lol
5704,The Apple Watch is already pretty fucking good - it's hard to iterate on that. I'm buying it - I don't have one currently but I had a S4 that I sold a few years back. I can definitely se the value in this vs the 4.
5705,what‚Äòs new actually? apart from the 1mm increase in size.
5706,This was a bait and switch. Series 6+. New processor is annual. No processor. I guarantee it's gonna come out that Apple had to redo the Series 6 with new firmware due to the issues with production. And they can't blame it on the screen lamination because it's all one piece from the supplier. I worked for Motorola making phones here in Dallas almost 10 years ago and you get all the modules delivered from suppliers ready to slap together.
5707,Doesn‚Äôt seem like it.
5708,"I think a new screen was basically the only thing that changed.

Oh there was dust resistance I think, not sure how new that is though"
5709,Yes.
5710,Honestly I was hoping for the redesign to upgrade from my current SE. But I‚Äôll be putting that money towards the iPhone 13 pro max.
5711,This year was more of a cosmetic update. Nothing real cool or exciting! So am off year. Meaning save the money
5712,"My series 5 just died out of warranty, might get the 7‚Ä¶ its a sign!"
5713,Yeah it seems really underwhelming. My 1st gen apple watch just popped open and I was hoping that Series 7 would be the obvious buy as the replacement ... but now I just don't know.
5714,From an S3 or 4 maybe. S6 definitely a no for me
5715,All for the sake of being environmentally friendly!
5716,Agree.  Super boring.
5717,Definitely not!
5718,"I just came over to Apple from Android this year. I have a Huawei GT2 that has a lot of cool features and lasts at least 5 days with Always On. It was also ridiculously cheap compared to an AW. It doesn't play nice with my iPhone though so I was hoping to get an AW Series 7 because I thought Apple would extend the battery life. Alas no. The bigger screen will require more juice too, so that 18 hours will be even tighter. I'm very disappointed that the battery life is the same as the Series 6."
5719,"Yeah, I feel like I am picking a bad time to come back to Apple from Android. I feel like the next releases will be better and I‚Äôll want to upgrade but won‚Äôt be able to justify it."
5720,"My series 4 does almost everything the 7 can do, looks like its a firm no for me."
5721,They justify a release to someone. Maybe not a direct upgrade.
5722,"No. At least not if you have a 6. If I had an older one, yes. 

Maybe if there were other new colors. The dark green doesn't appeal to me personally, but the people who like it might upgrade for that. As for features, I didn't see anything big.

I'm guessing that next year will be the re-design. Maybe that flat design that was leaked will actually be next year's update?"
5723,I wont upgrade mine ( S4 ) until i cant get updates anymore.
5724,"Yes, absolutely. Why would they hold tech back arbitrarily? Most folks upgrade every 2-4 years and there is no reason to hold incremental upgrades back."
5725,"It was very disappointing, not worth the upgrade at all"
5726,Exactly. God dammit
5727,"I have a S2 and no longer get updates so I'm thinking about it, but i don't think upgrading from the more modern watches would be a big draw, given what they showed."
5728,Nope
5729,"As a buyer who is no upgrading from an old watch, it is very compelling."
5730,I would like a band option like what FitBit has. That would be worth investing in.
5731,I have a series 4 and haven‚Äôt felt the need to upgrade since. My watch works just as good as the day I got it.
5732,"I'm an android guy when it comes to mobile, but use Apple Macs. I love the apple watch 7 for all its health features. If I buy one will there be any compatibility with an android phone. Can I use my Mac? Am I wasting my money?"
5733,As a first time buyer I‚Äôm loving it. But based on what I‚Äôve seen from previous iterations I don‚Äôt see why someone would upgrade. Same with the phone. I‚Äôm still on the 11. I can‚Äôt justify an upgrade yet based on my own personal use.
5734,"No, this was a Joe Biden sized fuck-up."
5735,I just wanted a better battery.
5736,Why does it amuse you?
5737,"Completely agree with you! Shocked some with the 6 were actually thinking of upgrading in the first place. It‚Äôs still a damn good watch. Heck I still own a series 3 and personally haven‚Äôt found any features worth spending $$$ on. Yeah ecg and o2 are cool but are they reallllly that necessary for the average, everyday user?"
5738,"Same. I‚Äôm getting the s7 as my first Apple Watch because why not get the 7 if I don‚Äôt already have one. But it doesn‚Äôt make sense when I see people saying ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs the same as my series 6. I won‚Äôt be upgrading this year‚Äù. These watches should be lasting 3 maybe 4 years. It‚Äôs the same with iPhones. Unless you absolutely must upgrade for work, I don‚Äôt see the need to buy the latest model every year other than to appear wealthy to others."
5739,I know right?  There's no way an Apple watch should be an annual purchase for anyone.
5740,"Yessir, gonna get the 7 as my first Apple Watch too. But if I already had one I wouldn't upgrade"
5741,"I only have a 4 but the biggest issue I have with aw is the daily charging.  

Coming from amaze fit bip that lasts up to a month between charges it's a real pain.

Even if I had a 6 I would have upgraded for better battery life"
5742,"Agree - the only thing they could have done for me as a S5 user was a big redesign or significant step forward in battery. There‚Äôs an argument for the health features, but for my use the only big improvement made in the last 3 generations was always-on display. Improved the AW experience for me in every interaction."
5743,which watch are you getting?
5744,That‚Äôs my question too. I was pretty excited to upgrade
5745,"I think I'm going to upgrade to the S7 from the S3. Bigger screen real estate and ECG are the features I'm looking forward to. I don't need any of the rumored health tracking, such as blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring. Who knows if the watch will actually do those things accurately in the future?"
5746,I would get the 6 when stores start unloading stock. I have the 6 and am not upgrading.
5747,I would wait until Series 8 next year
5748,"Heck, I‚Äôll keep my series 5.."
5749,"I think it's impossible to impress anyone year to year, but they need to pump it up to excite users with two or three year old devices otherwise they'll feel like even that upgrade is insignificant and wait for a big reveal to upgrade. It makes sense to upgrade from an 3/4 to the 7, from the 6... not so much."
5750,7 due to larger display
5751,I use an app called flicktype keyboard on my 5 that seems to do the same thing.  I barely use it though as it's hardly worth the effort and a lot of the time you can just dictate a message just as easily.
5752,Didn't series 5 introduce AOD? That's a must-have personally.
5753,Ditto.
5754,"I‚Äôm keeping my s5 and upgrading my iPhone X, probably to the iPhone 13 Pro. (It‚Äôs definitely time for the phone.)"
5755,Trade in on the series 6 is like $150. Won't be much more than that if anything. I'd just go and get the new screen put on the series 6 chassis. That's all Apple did.
5756,They said 100 for my stainless 44m series 4
5757,Discount series 4***
5758,"I have an s4 and the always-on is the main thing for me, I was hoping for a new sensor or something in the 7, but I feel like the 4 doesnt turn the display on and off well with my own personal habits...

Decisions decisions."
5759,That's what we said about s7 after s6's marginal improvement over s5 lol
5760,LOL üòÇ
5761,"According to [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-8/), thats just a watchOS 8 feature, not exclusive to Series 7"
5762,"Faster charging, better dust resistance, new colors....
Well that's it"
5763,How is it a bait and switch when they didn't release any info before? Just because you chose to believe leaks doesn't mean you should be annoyed by apple
5764,">I worked for Motorola making phones here in Dallas almost 10 years ago and you get all the modules delivered from suppliers ready to slap together

yes that's clearly the same thing"
5765,"Just FYI, the 18 hour battery claim has never been accurate- In practice, the S6 always got at least a day and a half of battery with AOD. I doubt the S7 will consume more power than the S6‚Äôs display, since you‚Äôre looking at pure black more often than not- the total lit up area is prolly going to be very similar to the S6."
5766,Yikes man.
5767,"Nah, it's not THAT bad."
5768,"How is apple supposed to have a better battery without making it thick and an unwieldy brick? The only battery life solution is new tech, which won‚Äôt just be an apple breakthrough. The battery life is at its upper limit right now for the size of the watch. It is what it is"
5769,Faster charging is more important than bigger battery imo
5770,"I guess faster charging has to suffice‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs my main complaint. I‚Äôve actually moved away from the AW in favor of regular non-smart watches but I could see myself snagging a series 6 on discount now. 

Been using my series 4 for sleep tracking though! Especially now that I have a bipap machine I use at night."
5771,I wanted a 3D display üòÇ
5772,*Technically* it is a better battery but only enough to cover for the faster charging and bigger and brighter display.
5773,Or at least the ability to replace it myself.
5774,"Battery longevity is apples main obsession, apparently. Can‚Äôt imagine how much engineering went into powering a watch 6 with cellular for an entire day. Mine lasts no problem from 5am to around 10pm when I go to sleep."
5775,"Because all the people going ‚Äúyay, it looks just like the new iPhones! This is totally trustworthy info!‚Äù didn‚Äôt stop to think that maaaaaybe it was either a) BS some guy made up or b) disinformation put out by Apple to completely screw with people. 

Sometimes Apple surprises us all. I take all these *trustworthy leaks* with the same grain of salt every time."
5776,I might have been tempted if they‚Äôd rolled out blood sugar monitoring or something dramatically new
5777,"I switched from Series 3 to SE because of the updating issue. But otherwise it was a solid watch. Sure it‚Äôs nice to update without having to unpair and the new faces are nice. But the battery definitely drains faster

Edit: I did also go from a 42mm to a 40mm as it fits my wrist better"
5778,"The screen size jump from the 3 to the 4 was big for me. Not only size but the fact it isn‚Äôt a weird rectangle. 

Every watch since then, though? Nothing noteworthy. I probably won‚Äôt upgrade till the 4 loses support, or breaks."
5779,"sorry but for someone like me who had the series 3 and couldn‚Äôt even use it as a regular watch without making a weird gesture, the always on was a quick upgrade to the 6. i skipped the 5 tho"
5780,"I‚Äôm on a Series 3 also. I‚Äôm a podcast junkie and the Overcast app kinda is just broken now after the last big Apple Watch update. 

The only other thing that irks me is watch faces. Seems silly but that‚Äôs one of my main motivators to upgrade. 

Still love my S3 despite everything else!!"
5781,"Absolutely. I think it‚Äôs a bit wasteful, and slightly redundant, updating annually for marginal improvements. If you can afford to and following the latest and greatest is what makes you happy, then of course go ahead, but it‚Äôs not my mantra when it comes to tech.

I‚Äôm still rocking my iPhone X. In fact, I had the battery replaced in July and it feels like the day I bought it. I can‚Äôt miss what I haven‚Äôt had, and it‚Äôll easily get me through to iPhone 14, and I reckon the iPhone 15 if I continue to look after it. 5/6 years for a ¬£999 (+¬£69 battery replacement) phone seems pretty sweet to me."
5782,Yep. With the possible exception of the 3 to 4 jump.
5783,"I get that. I feel like battery tech is the limiting factor for a lot of the ‚Äòpremium tries to do everything‚Äô smart devices atm. It‚Äôs incremental at best nowadays.

The 45 min to 80% and 8 min for 8 hour sleep tracking sounds decent to me (as an Apple Watch newbie) as I can already see how that‚Äôll fit into my routine, but I get it. I would probs want something more substantial if I was an existing Watch owner."
5784,"I‚Äôve gone in store and tried the S6, and I think the 41mm in graphite stainless steel is for me. I‚Äôm quite happy investing a little more into it as I plan on keeping it until it‚Äôs pretty much redundant - the titanium model was on my radar but anecdotal evidence doesn‚Äôt seem too compelling it‚Äôs worth that extra cost. It‚Äôs a lovely looking watch tho!"
5785,Do you have a guess as to how much the price of the 6 will go down? I have a 3 and my plan the whole time has been to wait for the 7 to come out to get a 6 lol
5786,"Heck, I'm keeping my series 4!"
5787,"Mmm, a good point!"
5788,"Personally I‚Äôve never cared for that feature, but to each their own"
5789,Today?
5790,"I initially thought always on was useless, but it‚Äôs really nice because even when it doesn‚Äôt turn on, you‚Äôre still seeing at least something. Used prices on the watches are usually pretty reasonable. I got my lte bike s6 for under $400 in December. It was in new condition"
5791,"I mean, we had a new blood O2 sensor, always-on altimeter, much better always-on display and more on the Series 6. In comparison, Series 7 is a joke"
5792,Ye i know üò≠üò≠
5793,Nice! They were not super clear about that in the video.
5794,Everything but the new screen is firmware driven. From battery saving to faster charging. This watch is a Series 6+
5795,"yeah that‚Äòs literally nothing, and I was REALLY looking forward to upgrading from S4."
5796,"Where is the new processor this year?  The bodies were already leaked and being sold on the streets in China (same as every other apple design).  Where are the 45mm bands that ""only fit the new watch body"". No one spends that much money on production unless it's gonna happen. The truth is something screwed up and they had to scrap it all in a panic to meet the deadline. Imagine the free fall Apple stock would  be in if it was announced that a watch design already in production with JIT parts orders were trashed. It's gonna come out. Mark my words. We will find out soon the other watch was supposed to be this year with a new processor and larger battery. Apple doesn't just have TSMC spend money making a new chip to toss it out. The new chip info was production info from TSMC. TSMC doesn't do stuff for free."
5797,Actually the process is the same. It's all assembly line. No difference between any phone/smartwatch/tablet. It's all about putting the parts in the frame in order and using the tools that are preset to torque down the screws or apply the two sided adhesive films. Anyone who has done any electronics assembly work can do the job.
5798,"Ok, that's not so bad then. Thanks for taking the time to explain this."
5799,"Software optimization seems to be how Apple has been improving the iPhone batteries in recent years, not by making a bigger pack"
5800,They said the always-on display would be 70% brighter outside. So they are burning what they gained in battery capacity and efficiency there. I would expect improved battery life when turning always-on off.
5801,"Well they increased the iPhone 13 battery in the same case as the iPhone 12.

I'm not a hardware engineer but they seemed to rework the internals to allow for a bigger battery. Same might be done for Apple Watch I would think."
5802,"thick isn‚Äôt the only option. i‚Äôd go for one of those diver-sized platter watches (ish). but i‚Äôm probably more the exception in that regard.


apple‚Äôs shooting for the sizes that most people will buy and they can command the most control price-wise/part-wise. too much battery/screen puts it out of sweet-spot mass purchasing (why i suspect no titanium/stainless steel this year)."
5803,Fusion‚Ä¶
5804,"* More power efficient processor
* More power efficient display (this may have happened since the always-on display is brighter with S7)
* A more useful power reserve mode (not exactly the same thing but it would be helpful)
* Larger battery by making other internals smaller (SoaC, sensors etc)
* That crazy rumor that Apple somehow added battery tech to bands (obviously a crazy long shot but you never know)

Lots of options!"
5805,"I hear you, but how to other brands like fitbit make their offerings last so long? Genuine question, if I had to guess, they just do less‚Ä¶?"
5806,DUH....by making better battery? i mean...that would be same size but better in every way...? what is so hard about it wtf.
5807,How? You barely need 1 hour to make full use of the watch for a day. How is faster even worth it? You just go take a shower and have breakfast and the watch is juiced up.
5808,"How has it tied in with your bipap? Or how have you been using it to track your sleep in conjunction with the bipap? I have a cpap and use the resmed myair app on my phone to track my sleep 

I don‚Äôt own an Apple Watch and was considering the 7, but I agree with most commenters here that this update seems underwhelming. Not sure if I should get the s6, s7 or wait another year"
5809,Just wait a few months. I was able to get an essentially new Nike Apple watch S6 LTE for $370 off of ebay in December.
5810,"I don‚Äôt think people think ‚Äúwow these leaks are 100% going to happen‚Äù but I think when there is what seems to be credible info from sources that have been credible in the past suggesting a design that people are keen for, then yes people are going to get their hopes up.

Also, Apple forgot to remove the supposed redesign from one of its images during the presentation. So there is weight to the evidence of there being a redesign however it may have been postponed due to last minute production problems.

But if that‚Äôs where Apple wants to play then so be it."
5811,"App works with a patch for blood sugar monitoring, we have many patients come in with one every week to update their primary care provider. It‚Äôs pretty intuitive."
5812,The website did a terrible job explaining the differences between the SE and the regular Apple Watch. Can you help me out?
5813,"Yeah I think for a lot of people it will be fine.  I accept I am a pretty weird one as I have no routine.  

I may get up at 6 am or 1PM on any given day just depending on lots of random factors.  

I may have nothing to do for hours after I wake up or have to hit the ground running.  I may be watching netflix for hours before bed or I may be up until my eyes won't stay open working on some project or problem.

So I am always glancing at my watch and seeing under 30% battery at any given time and have to then go put it on the charger where I will usually forget about it and hours later realize I don't have it on and have been missing steps or even maybe left the house without it. 

If I could get at least 4 days between charges I would be a much happier camper."
5814,it will probably be just a bit more than the SE as to not cannibalize SE sales. and not so much cheaper than the 7 to derail the launch of a new model.
5815,Last year the S5 prices barely nudged down when the S6 came out. I would think there will be non-Apple deals pretty quick on the S7
5816,"I am actually keeping my series 3 that I bought a few months after launch.
It still works fine.
Bigger display would be nice. But new form factor was the sell to me."
5817,"Same! I did just book in my AppleCare battery replacement as it's under 80% charge now. So this should do me for another year happily!
I'm back when they add some new health tracking features."
5818,Yep. Was looking at the trade in for the series 6 just to get an idea for when 7 is available and was incredibly bummed to see only 100
5819,"Valid suggestion where have you looked for legit used, just ebay?  I always worry about buying something stolen or a knock off."
5820,"Agreed that compared to S6, the S7 marginal increase is a massive joke. But the S6's marginal (albeit not as bad as the S7's) increase over the S5 was still a joke in its own right."
5821,"They moved to watchOS 8 features relatively quickly, as the Series 7 new features went through quickly :P"
5822,Eh those combined with the previous stuff (AOD especially) and *especially* the keyboard make me very interested
5823,[deleted]
5824,"Software optimization and better energy efficiency in the SoC, and apparently the Series 7 is the first year we don't get a new SoC in the watch."
5825,Yeah they have much smaller batteries compared to the competitors but equal in battery life.
5826,I thought they said indoors and not outdoors?
5827,"""And now it‚Äôs 70% brighter indoors when your wrist is¬†down.""

So no a noticeable change."
5828,"The 13 Pro Max is slighter thicker than the 12 Pro Max, coming in at 7.7mm versus 7.4mm."
5829,"Not sure why someone downvoted you, but take my upvote."
5830,different screen tech. Apple is using high end screens and manufacturers like Fitbit aren't matching those
5831,"I like to wear it as close to 24/7 if I can. The battery already lasts 36 hours, i just don‚Äôt know why it needs to be longer than that if I only need to charge it for 30min a day"
5832,"I also have a ResMed machine! Just got it last Tuesday. Been using the myAir app as well. Had my first full 8 hour sleep without waking up more than a few moments in YEARS last night. 

I use AutoSleep just for general sleep tracking when I remember to. Nothing too intricate. :)"
5833,"Oh, I know. 

I got my 44mm series 4 stainless steel the November after the 5 came out, and got it for less than $300."
5834,I did notice that the second image they showed had flatter sides. Maybe they are saving it for the Series 8 which will hopefully get a massive upgrade like this year‚Äôs iPad Mini.
5835,"Not sure I can do a better job than this: 

https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/"
5836,Thanks! I have $200 in Apple gift cards saved right now and want to trade my 3 in as well (I know I won‚Äôt get much) so I‚Äôm hoping to not pay a ton for my 6
5837,Thanks!
5838,"Heck, I‚Äôm still keeping my naked wrist.. been waiting for better battery life"
5839,"Now the question is, should I keep my series 2? I haven‚Äôt seen a single thread talk about that one and I‚Äôm feeling like my friend ripped me off."
5840,"eBay. Knock off Apple watches don‚Äôt exist that wouldn‚Äôt be obvious. And buyer protection is so good that if it is stolen, you can return it tor free"
5841,"yeah I‚Äòll be upgrading too I think, I‚Äòm just not overwhelmed.. 
AOD will be nice."
5842,"""Lack of new chip announcement""  
According to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report accessed by MacRumors, next-generation Apple Watch models will adopt double-sided System in Package (SiP) packaging from Taiwanese supplier ASE Technology.

On its website, ASE Technology confirms that its double-sided technology allows for module miniaturization, paving the way for a smaller ""S7"" chip.

From ASE themselves."

5844,"But honestly S4 and S5 chip were nearly identical too, and I guess Apple would rename S6 as S7 so the chip continues to match the Series number in the future"
5845,Maybe I remembered that part incorrectly. But typically you need more screen brightness outdoors.
5846,They just said today it should last a full ***18 hours*** which was odd to hear because I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not true
5847,"Does it last 36 or 18???
If it lasts over 24 with heavy usage to include gps I'll buy it. If it's 18 then prolly not"
5848,"Congrats to you! I‚Äôve been a year and a half and it‚Äôs changed my life. Best advice I can give is keep at it. You‚Äôll have good night and not good nights, important thing is to keep trying 

Thanks for responding. What does auto sleep track? What are you favorite features?"
5849,Where and how? The cheapest I saw one after the series 5 launch was $400 from best buy
5850,"Awesome, thanks for your helpful responses, may just wait around and grab an S6!"
5851,That keyboard tho üò©
5852,">RemindMe! 1 year

RemindMe! 1 year"
5853,"I agree with you, but here https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-7/ they say indoors. Which really makes no sense, I have never heard anyone blaming the low luminosity indoors..."
5854,"All (or at least most) apple watches are listed at 18h battery, but I‚Äòve always had at least 30h from a full charge. Though i am a light user, using it basically only for notifications and fitness."
5855,18 hours is with always on screen and probably a estimated usage (fitness tracking with gps or similar). I get 30 but that‚Äôs with some features turned off.
5856,"I‚Äôve had every series except the 2, and they‚Äôve all reliably gotten about  18-20 hours when battery health is above 90% and without disabling any flagship features, other than turning off LTE when I don‚Äôt need it on. Moderate usage, activity and heart tracking on, always-on display once that became a thing. To get more than 24 hrs, you‚Äôd likely have to use it very lightly or turn some things off."
5857,"My dad has been after me for years to get checked out. Finally did, and found out I have severe sleep apnea. Stop breathing 60+ times an *hour*.

Got the machine on Tuesday, and‚Ä¶immediately caught a hell of a cold on Wednesday and nearly strangled due to my nose plugging up. Not an auspicious start! Finally got to use it again Saturday night and it‚Äôs been smooth sailing since then. 

Autosleep is a very decent little app, doesn‚Äôt even need to be running in your watch, just analyzes the movements over the night that your watch automatically measures and uses it to show your sleep info. Bought it a year ago and I use it intermittently."
5858,Best Buy. In store. I was floored.
5859,There are apps that do the same thing.
5860,"Even worse, if you read it fully, it's

\>And now it‚Äôs 70% brighter indoors when your wrist is¬†down.

So the brightness while looking at it is still the same. They just adjusted the idle brightness. I hate that Apple makes all these BS claims that sound good at a glance but are actually meaningless under scrutiny."
5861,"I consider myself a light user too. I use it mostly for exercise, checking the time and using the timer. My s5 lasts about 16 hours."
5862,Do you have always on turned on? I am thinking of upgrading from series 3
5863,Well that's good to hear then. Not so bad
5864,I could never get Flicktype to work.
5865,No I have not. But it lasts about two days when it's just for showing notifications and clock with wake on wrist raise.
5866,Really a review of a review 
5867,"Mostly I agree with the article, but there was one thing I wanted to point out.

>He‚Äôs wrong on both counts. While the 38mm Apple Watch does have a 290 PPI resolution, the 42mm Watch he‚Äôs ‚Äúreviewing‚Äô has a resolution of 302 PPI.

Actually, this is wrong, too. Both Watches have ~326ppi screens. The 290 and 302 ppi measurements commonly thrown around are calculated by treating 38mm and 42mm as if they are the diagonal measurement of the display, which is wrong.

On this, though:
>(Ironically, the 42mm Apple Watch looks downright enormous on Brownlee‚Äôs wrist. I honestly think the 38mm would suit him better.)

100% agreed. Super hilarious that he thinks the 38mm is too small while he's wearing a model that's as tall as his whole wrist."
5868,"Was MKBHD's review really so personally devastating to this author's world view that they felt compelled to write an 800+ word rebuttal? This whole article seems like such a waste of time and really unnecessary. 

MKBHD is just one of several reviewers that didn't really care for the Watch, at least in this first generation. So what? He's entitled to that opinion, as are any of the other negative reviews. "
5869,"ITT: People defending an overpriced smartwatch and getting angry at MKBHD for being neutral about it.

Seriously, I'm sure the second gen Apple Watch will be AMAZING, but just like the iPhone 2G and original iPad. Apple's first gen products are toys at best. If history has taught us anything, it's that Apple is AMAZING at making 2nd generation products. First gen is just for getting the branding name out there so that when the REAL product comes next year, the category is established with Apple and they get TONS of sales for an actually great product."
5870,"> ""muh Watch :'((((((( plz stop bullying it :'''''( """
5871,"> He clearly doesn‚Äôt think Apple Watch is a viable product in its own right.

Bacause it isn't. If requires you to have an iPhone to use it in any significant way. Ergo, it's an iPhone accessory. 

Android Wear watches are also phone accessories, but at least it lets you pick the phone. None of them are viable products on their own."
5872,"It's funny. When MKBHD does a positive review of something Apple, all I see in here is ""wow, he's my favorite youtuber"", ""he's the only reviewer I really trust"", ""omg, I've been waiting for his opinion"". 

Then when he keeps being honest (and yes, I guess makes a few mistakes, but he tends to do that every once in a while) and puts out a ""I can't recommend"" tag on a new Apple product, people do nothing but talk shit about him... Well, just look at the comments in this thread. "
5873,[deleted]
5874,"I really respect MKBHD, but this review was just not very comprehensive.

For those who haven't seen it yet, [here is his Apple Watch review.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPL1-8ypnEs)

And for comparison, [his Moto 360 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8DOUSGGw10)"
5875,Really? MKBHD's review pissed the author off so much he had to write a rebuttal?
5876,"Eh,  I didn't really find anything g terrible offensive or bad with his review. I think the issue is that for many reviewers,  the Apple watch is their first smart watch so we're seeing alot of people do their apple watch review based on the review of smart watches themselves.  If anything,  MKBHD could probably point to to previous videos and say ok look those are my views and review on smart watches,  here's what I think is unique to the apple watch itself. "
5877,I dont get why everyone masturbates to his reviews. Plenty of mistakes all the time
5878,"Why do people like him so much? His script is pretty mediocre and just utilizes RED cameras and repetitive extreme shallow depth of field shots to improve production quality. For those who don't know what RED cameras are, they are professional 4k cinema cameras that cost around 50k+. A review should include things that can't just be found a spec sheet "
5879,[deleted]
5880,[removed]
5881,"Yes, the review is a bit short and it is also shorter than the review of the Moto 360. But let's not forget that the review of the 360 was in September 2014 and the Apple Watch doesn't add any special features for a smart watch. He's also an avid Android users, so I think you should keep that in the back of your mind too."
5882,[deleted]
5883,"Not sure why anyone takes YouTube tech reviewers seriously, especially in the phone and tablet space where Google has an operating system competing there. 

You can't say they're unbiased with these reviews, while literally getting paid by Google. "
5884,"Yeah I haven't seen anyone get the PPI right outside of Reddit, and [this is the watch that is almost too small](http://i.imgur.com/1KbV7Oh.png)"
5885,">100% agreed. Super hilarious that he thinks the 38mm is too small while he's wearing a model that's as tall as his whole wrist.

When you're used to wearing Android Wear devices, even the 42mm Apple Watch will look tiny.

I don't know how he gets away with wearing a Moto 360 on that tiny wrist."
5886,He seems very defensive over the Apple Watch.
5887,Well said.
5888,"The larger issue with MKBHD and other Youtube reviewers: if their reviews were actually on paper, they'd look like a spec sheet and then a safe opinion at the end so they could still be invited to the conferences. When you're used to Anandtech reviews and switch over to the likes of MKBHD, you wonder if someone just likes watching him because he outputs in 4K (and I know some people who just want to watch product overviews in high quality). 

The author said it and I agree: this was a product overview, like any other if one googled ""Apple Watch"" and went two pages into the search. Maybe his audience is against thoroughness, but I'm looking for a little more passion in their job."
5889,"I share with him the gripe of people labeling their videos ""reviews"" when they're nothing more than overviews.  It's frustrating when you watch a video expecting to hear a real world opinion, instead you get nothing more than a list of features.  In fact, I'm willing to bet that 95% of YouTube videos labeled ""review"" offer no opinion whatsoever.  Most of the time it's just an excuse for the poster to play with his camera equipment and hear the sound of his own voice."
5890,[deleted]
5891,I was gonna say it's finals week... Also who cares what he thinks about the apple watch... He's a biased android reviewer. Not like he would ever review a ps vita for the OS if sony ever pushes it to a PlayStation phone or windows 10 on a surface pro.
5892,"I'm sorry but you can't say that without actually owning it and using it. Most people are saying it's the most polished first gen product they've ever put out. The second iPad came out more than 4 years and the iPhone 2G was almost 7. Not to mention that was all came with jobs and the watch is Cooks release. Things are different now, I guess we'll see with the second generation watch. "
5893,"I have never seen him do a ""positive review"" for any non-Mac Apple products. "
5894,"His opinion is not the problem. As far as I'm concerned, anyone is welcome to dislike the Apple Watch so long as they have a valid reason to do so (not just ""Apple sux!"" or ""I heard it only gets three hours of battery life""). The review, however, is just bad - factual errors, important watch functionality ignored and late."
5895,"No.

If you would wanted to buy a smart watch for you, you would understand.

"
5896,Yeah I noticed that in most of his Apple related videos. He seems to do a summary of the product rather than do a detailed review like he does for android devices.
5897,"I'm probably opening up myself to hate, but I can't stand him. He's another youtuber who has weaseled together well-crafted but shallow ""content"" to finance their toy collection. There are more insightful reviewers out there either in text or video, from technical points of view or lifestyle points of view. In the area of technical detail his videos are no more substantive than a product page, and from a personal perspective I don't think he is aware of how niche his tastes and expectations are.

That and he managed to snag one of the sapphire iPhone 6 panels before the GT Advance collapse, gaining him a ton of views, and no on has questioned how he got ahold of it."
5898,"Yeah people, you should buy a $249 Motorola 360, instead of a $349 Apple Watch...

The Moto is so much better:

* Apple doesn't have stores where you can speak to someone and get post-sales service

* 8GB on the Apple Watch is much worse than 4GB on the Moto 360

* NFC that you have on the Apple Watch, in conjunction for Apple Pay? So over-rated!

* You **really** don't want to make calls on the speakerphone, you just want to receive notifications, and that's it, you don't even want sound on those notifications.

* That flimsy plastic back on the Moto 360 is so okay, it will never crack and render you watch non-water resistant

* Don't even try to use a digital crown, it's so much better to don't have it. Force touch? Long-presses are so much faster!

* 45nm SOC is much better than the smaller and newer 28nm on the Apple Watch

* You want to wear your leather band at all the times, there's really no need to quickly change to a rubber band, for exercise, for example, you are going to the gym with a rubber band

* ""Is that a Moto360?"", people are always asking me that.

* Not having the option to use with with WiFi network is not a big deal, not having custom watch faces at version 1.0, that's a big deal!

* Always loosing Bluetooth? That's a thing that never happens on Android Wear! Don't listen to people!

* This is no damage control at all, that 12 hour battery life ""myth"" totally fake: https://plus.google.com/+MarquesBrownlee/posts/T3ySTAjpyLe"
5899,"It's an Apple Watch, and Apple Watch only site.

"
5900,"He's charismatic and good looking. His videos are easy to understand and well made. When he's talking about Android, he actually does know quite well what he's talking about. "
5901,"> Plenty of mistakes all the time

That's why."
5902,"> Why do people like him so much? 

Because he's the messiah for the Apple-hater kids.

He tells people what they want to hear in the first place.

He's obviously catering to people who don't like or didn't had bought smartwatches.

Smartwatches suck, and the Apple Watch is the only one you want to buy, because it's the only one that works in the real world, that pisses off iHater/Android fanboy crowd."
5903,Even Mossberg and Pogue give extremely opinionated reviews but they're usually in Apple's favour. 
5904,"Oh, so it's like the products he reviews? 

I'm starting to get over my consumerism. Sorry. "
5905,"I really do not get where you are coming from here. The criticism on this ""review"" is due to the fact that there is not a real conclusion made, it does not mention major features, and fails to talk about the product's design, all the while giving out false facts. 
If anything, the Apple community takes critism very well, and only insults critics when they are making errors in their review that anyone would point out, as it helps the reviewer, and tells others of the inaccuracies in the review.
Also, as a side note, what community do you think is better? Anyone can take a look at the latest android reviews on the verge, and can see a collective shit-fit that the verge is ""biased"" towards Apple, and say that their reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. Meanwhile, they didn't give the Apple Watch that great of a review, and give other products fair tries, despite their many short comings."
5906,"What we *want* is a base level of competence. At *least* do the research to get the basic technical facts right and cover all of the key features of the device. If you can't be bothered doing either of those, then why bother at all?"
5907,[deleted]
5908,"His Moto 360 review was pretty good, but this one didn't go into any depth outside of explaining the features. And crucially, he got a number of facts wrong. Mainly the pixel density and screen technology (the two things he always cares most about), and thinking that all apps (including native) run off the iPhone."
5909,"> I'm currently testing a moto 360 and the AW sport at the same time and agree with MKBHD overall conclusions. Rigjt now smart watch technology is simply not there yet.

So, the back has cracked yet?

Hows that 205 dpi vs 326 dpi?

The leather band is any good for sports?

And that monster size? Isn't that ""almost too big""?

Etc. etc. etc..."
5910,Never skip ~~leg~~ forearm day.
5911,He has got the most dainty wrists. 
5912,"For a lot of these kids reviewing the Apple Watch, their only experience with watch fashion are the gigantic Android Wear devices like the Moto 360. So when they see one that is a more normal size they think it's ""small."""
5913,"""But the Moto 360 is the same size as any normal men's watch!""

No it isn't. "
5914,[deleted]
5915,"Mkbhd has never really done good reviews, he just tells you the specs and a few quircks about the device and that's it 

Never go to him if you want a review "
5916,"> instead you get nothing more than a list of features

Exactly what the MKBHD video is **not**.

After saying ""it's too little for $700"", then he **completly** evaded Apple Watch's most important features. And evaded explaining why it's $700, why did he chose a Dutch leather band? Sapphire crystal screen? etc..."
5917,[deleted]
5918,"He nada corrected note at the top saying AMOLED. Also that's very pedantic.Apple Pay is not exclusive to the watch. The phone does it just fine. Not really a selling point. It was a fine review, just because folks didn't agree with his opinion doesn't make it less valid."
5919,"I HAVE owned an iPhone 2G, 3G, iPad, iPad 2, and New iPad as well as owned for a couple days *and returned* the Apple Watch. I splurged for the Sport model. It's slow. The accelrometer and gyroscope are MUCH WORSE than my SW3, and the navigation is confusing at best. Sorry but Google and Pebble nailed what a smartwatch needs to be and what it shouldn't be. Apple took the Samsung approach, threw everything at the wall, and hoped SOMETHING worked well enough to sell the device. We need to face facts that in terms of usability, features and stability, Apple failed with this one. It's one of the first Apple products I've actually returned."
5920,"I own a moto 360 and AW sport, neither feels complete to me. I feel like a psaying beta tester"
5921,"To be fair, he uses Apple products on the daily and you can see them in his videos."
5922,I think his reviews of the iPhone 6 and 6+ were both positive. Even the 5s
5923,"He was positive on the MacBook, and, although he pointed the problems with the iP6, he was generally positive. His bias is not so bad, and in fact, I think he was on point in his AW review. 


Sure, it's good. It just isn't that great."
5924,6 and 6+ were very positive.
5925,"Most because Apple doesn't really experiment, and it can't because only 1 new phone every year.

If the iPhone was an Android phone, outside of the finger print sensor it'd fall into the crowd on the specs sheet.

However the iPhone excels at everything it does, one of the best camera, screen, speed, design, build quality.

Every review could read

""Still fantastic all around. This is new""

And it'd tell you everything you need to know"
5926,"He's an Android user and enthusiast, he wasn't even interested in the Apple Watch but Apple invited him to the event. "
5927,He's got good production value an has managed to create a strong brand. However as a tech reviewer he doesn't have a distinct voice among reviewers asides from an odd obsession with 4k and pixel density. It's not like his reviews are particularly enlightening or be overly critical of a product.
5928,"As much as I agree with your points, MKBHD actually stated how he got the sapphire panel. In the video he says ""Thanks, again, to Sonny Dickson for hooking me up with these parts"""
5929,"I agree completely.

It's decent cinematography with a recitation of a spec sheet.  Probably why he was a good fit for The Verge.

I also notice he doesn't like Apple in a very close-minded  kind of way. "
5930,"Nah, I'm with you on this. These YouTube reviewers all strike me as someone who has all these tech gadgets but all they use them is to do more tech reviews. It's like a spec war, because he can afford to shoot in 4k that makes the review better? I'm not hating on the guy himself (or these other reviewers per se) but I don't get the impression he'd make something other than tech review videos with their overpowered setups. It's a business and they need to keep a business going but I would love to hear from filmmakers what an iPhone or other phone camera does for them. Don't regurgitate the spec sheet, show us how you'd use it outside of a tech bubble."
5931,"> That and he managed to snag one of the sapphire iPhone 6 panels before the GT Advance collapse,

It turns out that wasn't sapphire, but just the regular gorilla glass screen the iPhone 6 shipped with. He proved it himself later on by comparing its scratch resistance with the known-sapphire covered TouchID sensor and they weren't the same. He (and everyone else) just assumed it was sapphire because all the rumors said it was going to have a sapphire screen."
5932,"Who says the panel was sapphire? He just said it's the rumored sapphire display, and it ""seems pretty strong"". 

All iPhone screens are ""pretty strong"". "
5933,"Yeah I think the sad problem with people like him, Lou, mark gurman, sonny, etc is that no one is questioning how they get their information or parts. They are clearly doing something that is illegal. We just don't have solid proof or we don't want to accuse young kids or whatever but bribery, purchasing stolen parts/ software / trade secrets/ etc. 

I feel like I'm going to be killed for suggesting the rumor mill is immoral but a good % of people freaked out when someone else phone was hacked, and now people are likely hacking and buying secrets and profiting off that - but nah that's totally fine. "
5934,I don't care much for MKBHD either. He comes off quite smug and he seems like an android fanboy to me.

5938,"> Also, as a side note, what community do you think is better? 

Without hesitation the /r/gunpla community is the best reddit has to offer. You have people who have been building for 20+ years, people who just started, people who build with just their hands and people who are proffesional builders all with the same mindset: ""Have fun building the best model kit you can"". 

Now to answer your question with a bit more revelance I think its /r/Android. Now before you downvote me please here me out it comes down to one simple concept = **Choice allows people to be more critical.**  The problem with /r/apple /r/AppleWatch  /r/Nexus  /r/AndroidWear  is this mentality of ""If you don't like it don't buy it"" that comes when there is only a single option available.  Yes you see this on /r/android from the Nexus fanboys but overall people on that subreddit just want the best phone that meets their needs. People slammed samsung for losing expandable memory and the removable back, but once the phone came out these were mitigate due to the decent battery life, wireless charging and 128gb option.

5947,He uses a Mac Pro because even /r/pcmasterrace would agree that it's a very good value for money for the components. It just shows that he isn't a hater whose vision is entirely clouded. He has never tried putting in any real effort trying to understand the Apple ecosystem because he's forced to please his fanbase. 
5948,"Maybe he's ""on point"", but I was kind of hoping for more than one point in a ""definitive review,"" which is the problem."
5949,Related to that: Apples update policy also directly counters the livelihood of professional reviewers. They literally need new gadgets to review or they couldn't make a video. So one phone a year is not really exciting for them and they gravitate toward platforms with more flux.

5958,"I would give The Verge more credit. They've been aiming to be a ""tech lifestyle"" news site, and they haven't been the best at communicating that beyond aesthetics. Nor have they explained that their review system is not intended to be objective. It's a subjective scale, like Ebert's reviews: 4-stars for one movie doesn't mean another 4-star is the same quality. Instead the top star-rating, or in the Verge's instance, 10.0 (100) point scale is a measure of a product's objective and how well it achieves that objective. But they never explain it clearly."

5961,"Actually I believe that the ""sapphire"" panel that the iPhone 6 was supposed to have was a sapphire/glass composite and not sapphire crystal, so to compare to sapphire crystal would not be accurate. The comparison would have to be made between the production part MKBHD acquired and the same part on a publicly released iPhone. Whatever MKBHD had in his earlier video is not what the 6 released with (ion-x). What the public got with ion-x was more fragile glass because of the GT Advance problem.

And besides that, he still acquired a part that got him a lot of hits, and a lot of money, and that part could only really be gained by 1. it was given directly from Apple to push a story 2. He somehow obtained a part taken from an Apple contractor."
5962,"Because I have one and you start realizing that being it other way, it would just suck.

90% of people with negative opinions are either

a) not interested in smartwatches at all

b) Android die-hard fanboys

c) people pissed because in all android watches, there's not a single one with so many rights, and so few wrongs, those rights/wrongs aren't apparent when you look in a uninterested way, but when you look in ""i'm going to buy"", point of view.

"
5963,"They do, but those two always gloss over anything that is negative as if it's nothing and praise Apple anyway. They're just as biased as this reviewer but because it works in Apple's favour you're okay with it... That's all I was pointing out. "
5964,"Downvotes don't prove what you think they prove. Stop acting like they make you a martyr for your ideas. 

As someone who spends most of their time on /r/android, you comments just seem random rather than supporting an idea.

"
5965,">you can't even add custom face watches. For a product that is supposed to be very personal this is ridiculous.

Have patience. Apple has *always* been conservative, restricting as much as is feasible and then relaxing those restrictions as time passes and (importantly) APIs are refined and tested. They also err on the side of a good user experience over customisability - and on a device with a tiny battery and an OLED screen, custom watch faces are a definite user experience hit.

It is easier for them to grant more freedoms later than take them away, and this is how they have been operating since the iPhone in 2007. The lack of third party watch faces is not unusual, likely not permanent and should not be a surprise. It is certainly not ridiculous after less than a month after the watch was released.

I, myself, are waiting for third party complications, but I am happy to let them finalise the API before allowing them."

Most of the process for him is use the device and film throughout rather than use, think, reflect, write. Most of him ""testing"" is actually on film.

Then don't be patient and spend it elsewhere.

>why should I be a paying beta tester while they work out the kinks

You are misrepresenting my comments. The API is what needs refinement and testing but that only of use to developers, not users. You are not beta testing the API - only Apple is.

>It doesn't take a lot of resources to let me.choose a background picture.

On the contrary, with an OLED screen it can take significantly more battery power. And I bet that if Apple did allow third party clockfaces, you - and others - would be complaining about the battery life instead. Alternatively, of course, they could make the watch larger and get a bigger battery. However, that would omit a large proportion of the people in the world, including most women and including me with my skinny wrists.

Apple has made certain tradeoffs. They looked at three disadvantages and chose the one that meant the watch would be usable by more people and functional as a watch all day. That is a valid and defensible choice. It just doesn't happen to be the one you wanted. Well, okay, if you don't like the Apple Watch and don't like the specific tradeoffs Apple has made, don't buy one. It's that simple."

- You don't need to swipe your finger. A touch will do.
- The scan is at 500dpi.
- The scan goes beneath the top layer of skin.
- The sensor is capacitive and requires a living finger (or some cleverness).
- A small charge is delivered to your finger by the metal ring to increase the sensitivity of the scan.
- It works on people who do not have readable fingerprints with other technology. For example, my wife.

6012,He uses Macs... He (like me) prefers Android for mobile. He doesn't dislike Apple at all though. Just because someone doesn't give an Apple product a glowing review doesn't mean he hates Apple though. 
6013,"Name one objective advantage of the Moto360, then...

"
6014,"They're two different design mentalities. Android's design mentality is (and always has been) to give users all of the options so they can make their own choices, even if some of those are bad. Apple's design philosophy is to limit the choices to a small set of heavily designed and vetted options, but if you don't like what you see than you're SOL.

So, do you want choice or curation?

It sounds like you want choice. It's no surprise, then, that you prefer android products.

I personally, want curation. Because I have no interest in digging through piles and piles of bad designs just to get to the one I want. Apple is great for me.

Your opinion is that Apple should have more watch faces, and you use your personalized watch face as an example of why it's good. I look at your watch face and think it looks tacky (I don't want a Goldeneye reference on my wrist), and I see why Apple took the approach they did."
6015,">This is such a closed minded view of technology.

As opposed to your stance, which can be summarised as ""Apple should pander to my preferences and no one else's"".

> Apple knows right

I didn't say that. I said ""Apple made these choices and this is why"".

>I dont deserve this option.

No. Apple does not offer this option. If you want this option, you can buy a watch elsewhere. This is how markets work.

> give the user that option and let them decide if its worth the tradeoff.

That would be fine if they knew the tradeoff existed. However, most people do not know there is more than one type of screen, let alone that one is called OLED, let *alone* that OLED drains more battery the more pixels are on. 

No, what would happen is that everyone would play around with fancy screens and then complain that the battery life sucks."
6016,So a very good finger print sensor got it.
6017,He even said that the iPhone is the most polished device out there and he recommends it the most to people who ask him what phone to get. 
6018,"Still.  I remember in the iPad Air review, he complained about iOS not being like an Android or PC, despite the hardware.

I'm not saying he's biased.  I'm saying he's overrated and shallow like typical Youtube reviewers, but he has a nice camera.



"
6019,"Not claiming bias as much as not getting Apple. 

I just think he's good at spitting out spec sheets while using an nice camera.

"
6020,"Software: I can set a custom watchface

Hardware: bigger battery "
6021,Yep. And a TV is just a small cinema screen. Never mind the vast gulf in the applied technologies. They're practically identical.
6022,"So... Deal breaker...

Who cares if it has a ""bigger battery""? (Than the 38mm)

Does it have a 1000 cycle battery? It has a more power hungry SOC, doesn't last even for a day!"
6023,"God, stop it already lol"
6024,"I came from an S2, to a S7 and wow, what a jump. The screen, the sensors, to even just the look was a crazy difference. I also went from 42mm to 45mm and it actually fit better for me. The new Midnight color is also black, which I prefer over the space gray. IMO it's worth it to get the better technology, but it's not that different from the 6, so if you want to save $100 go for the 6, or even the SE if you don't need the sensors."
6025,"i personaly just got a 6 because it was on sale and the 7 was to expensive. and from what i can tell they r pretty similar. 7 has faster charging, is a lil bigger, stronger front glass, and that's abt it i belive. so to me those things were not worth $130 more"
6026,"I had a S3, but traded up to a S4 and the difference was night and day.  I'm tempted with a S7 as well but will probably stick with my S4 as the feature gap between it and the S4 (IMO) isn't that big.  If you really think you'll use an Apple Watch then I would go for the S7 as you'll definitely notice the difference coming from a S3."
6027,"you're not getting anything worthwhile over the Series 6, or even the Series 5 for that matter."
6028,"‚ÄúWorth it‚Äù is pretty subjective. It sound like you didn‚Äôt get much out of a series 3 and there‚Äôs not much that the series 7 does over the series 6 (or even the series 5). Definitely don‚Äôt get the series 3 either way, that‚Äôs way too old now, but you could pick up a pretty good condition series 5 or 6 used (or even new in box).

But if you didn‚Äôt like the watch before, I‚Äôm not sure what you would be getting out of it a second time around."
6029,"Think back to why you sold your Series 3.  What were you using the Apple Watch for?

I personally believe the Series 7 is a fantastic Apple Watch but the price tag is out of my reach.  I was also looking at the SE, which I ended up getting to replace my Series 3, and what sold me on that was expandability.

Sure, you can buy a new 42mm Series 3 for $200 or less.  With the way Apple's software updates have been going, they are making it difficult to update the Series 3 to a new watchOS because of the limited amount of space on the watch.  The Series 6, Series 7, and SE all have 32GB of space while the Series 3 only has 8GB.  Come OS update time you're possibly looking at having to delete stuff off the Series 3 watch, unpairing, pairing, and updating.  Pain in the ass."
6030,Go for a series 5 or a SE
6031,Well I would have to disagree with some of the comments here I went from a series 5 to a series 7 with cellular on the new seven series and the screen size makes a huge difference in particular for a 40 year old man who is struggling with seeing things up close. The fast charging is brilliantly better than on my series 5 I could not be happier with my purchase and the upgrade from 5 to 7
6032,I just upgraded from a aw5 to a 7. My husband got it for me as a Xmas Present. Only reason I upgraded was because the 40mm screen was ro small for me. I don‚Äôt have the best eyes and it was super hard to read notifications. Now with 45mm 7 I have no problem! I also love the keyboard I use it to text a lot.
6033,"S3 to S7 was worth it just for the extra watch faces alone, but the bigger screen size is a nice bonus. S4 already had some of the better faces so you may be alright if it isn‚Äôt that important to you."
6034,">I had a S3, but traded up to a S4 and the difference was night and day.  I'm tempted with a S7 as well but will probably stick with my S4 as the feature gap between it and the S4 (IMO) isn't that big.

I did try it on in store, but it was hard to tell from my perspective so I just trusted a third point of view. Heard that the screen is also bigger so I guess that‚Äôs a good plus too"
6084,That looks great. Thank you. I have one more question.. have you tried on different watch faces on the red? Do they seem unfit if the colours don‚Äôt match the redness of the watch? For example - the contour face with numbers in yellow. I want to go for red but am hesitant because of its versatility.
6085,"I had the 41mm for a while. When I switched to 44mm, it‚Äôs was much better. Also, If you want to use the keyboard future, 45mm will be way more comfortable for that."
6086,I can show you different watch faces. Which ones did you want to see
6087,Oh yeah the new qwerty keyboard could definitely be good with the 45 mm
6088,As contrasting as they can be. Like California face with blue or yellow as the background colour.

6091,Yes yes. That‚Äôs exactly what I wanted to see. Somehow the red is toned down and doesn‚Äôt cancel out other colours.
6092,"Yes, the red case isn‚Äôt that prominent. The bands stand out more."
6093,"Except black, what all bands do you think it will look great, and not tacky?"
6094,"Tbh, I think all bands will look good on it except maybe green. The bands are really expensive so I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try different colors. Be wary of fakes, they can come off at any time."
