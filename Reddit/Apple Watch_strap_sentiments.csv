Sport loop for sure. The velcro closure makes it much more adjustable. The solo loop and braided loop are basically sized the same way as the sport band, so you'd have to choose the smaller size. I think that they're a little more forgivable fitting than the sport band, but you still may get annoyed by how tight it is.

Yes I think it isn’t there yet. Perhaps one running a meant-to-be-stand-alone OS (like a skinned Android) with a Bluetooth mini QWERTY keyboard would the issues I’ve highlighted. Sort of like a tiny blackberry with a wrist strap. At that point though I would glue one to the other and make a mini BB. But then you could just get a Jellyphone 2 at that point. 

One other consideration that popped up for me a few times is that it’s your phone on your wrist. If you are going to a formal event, it really stands out and makes you look like a SpyKid. I think most smartwatches will, the displays look too 2D to fool anyone that it’s not a ‘real’ watch (even with Always-On). I guess you could take off the straps and keep it in your pocket, but its so little and slippery it will end up flying into someone’s wine.",strap,negative

Another way is to log a workout, go to the Health app, and under Heart Rate you'll find ""Show All Data"". Most workout apps will mention your chest strap as the source.
