""This watch is basically a Series 6, but with a slightly larger display and slightly faster charge time.""

""This is now the most durable Apple Watch ever.""

""My disappointment with these new watches?  The color choices.  Apple doesn't offer a neutral color for the aluminum baseline Apple Watch.""",others
1,"It seems like most people who already have an AW are unimpressed by this update, but as somebody who is getting a series 7 as their first smart watch, can I just say I’m hype as hell for the fast charging and no bezels? I don’t even mind the colors that much, I went with midnight and I think it looks great",material
2,As someone who has a series 1 I’m definitely pumped! All of the reviews downplay it I think because the reviewers are techies that get review units each year. I will acknowledge I’m behind and it’s me that hasn’t updated. But I feel like we’re caught up in update culture. Where yes they could add more health features and a few more things but also the changes are so incremental because it’s such a good device in the first place.,material
3,"I imagine the space gray aluminum was the single most popular Apple Watch model. Getting rid of it was a pretty naked attempt at trying to force people into a SS or titanium, but I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out.",material
4,I am whelmed.,material
5,"Basically, it’s Apple Watch Series 6s?",material
6,Oh man does the green look great. It's a very dark almost army green and looks stunning in the videos. Incredibly happy I went with that over midnight (which looks black with a slight blue at certain angles in direct sunlight).,others
7,I'm still using Apple Watch 4. No motivation to buy that one. I will wait for a better update.,others
8,"I will say, seeing videos of the watches in natural light does help - the starlight looks about like how I expected in that champagne kind of color and the midnight and green are both a lot darker than I expected which is a pleasant surprise.",material
9,"Based on the videos, the midnight looks pretty black at first glance. You see the blue if you look at it carefully/in the right light. Might look different in person.",material
10,The keyboard is the seller for me,material
11,"I watched a couple of reviews and cancelled my preorder. Seeing it in real videos now, even with the thinner bezels it still just looks like the same watch which I’ve never loved the design of. My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign, but I still decided to put an order in. But the lack of neutral colours on lower end bands forced me to go for the milanese loop along with the stainless steel to get something I liked the look of, and at that price it simply isn’t worth it for me. I’ll wait for the series 8 to see if it has the new design and neutral bands.",others
12,"I have a day one series 3, and I think I might keep hanging on…",material
13,"If you have a Series 3 like me and were considering upgrading because of dreadful performance…. I strongly recommend installing watchOS 8.0.1 before ordering a new watch. 

It’s a major performance improvement and I’m now thinking of hanging on to this S3 for a little longer.",material
14,Waiting for another 38mm model. Or 36 w a full screen. These are just too bulky.,material
15,"Anyone who says this is an “S” year really doesn’t get how S models work.

The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is the literal opposite of an S year.",material
16,I DEMAND 120hz!!!,material
17,Even with these minor updates since last 2-3 years. AW is the best smartwatch and there is nothing even close. Shows you how other companies are far behind in the competition.,material
18,I wonder if it still works with the Belkin 3-in-1 Magsafe dock,material
19,"I’m debating on canceling my preorder after seeing these reviews. I’d be upgrading from a day one Series 4 with 80% battery health. 

I mainly upgraded so that I can have a good battery life again, get AOD and blood oxygen sensor. 

I’m seriously thinking of just getting a battery replacement and call it a year. It also doesn’t help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS.",material
20,I have a space gray S4. I was considering going to the S7 but no way am I paying for $800 for Space Black Titanium. Tim Apple has let me down on this one,material
21,"As an owner of a Series 6 Nike Edition watch, I'll be holding out for the future release that includes a blood glucose sensor.      With the cost of the sensors that you can wear for 14 days of continuous blood glucose monitoring, the Apple Watch series that does that feature will be well worth the upgrade.",material
22,Looks like I’m sticking with my series 1 for the time being 😅,material
23,"It's bizarre to me how much complaining there is about the Starlight and Midnight color options in this thread for a few reasons:

1) They're still super close to Silver and Space Grey. A hint of gold or blue does not make them ""not neutral,"" and anybody who isn't up on Apple color conventions is still going to look at them and think they look silver or dark grey. 

2) Why does it matter if they're neutral in the first place? You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. No, the Space Black Ti model is not going to look more professional/less gadgety than the Midnight Al.",others
24,Did anybody get the Gold SS (or any SS) review models?,material
25,No hands on with the blue?,material
26,Is the fast charging exclusive to the 7 or can I now buy a fast charger for my SE? Every once in a while I have my head up my ass ass and forget to charge when I have a good opportunity.,material
27,"I wonder if Apple will ever update the aluminum version of the apple watch with a sapphire display. My series 3 aluminum face is scratched to hell, but the massive increase in price to the steel/ceramic/titanium just seems not worth it.",material
28,"This is the 2nd apple device that I may upgrade too only because I regret my previous purchase. 


I got the iPhone 13 pro only because I regret getting the iPhone 12 with no telephoto lens, and I might get the series 7 only because I regret getting the SE with no always on display. Neither seem like enticing options if I made the correct choice with the 12 pro/series 6 last year.",material
29,so the s7 SiP is the same as the s6 SiP???,material
30,"I ordered one because It’s more trouble to buy a cheaper 6 from going to another country rather than get the 7 delivered to my door. 

First AW btw. I’ve only used it briefly for a week because a friend borrowed it to me so I can get a reference to compare it to the gwa2 I had.",material
31,I’m excited for my watch coming this Friday. Going to be upgrading from a Series 1!,material
32,Have a stainless with Milanese loop 45mm coming as my first Apple Watch. I’m very excited!! I don’t know too much about the features which makes me even more excited!,material
33,My new 7 is taking forever to charge and doesn’t hold a charge.  What chargers is everyone using and how long to charge?  15 mins?!  I wish!,material
34,So that whole announcement about it having really durable crystal across the board was a lie and it’s just glass and crystal on the stainless still?,material
35,"Well the hands on real world footage has shown clearly what I was worried about

The screen going so far edge to edge with such a curvy bit of glass looks weird

Looks to me like the screen is too big for the watch. The way the reflective edge obscures the display just doesn’t look all that great

The display no longer looks like its on top of the glass, it looks like its trapped behind the glass

And now I’m convinced that this will look great with a flatter redesign that I suspect we will get next year (if it wasn’t originally planned for this year)",material
36,"I mean just get a Series 6 which will probably discounted by retailers or off eBay. I got a series 5 stainless steel in January, heavily discounted and can see myself holding onto this for a while",others
37,"Yeh I also thought this with the “leaked” design, them squared edges don’t look like they’ll be too nice when bending my wrist. And yes before anyone mentions it, I know traditional, analog can watches have squared edges and are bulky",others
38,I don’t see them doing a flat design any time soon. The sensors would need to be completely redesigned to accommodate it. As it stands they protrude out the back of the watch significantly. They get away with it in part because of the curvature of the watch.,material
39,"The fifteen minutes of charging for 8 hours of sleep tracking does sound really nice, as I use my watch as a sleep tracker / alarm clock. Definitely feeling the upgrade pull from a series 3 to 7.",material
40,This is a good summary. That’s…basically it for changes.,material
41,"Coming from a wifi only Series 4, it’s a slightly better upgrade to the 7 cellular. Other than going for walks without my phone with me now, I doubt I’m going to be using it any differently.",material
42,Did I miss an incredibly small one-liner or did he not even address battery life?,energy
43,"Seems marques has been getting sloppy with the fact checking. He mentions you can dive with the watch because it has 5ATM water resistance.

Do NOT dive with it. I wouldn’t even use it for water sports like surfing. 5ATM basically allows for swimming in a pool and showering, doing more is risking it. If you want to do snorkeling you need at least 10ATM and for skin diving it should be 20ATM. 

Free and scuba diving are another beast and those watches need to pass a different certification (ISO 6425) so they are advertised with the word Diver’s before the rating.",others
44,Since when aren’t black and silver neutral colours?,others
45,"You’re definitely part of the target audience for the Series 7. I think people forget that for anyone thinking about upgrading from a Series 4 or older, this is a pretty significant upgrade.",material
46,Exactly the same here!,material
47,Same here! My first one. I'm only bummed by the removing of space grey color but i'll live with the midnight,material
48,"Very excited here as well! I am upgrading from an OG Galaxy Watch. I was a recent Android convert, and this will be my first Apple Watch. 

Looking forward to the integration and overall polish, as that was dearly lacking on the OG Galaxy Watch.",material
49,"I’m excited for mine, finally broke my series 2 a couple weeks ago",material
50,">no bezels

It's not like the Series 4, 5, SE, or 6 had much of a bezel to begin with.",material
51,"It's just like phones - it's an incremental upgrade from the previous generation, but it's really aimed at people who haven't upgraded for 2+ years.  For them, it's a large jump.",material
52,I mean I’m hyped as well upgrading from a Series 0 lmao…,material
53,"Yeah, I'm digging that midnight. Waiting for mine to arrive.

Up to everyone's taste 🤷🏻‍♂️",material
54,"Same here, I think all the people with recent watches are missing the point. The tech is mature enough that upgrading every year or two is pointless and wasteful.",material
55,You should see the screenshots and texts between me and my buddy.  We are very excited for midnight,material
56,Basically the Verge’s video conclusion lmao.,material
57,I’ll be coming form a S4. So there’s some new shit for me.,material
58,Your hype is totally justified! I jumped on the AW train last year with the S6 which was similarly received and I felt just as you described. I hope you love your new S7!,material
59,I wonder if they’ll also phase out silver and space grey on the new MacBooks (in favour of Starlight and Midnight). Currently I don’t think any of the recently refreshed products have any silver/space grey aluminum which is a bit odd.,material
60,"Removing neutral colors (black and white) from the base iPhone 13 lineup this year didn’t seem to slow down sales, even though they were probably the most popular colors.",material
61,"I’m sure they’ve calculated these losses go one they didn’t even need to build a new chipset. This, internally, is the same processor then the S6. That’s where most of the money in R&D goes, and they didn’t need to spend a single dollar this year on making it better.",material
62,"The only reason I bought a model other than the aluminum was for the sapphire screen. In hindsight, it was worth it, but I wish they would let all models have the sapphire rather than just the premium",material
63,"> I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out  

Yeah right now I'm waiting to see if any S6 deals are on the go (UK) or go cheapsies on the SE. Was more than happy to go in on the big new thing but what a jip.  

Edit: None have seemingly dropped from the current price that I've seen yet but likely will once they get S7 stock...",material
64,"probably. i know i have no interest in buying a *heavier* and less shatter/crack resistant Watch just to get a color i like when that Watch is also more expensive and whose main purpose is fitness tracking.

but also, the only reason i'd replace my Series 5 with a 7 is if the battery degrades sufficiently to bug me and i can't wait for a Series 8 or whatever. there's just not anything exciting about the 7 to me.",material
65,"I'm sure you're right, but I'm still using a Series 4 and I have to say the improvements on the Series 7 seemed like a good enough jump for me.  Nicer/more durable screen, fast charging, and brighter always on display (which I have yet to experience on an Apple Watch) sold me on it.  

They didn't have the exact color I wanted, but for me the hardware updates and features matter more",others
66,"Of the three people who I know who have apple watches, they’re all getting midnight and are excited after todays pics and videos",others
67,I doubt it. Some of these colors are REALLY neutral. Heck apparently the very green one is more or less gray in anything but ideal lighting.,others
68,Don’t think apple will ever bring space Grey back for any of their products. It’ll be more of graphite. A darker shade. I’ll expect MacBook Pro to follow suit. Basically all of the pro products will have similar colour range. AW SS imo falls under the pro range,material
69,This is definitely one of the Apple Watches ever released,material
70,4s^3,material
71,"Ehh I'd only expect spec bumps for an S. 20% larger screen, faster charging but no spec bump is... it's own minor thing.",others
72,and it's not like the Series 6 was anything more than a Series 5 with a gimmicky Spo2 sensor.,others
73,"No. S years are by definition the same external design and more major internal improvements. 

The Series 7 is the opposite of this: new external design and lesser overall improvements.",material
74,"Given the iPhone 6S was one of the most comprehensive internal revamps of all time, not exactly relevant.",others
75,"Same here. I can’t figure out why the green isn’t more popular. I got the clover solo loop but man, the black bands paired with the green watch sure look great.",material
76,"I wasn’t complaining, I missed preorder by far, but green was still available for day 1 store pickup by midday.",material
77,What’s the battery health on your S4?,material
78,I’m definitely getting the series 8 if my watch makes it to then.,material
79,I broke my Apple Watch 4 a couple months ago and have no motivation to buy this. The incremental watch updates are killing me.,material
80,"I’m totally happy with the physical design of it, but there’s nothing this year that makes it a worthwhile upgrade. For me, the two biggest things that I’d be excited for are either a significant upgrade to battery life, or some new health-tracking features enabled by new hardware. Anything else is kinda “well I guess a slightly larger screen is nice but not $400 nice”.",material
81,"> My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign

I just cannot understand the logic behind wanting redesigns on things just for the sake of having them redesigned... It's a smart watch with an extremely limited form factor, what are you expecting? Will square sides chuff your bits?",material
82,Hard edge Apple Watch would suck for working out / sports,material
83,"Same, cancelled and ordered couple new bands instead to clench that consumer thirst",material
84,"Series 3 gang 😎 I’ll be honest I haven’t really been tempted by any of the EKG or blood O2 stuff in the new ones, seem kinda gimmicky. I think I’ll be rocking the 3 for a while",material
85,Same,material
86,"Same. When this was announced I was all in. Then as time went on, the shiny idea went away and my s3 still does what I need and doesn’t cost me $800. Gonna use that to replace my aging iMac",material
87,Yeah I agree. I cleared everything and installed 8.0.1 and it feels like a new watch somehow. I’m still going to check out my ss series 7 when it comes in for a week then make my decision.,material
88,"> The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is not the official definition though. And no one is calling it the ""S"" model like it is an official thing. 

> This is the literal opposite of an S year.

The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature. None of those really apply here.",others
89,“ but I need something new and drastic every year!!!!!!”,material
90,I think all of us that use an analog watch face agree that its ridiculous that we don't have 120Hz or higher yet. Watching the second hand move on my current Apple watch only compels me to stab my eyes out with an Apple Pencil.,material
91,It does it just doesn’t fast charge.,material
92,"If you’re able to, couldn’t you get a Series 6? I just got one, it’s a great device and one that could last me a few generations. I imagine the series 6 will do the same for you.",material
93,Same boat as you. Might end up canceling my preorder as well.,material
94,"As I have a series 4, I cancelled my series 7 pre-order that would have been arriving this Friday. I think I can be patient enough for another few generations.",material
95,"I had a steel Series 4 with 75% battery health, and right after the Series 7 was announced I was on the phone with Apple to get a battery replacement.

Now I’ve got a Series 4 with a fresh battery that looks brand new (so shiny without all the scratches!) and I couldn’t be happier with my decision.

I’ll probably upgrade next year if the Series 8 gets those rumoured new health sensors. AOD would be cool too.",others
96,">It also doesn’t help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS

From what I've seen the reviews, Midnight honestly [looks closer to black](https://i.redd.it/xc3cprrt19t71.jpg) than Space Gray ever did. It has a slight blue sheen in certain lighting, but it's super subtle to the point where black bands match it better than the Midnight ones.

It's almost making me regret getting black Ti, but I still think that also looks great so I'm going to keep it for now.",material
97,I mean the “graphite” stainless steel model seems pretty black to me,material
98,…so get aluminum…?,material
99,what would they have to add to entice you? curious,material
100,"Fair play. I went from S1 to S4 and it was a big jump, but every year since has been underwhelming. 

Not that I know what I want from a smart watch these days. Maybe just battery, everything is fine.",material
101,"> You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. 

I don't think the problem is embracing whether they are trying to hide the fact that they have an Apple Watch or not. The problem is how well the colors go with your bands, outfits, and ""lifestyle"". A neutral watch is likely to blend with their choices. 

A red Apple Watch will not go with how I dress for work, or socially. It won't even match half the bands I bought for my space gray watch. So while I really like the color, I won't get that color.",material
102,">	Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like.

The colour that I like is no longer available. That’s the problem.",others
103,"I think this is just all wild speculative whining driven by the absence of being able to hold a watch in your hand and having to go by product images online. As soon as they're released, I expect very few actual complaints in real world use.

I've been a participant in this before: When every Apple 'news' site broadcasted that the MagSafe Duo was possibly incompatible with the iPhone 13 Pro I was aghast and fretting over it. Only to receive the phone and charge it every night on it without any issue. Not exactly the same, but its no point in getting so worked up over something until you actually have it in your hand.",others
104,It looks like everyone has been getting the green one for their reviews so far.,material
105,"Yep, 7 only",material
106,The sapphire is more scratch resistant but also heavier and more brittle (prone to shattering). The ion-glass is much better for the “sports/fitness” model.,material
107,"I know it adds a little bulk, but the there are so many bumper styles out for for super cheap.  I’d highly recommend; they’ve saved my A3 on dozens of occasions.",others
108,Yes,material
109,"I agree it looked that way, but if you take a close look at the watch when it's on your wrist, it's really the sensor on the bottom that has contact on your skin, not the edges of the watch. In fact, short of bending my wrist straight up, I can't even get myself to contact the sides.  That's just to say that I think the more angular design wouldn't be an issue in practice.",material
110,"Oh if you have a series 3 there’s no question you should upgrade. 

Also Tommy rules!",material
111,"True, but saying only “slightly larger display” doesn’t really imply the functional upgrade of the revised UI to go with it that can show 50% more text on screen, and has a keyboard etc.

For me, being able to read messages/emails that are 50% longer without having to bring up my other hand to scroll through them is a pretty important upgrade.",material
112,I was looking forward to more. Series 8?,material
113,"He did address battery life, it’s the same.",energy
114,He mentions battery life in the video.,material
115,"he addressed on battery and recharge 

while battery life is the same. quick charge fits his life style much better",energy
116,"there's not anything new there really. battery life is the same as it's always been ('fine' to 'mediocre' depending on how you use the Watch), but it charges faster so you can just do a quick charge at night or in the morning if you find some benefit to sleep tracking and be fine.",material
117,Also watch your bands. I used a sports band and jumped off a rock about 10 feet up and lost my watch on impact (on the second jump). The river was not clear and it was lost forever.,material
118,There is no black aluminum. The midnight version has a blue tint to it.,material
119,[deleted],others
120,"Coming from a SS series 4, I’m pretty excited for the upgrade.",material
121,"This!
I’ve got a 3, so this would be a gigantic upgrade. Wouldn’t be bummed at all.",material
122,"Exact same as you, going to try and order friday since I missed preorder timeline for friday pickup",material
123,Same I’m excited - also getting my first cellular model,material
124,"Oddly, the new iPad mini has Starlight and Space Grey.",material
125,"I doubt they'd do that. Maybe we'll see MacBooks come in color options similar to the iMacs, but I don't think they're going to release new colorways to match watches. The watch is unique among Apple offerings because it's a fashion accessory as much as it is a tech product. The people who think all Apple products should be color-matched are looking at it the wrong way, imo. The watches need to be matched with clothing, not MacBooks.",others
126,"At least you can (and most likely do) put a cover on a phone, with the watch you're stuck with what you've got.",material
127,"For me the color matters much more for a watch than a phone. You’re likely not putting a case on it, and it’s part of your outfit.",material
128,"If it’s about the durability of the display, I’ve been buying some cheap glass screen protectors for my aluminum AWS6 from AliExpress that use LOCA and a UV light. Very sleek and since it’s glass I’ve found I don’t notice it if you put it on right.

Obviously not as premium as sapphire crystal, but my wrist is at the perfect height to bang into doorknobs and my quartz countertops - sometimes it’ll crack but then I just replace the protector. Could be an option for people more budget -minded (read: cheap) like myself lol",material
129,I’n from NL and found a 40mm Series 6 on Amazon for 299 a few weeks ago. That was enough reason for me the take the S6 and not wait for the S7. Best choice ever after seeing these reviews.,material
130,"4s^3 is impossible, it should be 4s^2 3d^1",material
131,Apple Watch Series 6 Pro Max,material
132,">I can’t figure out why the green isn’t more popular

The answer to the question ""Why isn't x color more popular"" when it comes to fashion accessories is pretty simple. Most colors outside of black, white, gold, and brown just don't go together nicely with most people's clothing choices, and this green color on the Series 7 looks like it unfortunately falls into that camp.

Never mind the fact that conventional mechanical watches are almost always found in those colors as well.",others
133,"I went in 50/50 between green and midnight but I ended up looking in my closet to make up my mind. The green would work with my weekend clothes but it’s just not right for my black, blue, and gray heavy business attire, and (rather unfortunately) I’m in the business clothes many more hours than my casual clothes during the Monday through Friday time period when I’ll actually need to use a watch. Still would have preferred graphite to match my 13 Pro but I’m staying open minded about the midnight.",material
134,My S4 that I got replaced in Feb 2019 is at 85%,material
135,How about 400 minus what you get from selling your 6 ?,material
136,I’m with you.  Plus I don’t want a mini iPhone looking thing on my wrist.  The current Apple Watch looks amazing and does not need a redesign,material
137,"The only way to chuff my bits is by putting the apple watch inside the seiko 5, sorry not sorry",material
138,"It’s important to me that it looks good, and for me the rumoured redesign was a significant aesthetic improvement over the current design.",material
139,"I’m on an s4 so I have those, and yeah, totally minor things. The only reason I’m even entertaining updating is I’ve been dying for the always on screen, and my watch is getting fairly beat up after years of daily use… but I don’t like the colors of the aluminum and would never go to the stainless, and the idea of buying last years product when it’s still so expensive just seems wrong to me.

I really wanted to upgrade, but everything about this watch feels like a minor revision, and that they plan for something much more significant next year. And if not, well, we’ll see…",material
140,">The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature.

TouchID was a pretty valuable feature. And as far as redesigns go, it's S7 is probably more substantial than going from iPhone 6S to 7 was. Same with XS to 11.",material
141,"Not saying it’s a definition, but that’s always how S models worked.

3GS identical to 3G
4S identical to 4
5s near identical to 5, with home button changed for Touch ID 
6s identical to 6
XS identical to X

It would make more sense to call the S6 “Series 5s” than to call Series 7 a “Series 6s”",material
142,"Gotcha, thanks! It wasn’t listed underneath the dock’s compatibility section on Belkin’s website and I saw a post on here a few weeks ago inquiring the same thing",material
143,I might just get a Stainless Steel Series 6 to be honest. Good idea!,material
144,What's the price diff?,material
145,Did they replace the screen too when you got the battery replaced or have you just taken really good care of yours? I'm debating cancelling my order but the scratch in my series 4 has been bothering me for a couple years now and going to the sapphire glass would be nice.,material

Fair enough! Worth mentioning that one of these options is used though and probably won't come with the same warranty and might not be in the same condition or have the same battery health.

I mean they were pretty clear that the extra room for text was the result of the UI being redesigned, not *just* because the screen is larger. They had a whole section of the presentation dedicated to that UI redesign.

I also kind of doubt that the reason they didn't cram more text in before was simply to sell us on a larger screen 3 years later.

-tracking workouts is super easy and you can even swim with it on ( I do this all of the time)

- timers on your wrist so when you need a timer fast it’s right there

-can change songs from my wrist 
- can see my heart rate at all times ( I get panicky sometimes and it spikes so I like to be able to see it and calm myself down)

At least when looking at sub-1000$ watches, they all loose most of their value in the used market, compared to the new value. Apple watches are far from expensive as far as watches go, but have a very different kind of market and I don't think they should be compared to classic watches.",others

They might have the same pack shape for manufacturing simplicity but there's no way it's sitting on that much extra range without being paid for. The upgrades are full self driving and a soft lock on some 0-60 performance for the AWD non performance models. That software lock does NOT get it all the way up to the performance model, it only unlocks residual performance from the motors. The rear motor is >200hp on its own (though the torque is software restricted at low speed to avoid torque ripple effects), but adding the (more powerful, no ripple effects) front motor only brings it up to about 350hp. The $2k power bump unlocks the missing chunk given the limitations of the long range model as is, and the actual Performance model has some additional stuff (though the motors are, at their core, the same) to provide the last bit of performance, my guess would be some improved materials to keep up reliability with all the extra torque.

There was one point in time where the model S was selling 70kwh models that actually had 80kwh batteries, but that was for two reasons: They'd stopped making the 70kwh battery pack, and restricting the 80kwh battery to 70kwh usable actually improved usable life (and it wasn't NEARLY as big a jump as the current model 3 standard->long range models).

Also, agreed on the hype and marketing. But you can be sure this hype and marketing would Not have worked with an esthetically un pleasing watch.

Also, visual comparisons between transreflective and OLED screens say otherwise against your statement that ""they look just as good"". You were probably right if you compared a transreflective display against one of the first smartwatches in the market with incredibly dim and poorly color accurate LCD and TFT displays (looking at you LG Watch first Gen, and first Gen Sony Smartwatch), but modern smartwatches have gotten crazy bright and good. And transreflective displays simply can't hold a candle to them. Just take a look at this comparison of Garmin watches using OLED and transreflective displays
https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-venu-vs-garmin-vivoactive-4-7826

The transreflective one makes blacks look like grays, and colors look dull and flat. Giving it a near sticker like appearance. 

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying transreflective screens are bad. In fact, I still use my pebble time from time to time when I go to the office and even get some complements on it. It's nice forgetting to even charge it for weeks. But if there's an important gathering or I'm going out, I'll always wear my Galaxy Watch with its gorgeous display that can show an adecuate watch face for the occasion fitting my outfits colors with great color accuracy.

Because whether we like it or not, we must accept smartwatches took off because they became in part, a fashion accessory. With functionality second. 

Does that mean transreflective displays are bad? Absolutely not. I'm just trying to see why they didn't take off with the mainstream market. And why what success they've had, are with niche audiences of power users that are the rare kind of people that do value functionality over looks, like you and me.",material

But to answer your question, aluminium can corrode. The aluminium on the apple watch is probably anodized, so it is already corroded to begin with (controlled corrosion which is also dyed for the colour). The more corroded it gets, the slower it corrodes further (unlike steel which just corrodes constantly, aluminium corrosion is a protective layer).

In some circumstances aluminium can get a very agressive corrosion which is quite nasty (e.g. in salt water, alloy boat engines can corrode badly... maybe something similar on a tiny scale can occur on your hand too, with salty sweat...).",others

As one Redditor below so happily pointed out, I don’t know what technology Apple is using for theirs (“Reflectance” pulse oximetry, upon further research, perhaps; I don’t really care because I’d never buy this junk) as the typical oximeters shoot light in ~~both directions~~ two different wavelengths (I misunderstood, apparently).

Based on the fact that this technology is not the industry standard (which is already fairly unreliable), and that Apple themselves have strictly stated that their watches *should not be used for medical purposes* (essentially opting out of any claim that they actually work), I’m comfortable assuming that it’s all marketing nonsense.

i.e. Don’t buy the watch solely because it has a toy pulse oximeter. It’ll be fun to play with, but it’s not a useful medical tool.

The apple watch sends you constant reminders, incentives and encouragement to close your ring, beat your target, and overall be more active. On top of that they also allow you to share this data with friends, so you compete to see who gets more points.

This is simple, but Apple did the difficult part. They perfected the balance between annoying and useful and made very smart decisions on which information to present. Active calories for example is a great ideal instead of total, or exercise only, because its abstract enough to cover everyday things like going up stairs but also skews towards exercise.

Then there are nice behind the scenes things. For example, the apple watch easily syncs with myfitnesspal so I can track my calorie goals and activity in the same place. The health app connects with my Withings scale, so it tracks my weight and body composition.

I'm extremely critical of the Apple Watch because it looks like trash, battery life is way too short (gotta charge it every day), and performance is meh. But I keep coming back to it.

Pulse oximetry most accurately measures capillary blood flow, which isn’t done reliably in the wrist.

2. Watch based oximeters wouldn’t act in the same way because there’s no detector on the other side of the wrist, so it might be a new technology. It would be difficult to compare the two oximeter types until the wrist kind is more mature.

Sure, it’s likely not as good of a sensor you’d use in a hospital but it’s a step in the right direction. People might not know how to read it.  That’s why you go see your doctor and let them interpret it. This use of smart watches is a great, maybe the best and most unanticipated use case for the smartwatch. A good thing that needs to be carefully encouraged and used, so long as people don’t use it in lieu of a medical professional but rather to assist them.

Like other sensors, the information is likely recorded over time by Apple’s Health app. Which also picks up info from my doctor’s office online medical records system for my review or use, and I believe the Health app can feed data the other way too, notably things like home BP readings, etc.  Not sure of that one, though. 

Assisting the docs is the key.

Seems like in general people forget about exchange rates a lot, when I see other Canadians or also Australians reading news from US sources, or about US made products. It can be confusing sometimes, considering we all use dollars, but anything you see online in reviews and such is probably in USD, so add a bit more to convert to Canadian and add a lot more to convert to Australian, basically. It'll usually equal out to be the same give or take a tiny bit.

Edit: I should note I'm talking from a Canadian perspective. I know in India, Apple devices cost marginally more, even when you convert it. I would chalk that up to shipping fees, considering India is a very competitive market. Apparently Australia has some problems like that too but I wouldn't know. The relatively small difference in price when you convert it is probably just because shipping and such (and also the fact that retailers use static prices, ie $599, where exchange rates change often, meaning price differences can grow or shrink). I'm just assuming mainly here.

Another edit: just an example I searched up. The S20 Ultra is $1399 regular price from Samsung directly. Here in Canada, it's like $1840 or $1850. That's the exact exchange rate.",material

*Apple’s latest watches do very few new things—but if you’re a first-time buyer or upgrading from a much older model, there’s a lot to consider
*
By | Photography by Kenny Wassus/The Wall Street Journal

/r/
What is most important to you in a smartwatch?

Sure, the top-of-the-line Apple Watch Series 6 can do that stuff but so can models that cost far less.

If you have already got a two- or three-year-old Apple Watch, the gains with this new model aren’t substantial. Same screen, same battery life, same core functionality. And I found this year’s standout health feature—a blood-oxygen sensor—not ready for prime time, not to mention not useful.

Plus, if you’re a first timer, or in need of an upgrade, Apple now has two other lower-cost options: the Apple Watch SE and Series 3. Actually, make that three: The best deal going right now might be a refurbished Series 5.

It is OK to be confused. I’m here for you. After testing all the models last week—along with the $330 Fitbit FIT 0.23% Sense—I have arrived at a new theory of Watch-Nomics: You should upgrade your Apple Watch every three to five years. Any sooner, and spending more on a watch doesn’t mean proportionally more features. So make the call on your needed features, then make a purchase.

The Choices

Remember your SAT multiple-choice tactics? Eliminate two choices and you suddenly have a 50/50 shot at a correct pick. Buying an Apple Watch is like that:


Do not collect them all! The Apple Watch Series 3, SE and Series 6, all on one wrist, from left to right.
A) Apple Watch Series 6 ($399): This one has the larger screen introduced in 2018, with an always-on display showing the time. It now has a slightly faster processor, slightly faster charging and the full health package, including an ECG electrical heart-rate sensor and new blood-oxygen sensor.

B) Refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 ($329): It’s basically a Series 6 without the blood-oxygen sensor. Apple stopped marketing it, but at time of publication, you could still find some variations in its refurbished store.

C) Apple Watch Series SE ($279): This resembles a Series 5 or 6, but without the always-on display, ECG or blood-oxygen sensor. It still has heart-rate tracking and notifications for high, low and irregular heart rate, as well as fall detection.

D) Apple Watch Series 3 ($199): OK, almost there. This one has an older design with a smaller screen, slightly shorter battery life and slower performance. It also has heart-rate tracking and heart-rate notifications, but no fall detection.

The Features

I anticipate most will choose A or C, especially if Apple runs out of refurbished Series 5s. So the real question is this: Are a blood-oxygen sensor, an ECG and an always-on display worth $120?

When I got the blood-oxygen sensor to work, most of my readings were in the healthy high-90% range. During a visit to my doctor, the watch even compared point for point with a medical-grade vital-signs monitor. However, often when I would manually initiate the 15-second test, I would get an “Unsuccessful Measurement,” indicating that the test didn’t work. Sometimes I would get a lower reading, like 94%—even when my trusty $45 Walgreen’s pulse oximeter said 99%.

The little disco ball of green and red lights on the back of the watch needs to be steady, flush and tight against the skin to get a reading. The new, wonderfully comfortable Solo Loop straps help with that, but apparently mine was a bit too loose. Sliding the watch up my wrist a bit more has improved this. Still, using this is far too unreliable and inaccurate—even if Apple doesn’t suggest this for medical use.


The Series 6 measures blood-oxygen levels, though not as reliably as a dedicated pulse oximeter.

Often after the 15-second blood-oxygen test, this ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" notification would appear. Sliding the watch up the wrist tended to fix the issue.
An Apple spokesman provided this statement: “The Blood Oxygen feature has been rigorously tested across a wide spectrum of users and across all skin tones. For a small percentage of users, various factors may make it difficult to get a blood oxygen measurement including motion, watch placement on the wrist, skin temperature and skin perfusion.”

But even if this all worked, there isn’t a clear enough reason for me to need this on my wrist all the time. Why shouldn’t I just pull out a pulse oximeter if I’m worried? While a low blood-oxygen level can be a gauge for the severity of Covid-19 and other conditions, there is no Apple Watch alert if yours drops below a certain threshold.

Apple says this is a wellness and fitness feature, not a health one, and it is beneficial to those who travel to places with higher altitudes or who are involved in performance training. Also, much like the heart-rate sensor, which is proving to be central to Covid-19 wearable studies, the blood-oxygen sensor can now be used to collect data to build detection algorithms and further medical research.

As for the always-on display, while I do appreciate being able to glance down and see the time without tapping on my wrist, I have had it disabled on my Series 5 for most of the year to eke out a bit more battery life. I’m even more interested in saving battery now that sleep tracking arrived with WatchOS 7.

No matter which model you pick, you have to recharge every day or so. If you sleep with your watch, you have to charge it when you wake up. Compare that to the $330 Fitbit Sense, which I charge every five days or so. It keeps tabs on your temperature, blood oxygen and heart rate. That said, it lacks a lot of the non-health functionality of the Apple Watch, and Fitbit’s software can be slow and buggy.

The ECG is really the only feature I would consider for the extra money. You have to follow your heart on that one (sorry, had to.) It’s a shame Apple pulled a vital health feature from the former Series 4 or 5 model it’s now calling SE.

The Future

Rewind the clock to 5½ years ago to when the Apple Watch first shipped, and the technical leaps are massive—waterproofing, bigger screens, better battery life, advanced sensors. Alongside those leaps, the product found its central purpose: fitness and health.

But it was mostly there with the Series 4. So why has development slowed to a snail’s pace since then? There could be two reasons: Apple engineers haven’t quite gotten the next major improvements right (multiday battery life in a thinner package), and Apple realized no one wants to buy a watch every two years like a smartphone. It makes you wonder why we need yearly updates on these at all?


The new Solo Loop bands don't have any clasps or buckles. You just slide your wrist into the stretch band.

Big leaps are still coming. I had a vision of it when I was hooked up to that monitor at my doctor’s office. The Series 6 already does two of the four readings: pulse and blood-oxygen levels. Temperature and blood pressure? Not yet. By combining more advanced health sensors and software that detects fluctuations, the Apple Watch and other wearables are going to become our ever-present health care minders.

In the here and now, though, the answer isn’t to buy a new one whenever a sensor gets added—especially when it doesn’t necessarily work. If you have an older model, grab a pulse oximeter from your drugstore and the super comfy $49 Solo Loop band from an Apple Store and call it a day. If it ain’t broke, don’t Series 6 it.",others
1074,"I’m actually kind of tired of the non-fitness people lamenting how useless the updates are. I trail run, hike, and road run, among other things, and the pulse oximeter and always-on altimeter is very nice to have, as well as the added battery life on outdoor runs.

Apple Watch Series 6 and SE Review: Watch Out for the Upsell
Apple’s latest watches do very few new things—but if you’re a first-time buyer or upgrading from a much older model, there’s a lot to consider
There is only one thing I’d urge you to wear this year: a mask. Oh, and pants. Please wear pants—even on video calls.
And what about the brand new $399 Apple Watch Series 6? Nope.
Hold up. Shouldn’t this be the year I encourage you to put cutting-edge health tech on your wrist? Wearables are now doing everything from scanning for early signs of infection to detecting heart problems to automatically calling emergency services if you fall.
Sure, the top-of-the-line Apple Watch Series 6 can do that stuff but so can models that cost far less.
If you have already got a two- or three-year-old Apple Watch, the gains with this new model aren’t substantial. Same screen, same battery life, same core functionality. And I found this year’s standout health feature—a blood-oxygen sensor—not ready for prime time, not to mention not useful.
Plus, if you’re a first timer, or in need of an upgrade, Apple now has two other lower-cost options: the Apple Watch SE and Series 3. Actually, make that three: The best deal going right now might be a refurbished Series 5.
It is OK to be confused. I’m here for you. After testing all the models last week—along with the $330 Fitbit Sense—I have arrived at a new theory of Watch-Nomics: You should upgrade your Apple Watch every three to five years. Any sooner, and spending more on a watch doesn’t mean proportionally more features. So make the call on your needed features, then make a purchase.
The Choices
Remember your SAT multiple-choice tactics? Eliminate two choices and you suddenly have a 50/50 shot at a correct pick. Buying an Apple Watch is like that:
A) Apple Watch Series 6 ($399): This one has the larger screen introduced in 2018, with an always-on display showing the time. It now has a slightly faster processor, slightly faster charging and the full health package, including an ECG electrical heart-rate sensor and new blood-oxygen sensor.
B) Refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 ($329): It’s basically a Series 6 without the blood-oxygen sensor. Apple stopped marketing it, but at time of publication, you could still find some variations in its refurbished store.
C) Apple Watch Series SE ($279): This resembles a Series 5 or 6, but without the always-on display, ECG or blood-oxygen sensor. It still has heart-rate tracking and notifications for high, low and irregular heart rate, as well as fall detection.
D) Apple Watch Series 3 ($199): OK, almost there. This one has an older design with a smaller screen, slightly shorter battery life and slower performance. It also has heart-rate tracking and heart-rate notifications, but no fall detection.
The Features
I anticipate most will choose A or C, especially if Apple runs out of refurbished Series 5s. So the real question is this: Are a blood-oxygen sensor, an ECG and an always-on display worth $120?

When I got the blood-oxygen sensor to work, most of my readings were in the healthy high-90% range.

However, often when I would manually initiate the 15-second test, I would get an “Unsuccessful Measurement,” indicating that the test didn’t work.

1093,"Apple Watch 6 44mm GPS+LTE Red edition

The watch as we know isn’t much of an upgrade from the 5.
The new features are basically the blood oxygen, the faster s6 chip, the new ultra wide U1 chip and the faster charging time of 1.5 hours and of course the 20% brighter always on display.

So here’s my take on the features it’s supposed to stand out from the watch 5.

1. I personally didn’t find the watch to be surprisingly faster than the watch 5 unless I was booting up or running tons of apps in the background.
2. The watch was the same brightness when on but was much much brighter when out in the sun and direct sunlight was hitting the displays. Indoors the always on display looks almost of the same brightness, except the colours on the 6 looks more crisper.
3. I compared the blood oxygen sensing to that of an hospital’s (I went for a test) as well as a local pulse oximetry device. The watch did accurate readings when hand was super stable and was worn higher up the wrist than usual. The blood oxygen levels measured during sleep were somewhat accurate too. The readings were almost same as the pulse oximetry device and almost came close to the hospital grade machine. 
4. Battery time took a hit since I had the LTE edition and I workout everyday for 6 hours so tracking that might have been a battery killer apart from the noise app which was also flagged to be dropping battery for others.
5. I can’t comment on the ultra wide U1 chip yet because I didn’t find much of a use for it. 

Overall I felt that the faster charging and brighter always on display were fantastic but at the same time I’m dejected that Apple didn’t make something ground breaking this year, I can understand that the people working at Apple had to manage COVID at the same time. 

If you’re planning on upgrading from a watch such as the 1,2,3 edition or maybe from nothing to an Apple Watch and want the fastest, brightest and health conscious watch and don’t care about the bucks you gotta spend this is the one for you. 
But if you are already having a 4 or 5 edition, spending the bucks on a watch with just 10% more features isn’t worth the value. Maybe wait for 7 or 8 to come with better features.",others

They built a tank in their studio, and shot a variety of species at 300 frames-per-second on incredibly high-end slow-motion Phantom cameras. Then they shrunk the resulting 4096 x 2304 images to fit the Watch’s screen, which is less than a tenth the size. Now, “when you look at the Motion face of the jellyfish, no reasonable person can see that level of detail,” Dye says. “And yet to us it’s really important to get those details right.”

They are producing cheap okay phones and that‘s good for people that don‘t have so much money or just want a basic phone imo.

Third party products only work for overpriced stuff otherwise they couldn‘t afford to produce them. They still make money with 3€ watch bands...

A product doesn’t need to have a logo to be considered a fake. If the shape is similar - not even exact but similar - is can be considered an attempt to copy an original. 

A fake product for private use is still an illegal, fake product. 

Aldo, it doesn’t matter what a product costs. If an original band costs $100 and costs $1 to make it doesn’t matter. Don’t buy it. 

If you buy a fake for $5 instead then you’re supporting an illegal market. 

But, bands are an irrelevant example anyways because Apple publicly provides the schematics to third parties to create bands for free.

If you want to buy fake products that’s up to you.

Companies as customs to look for bulk orders, which are also illegal.

US Customs defended itself by stating:

>	Upon examining the shipment in question, a CBP Import Specialist determined that the subject earbuds appeared to violate Apple’s configuration trademark. Apple has configuration trademarks on their brand of earbuds, and has recorded those trademarks with CBP. Based on that determination, CBP Officers at JFK Airport have seized the shipment under 19 USC 1526 (e). CBP’s seizure of the earbuds in question is unrelated to the images or language on the box. A company does not have to put an “Apple” wordmark or design on their products to violate these trademarks. The importer will have many opportunities through the adjudication process to provide evidence that their product does not violate the relevant recorded trademarks.

1533,"> Also new in watchOS 7 is a long-requested sleep tracking feature. Unfortunately it’s pretty useless. While the watch has some awareness of how long you were in bed and unconscious, there’s no data on the quality of your slumber -- nothing on how much deep, dreamy sleep you got versus a light doze.

Note that third party sleep tracking apps are great. I’ve been using autosleep for years and it massively improved my sleep, which has made a huge difference in my daily energy. 

These have always worked on apple watch, but if you never tried sleep tracking before: give a third party app a try.",energy

1546,"/u/swimbrief, adding you too. So, I think it depends on the issues you had. For me, I had bad sleep for years. Hard to fall asleep, easy to wake up in the morning. Sleep tracking let me try different things and measure whether they worked. 

There were some other benefits too. The tracking sums up your average sleep over a week. If I felt a bit tired but my average was good, prob didn’t need to plan on a nap. If I felt tired and average was bad, probably did. 

I could also see how different foods affected my sleeping heart rate and deep sleep. I figured out certain food triggers and eliminated them. (I often felt worse with these foods, but sometimes I also wake up tired without them. So having the numbers let me make better decisions). 

The waking hrv feature of autosleep is also useful. I’ve found it’s a decent indicator of how hard I can push myself in a workout on a given day. 

If you fall asleep whenever you want and sleep like a baby, there’s no need for tracking. But if you have any sleep issues it’s super helpful. 

Stuff that worked:

* Eating earlier in the day: both breakfast + final meal
* blackout blinds
* low dose melatonin
* More consistency in bedtime + making bedtime sooner",material

So if you aren’t using it to streamline your work emails and calendars or to improve your health metrics tracking goals you won’t get much from it besides a pretty way to see the time.,material
1574,I’ve never heard smart watches pitched as divorcing you from your phone. Maybe just saving some battery. It’s also like a watch so it’s like a fashion statement which is like the only point of the higher-end models like you bought. I use mine a lot for the Home app and flashlight and mainly it lets you see if a notification is dumb or actually worth taking your phone out. I hear a lot of people like them for the alarm because it just taps you on the wrist. Mainly I feel like you paid more and expected more tech but you actually just got more fashion.,material
1575,"These smart watches will not separate you from your phone. Maybe a Saturday afternoon you can leave the phone behind for a few hours, but don’t kid yourself thinking you’ll go days relying on your watch while you decrease your screen time. 

You hit the nail on the head, it integrates seamlessly with the Apple garden. And once you start to build the garden walls high enough, that’s when the watch, airtag, tv, HomeKit, etc becomes worth it. 

Homekit alone will be the main reason for years to come that I’ll continue to upgrade AWs every 2-3 years.",others
1576,"When i was at the office and when traveling a lot, I found having information and notifications on the wrist was a huge convenience.  However over the last year, working at home, I basically don't need it at all.  I wear it for the time mostly but I keep it in DND mode so all of the notifications alert on the phone.  So it really depends on who you are and how you use it.  One thing I to still appreciate is accepting 2FA for logging in to work.  I must use that at least 10 times a day and I like just tapping the watch to accept.

For the light user the SE or previous year's model is probably a better buy. 

LTE is a waste of money IMO as I have found very few practical use cases for it.  After two years of having it, I disconnected the LTE.

What is worth it is the stainless steel, but only if you plan to keep the watch or four years.  As it is the SS includes LTE anyway, but I would recommend just not paying for LTE (unless one wants to try it for a while to satisfy the curiosity.)  If they had a cheaper SS without LTE, i would recommend THAT one.  The sapphire crystal on my black SS S4 is still pristine (unscratched) unlike how my series 2 got pretty beat up over the two years I had it.  If you want the crystal to stay unscratched, it's worth paying for the SS model (especially the black with the coating.)  If you think you want to upgrade in a couple of years, I would save the money and stick with aluminum or an SE.

I personally don't think I'll upgrade until like series 7?  I just don't think I'll find it worth upgrading until blood glucose is added or my watch dies.  But I am still paying or AC+ so maybe I'll get it ""battery serviced"" and keep going?

I find the ceramic, titanium, and other premium models are probably just throwing money away but they do exist for people who want the splurge or a nice gift.  They are probably intended for people that make a lot more money than me and want premium expensive things.

Apple watch is always hard to justify because it's not a necessity by any means.  I used to run a lot and I thought it was great for tracking my runs.  I'll probably get back into that as it is.",others
1577,"I'm down 80lbs since I got my watch. Makes logging and tracking fitness and consumption MINDLESS and yes, WORTH EVERY health savings dollar!!!

SOOOO much health data. I have been able to increase my oxygen consumption and improve my walking stride, gate, and pace. Its fun to know more about yourself. 

I got the watch for fitness and health, but end up using it everyday to automate my house lights, fans, and blinds, the watch vibrate on my wrist in the car when I am using CarPlay for directions, I can control my music when walking using the watch and my AirPods.

&#x200B;

Yes! Worth it! But then again, I got my watch Series 5, brand new, through an Amazon deal and paid using my Health Savings Account. The watch was $200. So yes, definitely worth it. I would never ever ever ever pay $1,300 for a watch that's going to get dinged up. 

But its all subjective and personal. 

But without the watch, I might not have lost 80lbs as consistently as I have, so for me, I probably would have paid $1,300 for that because I have saved SOOOOOO much time and money on health care in the long run.",material
1578,"Received my Apple Watch series 6 as a gift. Have had it for a year now and I can’t say I’d have bought it for myself. It’s basically a Fitbit on steroids aka activity tracker plus a ton of additional health related products that have no value to me for a much bigger price tag.
For example things like blood oxygen and heart rate tracking aren’t particularly valuable to me… I have no idea what my blood oxygen should be or why it’s important and the app doesn’t seem to provide much education. The heart rate monitor is unreliable… it fails to get a clear reading as often as it succeeds so I’d never feel comfortable relying on it. You can use it to take a picture from your phone… I do use that on occasion.
Notifications aren’t all that helpful since voice dictation inevitably has typos, but you can’t edit them from the watch. Nor can you read the message you dictated before sending so I always end up pulling out my phone to text or to correct whatever I dictated through the watch. Call quality on the watch is patchy.
I like it for running and sometimes I can sync my audible books to the watch and I love not having to take my phone, but out of 3 books I tried to sync only one ever actually downloaded to the watch. Plus it doesn’t seem to sync with the phone if you do succeed in downloading an audiobook, listen to it on your watch, and then return to the phone you’ll be in a different place than where you left off. 
Couldn’t say what else it’s good for since reading anything on it just makes you pull out your phone, you can’t type on it and the dictation is average at best. I haven’t tried putting it on my phone plan so can’t comment if that would improve my experience. Overall it seems like a gimmick product Apple is using to source data for their healthcare projects.

Apple Watch is designed at its core to improve your understanding of your health. It’s the main reason people purchase this device. Beyond the health tracking features, the productivity features are almost a basic given. Complications are a cool way to track many things at once so play around with watch faces to find what gets the most of our if it for you. At the end of the day, it’s a watch.

If your primary goal is to count your steps and get your heart rate, you may be better off getting an earlier model like SE? Since it does the job and it's gonna be cheaper too.

I decided to get Series 7 because I liked the screen size and I figured I'm not gonna upgrade for a while so I should just get the newest model. I also thought the blood oxygen feature was cool lol",others
1600,You seriously need to go to the Apple web site and look at all the info Apple give on using and owning an AW. Also there are lots of reviews on AW on YouTube and other tech review sites. Practically everyone here on this sub would recommend a S7 as it’s the latest model (this is a sub for AW after all) with the most features but also would recommend the SE too if money is an issue. All AWs and Apple Health app do not prioritise step counting as a primary judge of fitness.,material

No regrets upgrading",material

However, it is a personal matter. On TikTok there are many reels of people claiming to have wasted money leaving the AW unloaded in a drawer. This is not my case. The watch made me want to run and train and I have never stopped since. The function of the rings works on my person, despite being a person who has always been fit, I used to have that extra kilos that I can now keep under control and do good for my health.

1632,"Honestly aesthetics in the end. First few weeks you'll try have fun messing around with all the feature then you'll just end up not using it for all it has. Only to see notifications if you're walking, your phone is not near you and to check time. Especially if you're in highschool and you're only part time it's really not that useful. And it's yet another thing to charge. You forget to charge it? Can't use it. And then if you really don't go out a lot then it's just gonna sit around eventually. My two cents is you could do a lot more with $190 than get a smart watch. If you want it to track fitness you can get a fitness band for way cheaper it also tells you the time, some even notifications. Then you can use the rest of the money on something else you really want. You want to just tell the time? Get a watch. You'll realise as well that you're just gonna reach for your phone anyway when you get a notification and such. A smart watch is a luxury not a necessity. If you're worried you could spend the money on other stuff especially if you don't have much already, don't buy it and spend it on something more useful to you.",material

1636,"You might not be into fitness *now*but after getting mine, I started to care about the little things more. My heart rate, how many steps I’m getting, etc. and started comparing that to my friends (even if they just use their phone which also counts steps albeit not as accurately. 

I love my watch, it’s beautiful, I can customize it, I can check my steps and heart rate, I can do some fitness (it even automatically detects work outs like riding a bike and can save them after the fact even if I didn’t tell it I was riding a bike let’s say). 

I also use Siri a lot for reminding me to do stuff, and the silent alarm is insanely useful. Those are some of the things it can also do. If NONE of that seems of any use, just get a regular watch. 

It doesn’t have to change your life completely to be worth it. Those are all things I can do on my phone, but I also don’t need to have my phone with me to do like almost any of that. At work (I work in manufacturing), I can’t always be checking my phone but I can get away with talking to my wrist to reply to a text or anything else of the sort. 

You can also obviously reply to texts and compose messages on it which is awesome and I could see that being useful in high school now lol. 

And also, it can text loud noises and monitor noise levels in db, which is very useful to me. And it can remind you to stop and do breathing exercises which can help with anxiety and mindfulness. I say go for it man. It’s extremely good for just getting you to do bare minimum things to improve your life.",material

1639,I held off one because for the longest time I didn’t care about the fitness stuff. Quiet honestly still don’t. I got mine for two reasons. First - I’m a sucker for cool tech stuff.

1640,"I own a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2. It is definitely still fun to use. It is really great to have notifications on my wrist. My phone isn't always in my pocket, sometimes it is in the bag or in some family member's bag, so then it  is really useful. Also for taking up phone calls. The fitness features are really good. I also track my sleep with the watch, and the app gives me a score on how good my sleep was. 

The heart rate feature is nice to have, but I am young so I don't really look at that much. I don't really use many apps on it, but I would like to have a WhatsApp app or Telegram on it. But WhatsApp app doesn't exist, and Telegram is only on WearOS or WatchOS. The app ecosystem isn't great in Tizen... But you have an Apple Watch, so that's no problem for you. Also, the new health features on the newer watches are really nice, like the SpO2 (blood oxygen) and the new body composition on the Samsung Galaxy Watch4. I have a Xiaomi Smart Scale for the Body Composition, imagine how cool it is to just do that from your wrist! 

So I have told you some negatives and positives, but before I sum it all up, I have to tell you what I paid for it. I paid €280 (euros), which might be close to 300 dollars, and I bought the Stainless Steel one. The Aluminum ones were much cheaper, around 180 dollars. I'd say that's worth it, if you can find it at that price. But the Apple Watch SE without AOD and ECG sensor is priced around 280 dollars, which is a little overpriced in my opinion.

At the end, if you will really use the health and fitness features and notifications that are built-in, I would say it's worth it, because those are the features most people use. And if you don't use those, then you probably almost won't use it, which makes it not worth it.",others

I primarily use it for the gym and spotify, weather of course, the time, and i found watch calendar app called Fantastical that works real well with my gcal and use siri to add new appointments to it.

Myself, I love mine. It’s definitely nice to quickly answer calls and texts, control Apple music, quickly check the weather, change my house thermostat, can’t forget the time, and it undoubtedly helps with health if you follow through.

I use it to receive texts from co-workers and timers while lecturing so I don't go over time and can receive info if I need to cut it short or drag it out.

Nah I guess it wasn’t worth it for me lol.",material

I have also occasionally had fainting spells. The watch will call emergency services If I fall and can’t respond. It’s a little bit of insurance. 

I also like that it allows me to be untethered to my phone I don’t like carrying it around all the time, especially on walks. I like to be unburdened.  

I have found it more useful than I expected. Can I live without it, yes. But I do like it, and I’m the kind of person who holds on to devices forever.  So… I’d say worth is a matter of how you would use it.",material
1654,"I’ve had mine for 2.5 years now.  What I like about it:
1. It’s a watch - time, timers, alarms, date, I forgot what it was like to wear a useful watch.  
2. Fitness - The rings really do motivate me to be more active than I was before.  Now I have to close all the rings and meet the challenges which Has been great during this coronavirus era of staying at home.  
3. Ping my iPhone - It seems silly but instead of asking for someone to call my phone when it’s somewhere in the house just pinging it has been great.  (It falls between the crack of your car seat, under the couch, etc.)  
4.  Outlook meeting details.  I setup a watch face for work, and the middle is an Oulook complication that tells me when and where the next meeting is.  
5.  World Time - I work with people on the other side of the globe, so another work complication is world time for their time zone.  

Lesser things:  
1. When using AirPods and playing something on your phone, you can use the Digital Crown to adjust the volume.  
2. Easy use of HomeKit - When I’m exercising I can use it to lock/unlock the door.  
3.  Remote iPhone Camera control - for group photos it’s nice to see the framing and to trigger the shutter remotely.

Overall, I’m glad I got the series 3 when I did.  It wasn’t too much and I’ve gotten a lot out of it.  I’m considering upgrading to a S7 Cellular to get the extra health items and to be able to stream Apple Music directly without a phone when I workout.",material
1655,"I was feeling the same way when I was about to get mine, and I decided to go for it in the end. IMO, totally worth it. I thought it would only be useful for when I exercise, but it actually motivates you to improve your lifestyle. It reminds you to breathe, to stand for a while when you have been sitting for too long and it is helpful to control your overall health. Being able to answer calls, see your notifications and reply to texts directly from your wrist when you don't have your phone next to you really comes in handy as well. And tbh $190 is a bargain, so I would definitely get it.",material
1656,"I bought my watch in May 2020 and have worn it everyday since so that I could use it for fitness tracking, weight loss, and constant connectivity to my phone. I am down 98lbs and have increased muscle mass because my watch has motivated me to keep up activity streaks. Also, its been super convenint responding to texts using the watch while my phone is in my pocket. I can use the Walkie Talkie feature to talk to Walkie Talkie other watch users from anywhere and its a legit walkie talkie. I like that I can utilize my Reminders and Calendar from my watch without having to take my phone out of my pocket. I can make calls from the watch if I have my hands full and Siri is super helpful with home automations with my lights and blinds, right from my wrist.

The watch has been a life changer for sure for me. So yes, VERY well worth it, especially since I take care of it and have a case and screen protector so that I can have it for a longer period of time, which really stretches out the cost of the watch.

So for High School, if you were super organized like I was, you'd have ALL of your classes and extracurricular activities in your calendar as well as all your social appointments with friends, camping trips, field trips, birthday parties, etc. Test reminders, reminders to study, reminders to read, reminders to go to bed, etc.",material

I read a financial comparison between buying stock in Apple vs spending the same money on equipment over the years … the stock payoff is waaay better, but the equipment is more fun. At this price, I think you’d enjoy it and it may help establish some healthy habits and productivity that will serve you well in the future. You don’t need it, but it’s definitely worth it at $190. It also does neat little things like unlock your Mac, use Apple Pay with a wave of the hand, find your iPhone, saves wear and tear on your phone battery, etc",others

I did find it to be good as a sports activity tracker, but then again fairly high priced for that segment of devices.

In the end it felt like wasted money sitting around too much, so I sold it to recoup. I might one day pick up a used GPS-only one for when I’m biking etc, if I find a cheap one. Would not pay full price at current price Structures as the value was just not there for me.",material

Some things I like:

it tells you exactly where and when-to turn when using GPS by buzzing your wrist

Temperature/weather/time/date a lift away

Unlocks your phone automatically when you have a mask on, life saver

“Hey Siri, call my dad” “hey Siri, show me pictures of watermelons” “hey Siri, set a timer for 22 minutes”

I kinda like the idea of a strap collection, I could use a collection anyways since I’ve never had one

Notification read and responses in seconds

1676,"It’s not an essential. And I intend to keep my series 5 for several years rather than on a more frequent upgrade cycle like a phone. 

That said, I use it constantly. It has its own separate uses like activity tracking which is great and valuable but my most constant use is in doing things I’d otherwise do on my phone… without my phone. Siri requests, smart home control, timers, making and answering phone calls, responding to messages (and not just iMessage, works with other messaging apps, too), quick calendar checks, step tracking, sleep tracking… and it tells the time. 

It charges in like an hour or less so you can wear it pretty much 24/7, and I do unless going somewhere where it would look out of place.",material
1677,"I think the Apple Watch is a device that really is in a new niche the way the iPad was when it first came out. It’s really hard to know in advance if it’s for you or not. 

A month ago, I was a firm “no” on the Watch. It was cool, but what did I really need it for? 

Three weeks ago, it happened that managed to sell a few items for more cash than I expected and Best Buy was having a major sale on Apple Watches. On a whim, I read up a little again on what the Watch can do and I started to reconsider. I took a few days to think but ultimately decided to pull the trigger and see if the reality of the Watch lived up the usefulness I imagined it could have. 

Two weeks later to today, I feel like I really made the right choice. 

The health features are mostly a novelty to me, but they may see more use as time goes on. 

The big winner for me is all my notifications being mirrored from my phone so I never miss anything. This might not be critical for everyone, but with two young kids this is a lifesaver. Saving a few seconds countless times a day and not needing to fumble my phone out so often really adds up. 

Having selectable little bits of data on the watch face is also saving a lot of time throughout the day. 

Siri/voice dictation on your wrist is more useful than you might imagine. I can have short text exchanges while walking on the street without slowing down to get my phone out and queue commands to the phone without touching the phone. 

Haptic feedback on your wrist makes reminders, alarms and Maps driving directions much less intrusive while at the same time being much more reliable. I don’t miss turns when my watch taps my wrist but I can keep the audio on my phone off so it doesn’t bother everybody else in the car.",material
1678,"It has improved my life a lot. Mainly because of its capability to track the calories you burn and your daily activity. The way I see it is that you can't improve what you can't measure. So, the Apple Watch allows me to improve in this aspect. All the other things are handy, having the calendar readily available, keeping track of the last time I fed my cat, no-screen way of getting GPS directions (and hence, a safer driving experience), and its ability to track my sleep quality are all great extras.",material

I don’t really care about the rings, except for calorie burn which is about +\- 10% accurate. 

The watch is highly capable (heart rate monitor, gps, compass, elevation detection, calorie calculator). But you will get the most out of the watch if you use an app dedicated to the activity you want to track. For me that’s Nike run club and Dawn Patrol.

Apple still promotes it because it is the cheapest entry level watch that they offer. Why wouldn't they promote it? People who want a better model can pay more and get that and people who are looking for the lowest price model can buy the 3.

Sport loop for sure. The velcro closure makes it much more adjustable. The solo loop and braided loop are basically sized the same way as the sport band, so you'd have to choose the smaller size.

Yes I think it isn’t there yet. Perhaps one running a meant-to-be-stand-alone OS (like a skinned Android) with a Bluetooth mini QWERTY keyboard would the issues I’ve highlighted.

One other consideration that popped up for me a few times is that it’s your phone on your wrist. If you are going to a formal event, it really stands out and makes you look like a SpyKid. I think most smartwatches will, the displays look too 2D to fool anyone that it’s not a ‘real’ watch (even with Always-On).

Apps are mostly useless, just like terrible realisation of telegram app. So you see my point I hope.",material

Yet, price gap between SE and 6-7 is much lesser, but you are having whole Apple Watch experience with a lot of health features and so on. That’s a personal opinion of course, but my thoughts about this is when you spend a couple of hundred bucks, pay a bit more and have a lot more. If not, just go with cheaper similar thing which even lives longer.",material

That said, the things the Watch does well, it does *very, very* well, especially considering how much technology and battery life is packed into such a minuscule device.

I personally believe the Series 7 is a fantastic Apple Watch but the price tag is out of my reach.  I was also looking at the SE, which I ended up getting to replace my Series 3, and what sold me on that was expandability.

Sure, you can buy a new 42mm Series 3 for $200 or less.  With the way Apple's software updates have been going, they are making it difficult to update the Series 3 to a new watchOS because of the limited amount of space on the watch.  The Series 6, Series 7, and SE all have 32GB of space while the Series 3 only has 8GB.

The style I like most of all is the Submariner, and that’s 50% being a James Bond nut and 50% a fetish for ‘tool’/utilitarian products that have crossed over into luxury. From a design standpoint, I love my watches… but I honestly NEVER wear them. Some are in a safety deposit box and the rest are in a watch box in my dresser. I haven’t worn one in at least 10 months.

The Apple Watch is literally the perfect watch, and my wallet appreciates the price difference. My splurge with the Apple Watch is that I own two, an aluminum S5 and an aluminum S6. When I wore mechanical I never took my watches off, except to swap them out, and having two AW lets me always have one on my wrist. I’ll be upgrading the S5 this year only because I want to get a SS in gold.

Apple devices do seem to retain their value quite well and I could probably sell the S7 for £250 and buy the S8. After all, the S4 are still selling between £200 and £250.

I carry my phone where ever I go. There are sensors that interest me, and I would be interested in wearing it when I sleep (I used to have a jawbone, but the strap broke twice, and the company gave up and left the market). 

I would have liked a longer battery life, which a processor produced on a smaller node would have helped achieve.

I have checked the size of the S6 watch in the apple store, and I know I need at least a 7” watch strap, so either the 41mm or 45mm S7 would be OK for me, just a matter of whether I would prefer the larger screen. 

It sometimes takes me a while to make a decision, especially when there is significant costs involved. For a watch, its pretty expensive, though my Citizen eco watch costs about £250, so I am not adverse to spending that type of money on a watch. 

The only reason I am hesitant, is if the processor is the same as the S6, and knowing that Apple is moving towards a smaller node for it processors, which could potentially produce a more efficient processor, I am wondering whether waiting for the S8 would be better if it hopefully has longer batter life.

2374,"Great review. I recognize that these are your opinions, but my comments anyway:

> Battery life has been fantastic when raise to wake is disabled...

> While it works 95% of the time I want it to work, it also lights up the screen when I don't want to, especially while running. 

Always on display is a requirement for me. I want to see something there always. I just need the watch to get me through the day, and, for me, charging while I eat breakfast and shower (times I am not active anyway) and an hour before bed (again, times that I am winding down) is more than good enough. I always go to bed with 100% charge, and have plenty left at the end of even a 2 hour workout.

I couldn't stand it when I had the S2 and went for a run and couldn't see the data on the screen - raise to wake worked only sometimes, and I'd have to exaggerate the motion or tap the display to see stats. AOD is so much better IMO. I won't get another watch without it (unless Apple stops making them with AOD - unlikely).

> Apple Health syncs everything between all the health related apps, but it does not seem to detect duplicates. While you can disable write permissions for one of both apps, it would be nice if duplicates were detected and removed.

For my indoor cycling workouts (just as an example), I have a cycling computer that syncs with an app on my iPhone (and Apple Health) at the same time the cycling workout from the watch syncs. However, I do not get duplication in total exercise time or any of the rings. (I keep both because the workouts app doesn't capture cadence or distance for indoor workouts while the Wahoo app can report that.)

> Limited storage capacity. With only four 3rd party apps installed, my watch won't install WatchOS updates complaining there's too little storage space. Having to unpair your watch, update and restore from a backup gets old very quickly.

That's really only an issue for older S3 older watches, FWIW. I understand that it sucks if you have an older S3 with a small amount of storage, but the newer watches have plenty more storage and no issues with updating.

> The activity goals are the same for every day, and they're always absolute and not relative. 

I'd also love to see smarter goals, and a recognition of easy days and rest days, and even injuries and injury recovery, with recover plans, etc. However, I think the ring motivation is meant for people who are new to Apple Watch and have not exercised regularly in the past, to try to get them to make daily exercise and movement a habit. I respect that and frankly I don't really care if I don't meet the move goal - I have a workout schedule and don't really need the watch to motivate me to get it done. (Frankly, what I probably need the watch to do is to recognize when maybe I've been doing too much and maybe it's time to rest or take it easier.)",others
2375,"As for the raise to wake, the only reason I keep that on is that when I get a notification, I don’t want to have to touch the screen to see the notification.  

Basically if I could see notifications with raise to wake but otherwise have that feature disabled so it’d not randomly turning on the screen, that would be perfect!",material

My S5 have started losing my heart rate for 1-5 minutes during my runs. It's almost never for a majority of a run, so at the moment I'm not too annoyed, just a little perplexed. Well, my previous Forerunner instead often just showed my heart rate at ""sitting"" rate when I was trying to run at a decent speed (I am not an experienced runner), so I guess a wrong heart is more annoying than no measurement. 

""Sleep"" have given me some weird sleep and wake up times when I tried it, so for that I use the Forerunner instead. 

So yeah, I agree with your assessment of the AW,",material

2380,"> I'd also love to see smarter goals, and a recognition of easy days and rest days, and even injuries and injury recovery, with recover plans, etc

Yes, same. I'd happily pay a premium for that, too. 

Something between the apple watch and the woop band. You know, the hardware of the apple watch but with things like the recovery score for woop (if you are familiar). Just something that aggregates some kind of score based the exercise you've done over the last week and your rest/sleep.

And of course 'rest days' would be good for the AW. I'm currently training for Audax cycling, so I might do 250km in one go then nothing for 2 days. Doesn't really seem fair that I'll have done 7,000kcal+ on a Saturday and then not reach my move goal on a Sunday or Monday and then be made to feel guilty (or worse, feel like I'm overtraining by doing anything on those rest days). 

On the sleep schedule you can customise every day, the move/exercise/stand being along the same lines would be a big change.",material
2381,"Interesting remarks, thanks.

Does the always on display also work with 3rd party (fitness) apps, or is it limited to the Apple Workout app?

Hmmm, might me be that I have some settings set up badly that is causing the duplicates.

Good to know that when I upgrade the limited storage capacity will no longer be an issue.

I agree, smarter goals recognizing easy and rest days would be another interesting implementation. I do concur, the ring motivation might be targeted towards a different topic. Nevertheless, it feels a bit annoying that I can't always close all the rings while I do feel I live an active lifestyle.",material

2384,"Yes, I have used both a Wahoo Tickr and Polar H9 chest strap with the Apple watch. As soon it's connected via bluetooth, the heart rate readings are coming from the chest strap instead of the watch. You can confirm this by using the heart rate app. If you get an instant reading, it's coming from the strap and not the watch. Another way is to log a workout, go to the Health app, and under Heart Rate you'll find ""Show All Data"". Most workout apps will mention your chest strap as the source. Some apps just mention the app as a source, regardless of whether or not you're using a chest strap.",material

We are all wearing these devices to get these data points but can the data gathered actually stand up to lab tests?

Apple makes a better smartwatch, no question. If you want download apps, Siri and proper notifications, etc., its hard to beat.

If you want a real sports watch, Garmin is the better option. The Apple watch is really a toy in comparison. Better than a fitbit, but same target user who values the ""smart"" features more than the sports features. 

GPS is a major Garmin weakness IMO. I had to get a Stryd pod to fix it. That is totally unacceptable.

Garmin body battery is underrated. I look at it regularly, and I don't think Apple has anything like that. It has to be worth a few points.

Plus you missed one of the main advantages of Fenix watches over your average smartwatch, their durability. It'll survive much more abuse and look newer after getting roughed up on hiking trails and in the gym.

2424,"I don't have a defective unit. It is a known bug and it was reported to Garmin multiple times by a lot of users. The problem is caused by a metal bezel (FR has plastic one and no issues) combined with Garmin algorithm to exclude data points with weak GPS signal if they are too close to previous registered point. It prevents counting weak signal-caused floating counted as a movement. Problem is arising when you are a slow runner **and** running in the forest or near high buildings. Your slow pace makes even a correct readout as a floating and discarding it. Result: wrong distance & pace. Garmin should adapt this algorithm to account units with weaker signal by design. It never happened.

As you see, I got pretty familiar with Fenix and did some research.

You can't disable notifications for specific apps on iOS. You can on Android. This post is dedicated for iOS users as it compares Apple Watch with Fenix and I marked in this point of my review I am writing about iOS.

I moved from a Samsung Galaxy Watch to the Fenix 6x pro.  I made the switch as I wanted more for fitness related stuff.  And I wanted maps on the go.  And better battery life (although, Samsung is better than AW in that department as I used to get 4-days on the Samsung).  I couldn't really care less about the lack of smart watch functionality on the Fenix as it does enough for me (I get notifications and I can quick reply but need to use my phone for more functionality which is fine).

With regards to the GPS.  I have also read that the GPS tracking isn't that great.  Maybe because I'm not an elite athlete, but for me, what is more important, is consistency.  If my Fenix is under/over calculating distance then I'm ok with that providing as it's consistenly under/over calcualting it.  That way, I can see improvements.  If my 10km run is really 10.5km then the distance doesn't matter (for me) as long as it always says 10km and I can see improvements to my time.

Watching the Olympics motivated me to get off my fat arse and start running again.  Started back in early August and I'm now seeing the improvements.  I get up at 5AM, which I used to do anyway before I started running again, and I'm running 10KM 3 days a week and 10km walks a day the rest of the week.  It's starting to get cold in the mornings (not Canada cold though) and dark.  Whilst it's not too cold I would suggest getting out now before the weather really changes and then becomes an excuse not to do anything.

For context, back in my Army days, I would easily push out 6 min miles over half marathon distances.  When I started running again I could barely jog and was doing 13-min miles.  I've completed my 10km run this morning and I got a 10-km record which averaged at 10:13 min miles.

For me the biggest issue is the API on the weather which is nearest weather station (fortunately mine is only 8miles away), rather than doing it via direct location and using a source like Weather Channel etc. But if your nearest one was 100miles or so away (which some people have) it wouldn't be of much asssistance.",material

GPS is ok when the signal is good or you are moving fast enough. More, the GPS signal is good enough itself, the problem lies in Garmin's algorithm to exclude data points with weaker data points. After parsing raw data from the watch in external software you get correct results.  
I pointed it out as it directly affects my use: I am a slow runner (6 min/km is a race pace for me) and I am running in the forest.",material
2437,"My experience is with the Fenix 6 and it is not unusually based on what I have read online and on Reddit.

I do think it depends on where you (which satellites networks are available) and what kind of access the watch has to the sky (buildings, trees etc).

It also depends what you are using GPS for. Most of the YouTube videos I’ve see focus on comparing the GPS tracks between the watches and the distance recorded at the end of the activity. My experience with Garmin has been OK from that perspective although there was a software upgrade about 6 months ago that screwed it up. I use the Fenix 6 for hiking/trail running navigation and it is great.

My real issue with GPS on Garmin is that it is virtually useless for real-time pace calculation. Probably more to do with how they are processing GPS data rather than the GPS chip itself. Whatever the reason, it’s pretty hopeless.

Same error is obviously good enough if you train for yourself (like I do), but getting consistent readout is also a hard thing: GPS signal strength varies if there are dense clouds, so on that days you might get different distance (and pace as a consequence).

So you’re either always aware of what day you last charged your watch or constantly checking how much battery your watch has?

Perhaps.

Do you really not see how less battery life is not ideal? It's not a complicated concept. You keep going on and on about routine but fail to realize that if it lasted 5 days, you could still have a routine... just not daily. 

To answer your question: yes I am always 100% aware of my battery charge status. And on my previous fitbit that lasted 3-4 days, when I saw it was at or around 15% battery I knew I could still go like 12-24 hours with it before I needed to recharge.

I put it on in the morning before going to the gym and the only time I take it off before I go to bed at night is when I take a shower. I like the Siri functionality especially with my AirPods Pro in. It also works really well when I take a walk at night time and leave my phone on the couch. I can listen to music and still answer calls, texts and emails from the watch.

>Apple Watch also notifies you via different sounds and through vibration using the Taptic Engine. Each type of notification has a different feel. Once you learn these taptic patterns, it helps you know the type of notification before you even look at it. A good example of this was the Maps experience. When walking down the street to a meeting in San Francisco, I used the Watch to guide me there. The Apple Watch has a different taptic pattern for going left and for going right. This way, I didn’t need to lift my wrist to look at the display to know which way to go. The implications of these different types of notifications based on feel are unexplored territory.

The watch works and doesn’t have a scratch on it, but it’s bulky on my wrist and somewhat slow to respond to taps. I’m hopeful that I can get a slightly smaller form factor without compromising the size of the display, and I am really looking forward to not having to tap to see the time!",others
2850,I had an s3 and between the larger display and snappier everything it’s a completely different and better experience. The s3 would take 8 seconds just to open calculator and the s7 it’s open before I can even lift my finger from the screen.,material

It feels so much more usable now, especially with how fast it is. My Series 0 is sluggish at most things to say the least. I was also surprised by how much lighter the Series 7 is, but then again, I went from stainless steel to aluminium. It’s so light now that I do forget it’s on my wrist most of the time.

Still getting used to all of the new features I’ve been missing out on for years!",material
2852,"I came from an S3 and agree with all this. The S7 is amazing and makes me love my watch again. Like you I was using my S3 for time/temperature and notifications. The new screen and speed are awesome. I haven’t seen many people talk about the shape but I also really love the new rounder “smooth pebble” shape vs the original design. It’s subtle but I like the way it looks a lot more.

Also agree about the contour face, I wish it stayed bulgy with the display asleep. I submitted feedback to Apple and encourage you to do the same.",material

This was a massive upgrade for me coming from the S2 


Also

I think I’m underplaying how helpful the new fast charge feature is!

I only remove and charge my watch once a day (morning as I wear it to sleep as well) and it’s back upto full in no time. Infact I stopped looking at battery as it literally ends ATLEAST with 30% the next morning . I’m a medium user btw with AOD on",material
2863,Thanks!,material
2864,"Not really. As I said the edge to edge display isn’t that noticeable with watch faces and apps it’s only with certain screens you’ll notice it but it’s not like it’s on every screen. In fact the only reason I knew the screen flowed off the edge is when the contour face runs along the edge but the face shrinks back inside when on AOD mode…

The only thing you would really notice is that buttons are easier to tap that’s it.  Sure blood oxygen is a nice addition but it’s not fda approved and not as accurate as a finger read blood oxygen monitor. So the upgrades are really negligible.",others

2871,"I use it, and I think it’s pretty cool.  If you have any reservations about security then it’s best to stay away, but it’s been very handy during last minute Costco runs when my hands are full",material
2872,I only use it when I forget my phone in the house and need to get into my car,material
2873,Why would you need to take your phone out to open the trunk?,material
2874,I use “Tesla remote” app works for watch.,material
2875,What about battery life? I’ve read it consumes faster because the car needs to be active (like sentient mode),material
2876,"I use it and LOVE IT. I set it up so I lift my wrist and say “let’s roll” and it unlocks my car, sets the temp and turns the car on.
Lots of features. One of the few apps I actually spent $ on….
For battery usage, you can set it tin”ping” the car (I have it set to hourly from 6am till 11pm) so it stays current with the stats",material
2877,I use it also (actually have two watch apps). It also makes creating shortcuts 10x easier (I.e. I can setup a shortcut to preheat my car when my alarm for work goes off).,material
2878,I use it.. it's actually not bad.. sometimes it logs out which is annoying but 99% of the time it does the job,material
2879,I use it all the time. I open the trunk with it and I have a widget in the corner that shows me the battery percentage got while I’m charging,material
2880,Does this app exist on samsung watch?,material
2881, Use one called “Watchla”,material
2882,"I don't know how it works for the iPhone but I'm on the Garmin one (which is a free app on Garmin store with source on GitHub), nothing leaves your phone. It creates a token that is used to talk to Tesla's infrastructure. I know because I'm working with the source for that app.",material
2883,Exactly. Wasn’t the last report of Teslas being “hacked” revolving around a third-party app?,material
2884,Been thinking about developing a self-hosted version of one of these apps. Would you consider using that? I feel like some of them are lacking in UX & Features but understand the security concerns.,material
2885,"So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way",material
2886,That’s how that massive hacker was able get control of every single Tesla that had their account details out into his app for cool features.,material
2887,"Nope, you can remote start with the app. Don’t need the phone or a key!",material
2888,Not sure how that makes sense. You can just close the app when you’re not using it.,others
2889,"But if the app is compromised so is the communication, isn’t it? And Tesla doesn’t make it easy to manage tokens/api keys so it can be a hassle",material
2890,"Right, and once you have a token you can tell the car to do anything you want, and harvest any data you want",material
2891,"Specifically, it was the self-hosted websites that were hacked.  Not the app itself.

People need to change default credentials when they host sites.",material
2892,I wouldn’t use anything self hosted to be honest… it would have to use Teslas API’s,material
2893,"Wouldn’t it need to go through the Tesla servers anyways and therefore would require either API keys or credentials? 

It’s been a while since I’ve looked into this but has tesla developed a better way to manage said API keys and make it easier to track usage and allow to easily revoke them?",material
2894,"It uses the same undocumented/unsupported API that every other sources like teslafi, Optiwatt uses. If Tesla ever decides to harden their communication technology, they will all stop working at once. I sure hope it doesn't come to that because I do love my Teslamate and Garmin watch app.",material
2895,">So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way

Its not the app on the watch controling your car.. that is not possible because everything needs to go through tesla servers and be verified with tokens etc. Basically what the app does is imitate the original tesla app by issuing the same commands and using its token. If it is open source and it can be seen that the tokens are stored on your device not on some db hosted with the developer then it is safe as it works exactly like the original. But as you said those token gives access to your car and anyone sharing them needs to be cautious about it.",material
2896,"I did use the “remote start” under settings before to remote start the car before heading to the garage, but then my phone was with me … will try without the phone altogether.",material
2897,"Compromised how? By a malicious attack? By code written to harvest your credentials? That's what I like about open source code, you can check it yourself and if that is not enough, compile your own version (which is what I do, but not out of fear, but so I have access right away to the features I add).

On my Garmin, when it needs to connect, it asks for my username password on my phone (through the Garmin app) and that is used to generate the token.",material
2898,"Yeah, but that token cannot simply be stolen like that. It's not like it's laying around. It's within the apps realm only.",material
2899,"There’s two ways you would do this where you wouldn’t share your credentials with a third party. 

First is to make the requests directly to Teslas servers from an application, second would be to set up a self-hosted server that facilitates interaction with Tesla’s servers and no third party. 

Either way you’re typing your credentials into an “unofficial” app, they’re just never going anywhere but to either yourself, or Tesla.

I haven’t looked into how Tesla handles authentication, but I doubt they have an Oauth system.",material
2900,"I'm not suggesting it can be ""stolen"" because it doesn't need to be, it's already been given freely to the app.

The Tesla app on my Garmin watch has its source on GitHub so you can see what it does and if you're very paranoid, you can compile your own copy (like I do but not for that reason but to have the features I added right away and not wait for the updated app to appear on the store).

On the one hand this isn't such a bad thing since it does the sharpening really well, but on the other hand I don't think it always looks true to life as a result. 

The real problem I see with the Xs and moreso the X is the method of noise reduction Apple applies in their processing. It tends to muddy up details. From what I've seen this is significantly better on the Xs, but still could use some work.

But here's the real question. If we're focusing on the issue of fine detail can we objectively say which one is better? As a Google branded phone user I've always been in the camp of the more detail the better under all circumstances. However, with the introduction of the Xs I'm really not so sure anymore.

Documented by whom? If these animals were really skinned alive and this will be proven in court, then the people who did this will go to prison and business owner will lose his income (deservedly so).
There is no good angle how you can document skinning animals alive, but you can just lie about the fact that animal was alive and cause investigation.

Objects don’t have feelings and don’t have rights.
Animal rights and regulations regarding their welfare exist exactly because people don’t want to treat animals like objects. These are constantly improving as well, the more we learn about animal behavior and physiology.

For the same reason “free range” farms exist as well, where animals are not locked up in tight cages.

I myself new right from the start that I would never use the Blood Oxygen or the ECG feature, and I realized the Always On Display didn’t matter to me at all because I mostly wear long sleeves and if I really wanted to glance at the time, I could just turn the digital crown a bit.

I’d say go for the SE to try it out, and if it really suits you, just hang on to the SE for some time (it’s such a good watch still a year after release) and upgrade to a new watch when there are actually significant updates or new features that you will **actually** use or utilize to its potential.

Unless you really want the always on display or the faster charging, then I wouldn’t. SE has really served me well, no regrets getting it over the 7. I have the one with cellular, no complaints here. If you really want the always on display, consider a used or refurbished series 5. I barely see a difference with the always on display if I had it, as I always seem to wear long sleeves anyways, which would completely defeat the purpose.**",material
3223,"I had the SE before, I didn’t upgrade but it’s a long story and now i have the S7, let me tell you that I wouldn’t really have upgraded, now the S7 is soooo nice, big screen, faster charging, keyboard, always on display and more health sensors, i would say if you don’t care about always on display, the screen difference isn’t something that you would notice, it is something that you get used to, if you got the SE believe me the bigger bezels aren’t that noticeable, and the faster charging is nice, but if you have time before sleep that you don’t need your watch the SE is good enough, the health sensors, well it depends you know more about yourself of course, hopefully I didn’t miss a lot, i would say that you won’t regret both, if you have any questions don’t be bothered to ask me 👍",material
3224,"I
Don’t think the ECG would actually work for you if you go by your real age. There’s a age requirement to use the feature.",material
3225,"SE, save your money and put the difference in a ROTH",material
3226,"I had the 7, returned and got SE. Didn't really need the extras.",material
3227,"Id go with the SE just because it can do almost everything the 7 can do. Another option that I’d highly recommend is to check third party retailers like Best Buy and Target, I saw the Series 6 for $250 on Best Buy one day which is an insane deal considering you aren’t missing out much from the 7",material
3228,"Unless you plan on getting stainless steel, just get an SE. I would opt for the 7 just for the sapphire display if you’re anything like me and have your tendency to bump your wrist against hard surfaces only while wearing a watch. 

If you’re super careful and don’t care about scratches, get the SE. 

Either way it goes, you only realize you bought an overpriced computer for your wrist (that still comes in handy sometimes) after you buy it. 

But someone here said it best: Buy what you can afford. We can’t justify your wallet. Only you can.",material
3229,I’m 14 too and I’m considering getting a SE Nike 44MM for my birthday,material
3230,"I went for the SE, had it a few days and it seems pretty good. Battery life is getting better and looks like it will run two days now. Most of the features of the 7 are there in some form, it doesn’t have ECG for instance but still checks for irregular heart and notifies.",material
3231,I don’t use the O2 sensor nor the ECG and still bought the series 7. The bigger screen is gorgeous and I like the new colours (starlight). I’m 28 and have a good job tho so thankfully for me the price gap between the SE and the Series 7 wasn’t a decisive factor. If you’re tight on money go for the SE. You’ll love it,material
3232,I’m also 14 and I have the SE 40mm and it’s perfect for me so I’d recommend the SE ;),material
3233,"I waited from July till 2 weeks ago for the 7 and wish I would’ve just bought the SE. Blood Oxygen and ECG are not useful for me and I doubt I will ever use it, I just thought they were gonna add more features but it’s whatever now.",material
3234,"It seems you’re only paying half for it, which means the SE would cost $140 and the S7 $200 (or a little more for the larger sizes). I recommend the S7, as the larger display alone is worth $60 to me.",material
3235,"I got a refurbished 6, seems like the 7 wasn’t much of an upgrade",material
3236,"The only difference between the se and the 7 is ecg, blood oxygen, always on display, and a larger display.

I would also look into the series 6. It’s slightly cheaper than the 7, but it does all the same things.

I’d say that the 6 or 7 is worth the extra money just because of the always on display. It makes it much more convenient to check the time while doing something like typing.",material
3237,"If someone is buying it for you, get the S7",material
3238,Dang it kid save your money for college unless you're parents are rich?,material
3239,The SE is litteral shit,material
3240,"Lmao nah, I think at least series 14.",material
3241,"Just wondering, would you still have stuck with the 7 if you weren’t planning to use it as much?",material
3242,Thanks a lot!,material
3243,"Ah okay, thanks for the honest opinion. I know the ECG and oxygen sensor aren’t important to me but just wondering would you consider the always on mode an important factor?",material
3244,"Thank you for the in depth answer, just wondering did the upgrade overall feel worth it?",material
3245,"Oh I didn’t know that, thanks, however I think I am mainly focused on other factors such as the screen size and always on mode.",others
3246,"Oh ok, any reasoning behind your choice?",material
3247,"Yeah I can stretch mine from Friday morning and have to put it on Sunday afternoon-night so I don’t have to worry about it on the weekends. 

I think my only negative is not having always on. I used to not mind, but if my band is just a little too loose, how I like it when I’m not working, it doesn’t activate.",material
3248,"Ok that’s good to hear, is there anything you feel your missing though?",material
3249,"That’s good to hear as screen size is a key factor I’m thinking about, thanks for the info!",material
3250,"Ah okay, thank you. Will the fact that the Apple Watch 6 has been discontinued affect anything?",material
3251,"Haha, I’m actually paying for half of it.",material
3252,"It’s really not. My friend has an SE, upgraded from Series 3 and he is super content! But I respect your opinion",others
3253,"I am wearing one right now, and I can confirm that it is in fact not literal shit.",material
3254,"Hmmm probably not. The SE is a really great option if you’re just using it mostly as a way to check notifications and activity progress. Lots of people claim that it’s really the best value for the price- it does almost everything the 7 can do.  I was on the SE train for a while until recently when reading more about the Always on screen. Personally, I’m an impatient person and would get easily annoyed if I lifted my wrist and didn’t see something right away. I’m also in a good place financially so I can afford to splurge on it. If your budget is tight, I recommend waiting until Black Friday/cyber monday and see if you can find any good deals on the SE, or the 5 and 6 are good options as well. Slickdeals.net is a site I use to track deals. 

Either way, you’re going to get a really great watch and if you have buyers remorse, you can likely return and switch pretty easily. Hope this helps!",others
3255,"I would say if you’re not used to wearing a watch, the AOD is nice to have but not essential at all, and the SE is an excellent choice. I was quite happy with my S3 when I had it. But I’ve got used to having always-on now, and I’d absolutely miss it if I went back to a watch without it.",material
3256,the always on and edge to edge screen make it worth it to me,material
3257,"Nope, you would barely notice it.",material
3258,"Did the same and would say yes if money isn’t an issue. Also depends what you’re going to use it for, personally I find always on display worth it as well as the new keyboard. However if you don’t find yourself using it to text people back much without using voice to text I’d go for the SE, as you’re young and better of saving the money or using it on something else.",material
3259,"Like i said I didn’t upgrade, sold the SE in july and bought this now, but I remember the SE and the exact experience, i can tell you the S7 is worth it if you can afford it without thinking twice about the money, and as a first watch yes, but for you like you said you don’t use your watch often, i would say the most important deciding factor for you is if you care about always on display or not.",material
3260,Then those will be the only other two benefits you will gain from 7 to SE. aluminum on 7 has more color options so there’s there’s a minor consideration. Then there’s the faster charging option for the 7.,material
3261,I don’t really want to drop 400 dollars on a Series 7 since I can’t or don’t need to use most of it’s features like ECG or blood oxygen. I want to get the Nike since it has more features without additional costs,material
3262,Not really. I’m still learning how the thing works to be honest. I don’t think the o2 reader or the ecg are worth the additional cost for my context.,others
3263,"No. Apple usually supports stuff for quite a while, they still support the Series 3 which came out 4 years ago.

They were also only recently discontinued, so you can still find them on amazon, and even some stores. I just got my series 6 last Sunday from an AT&T store. 

If you want to see what the series 6 looks like, go onto my profile. I just posted a pic of my watch to this sub yesterday",material
3264,"I think this is the most sensible answer in this thread. The Always On Display is the killer feature as it means you don’t have to raise your wrist to tell the time or to see if it’s a notification that’s worth stopping and raising your wrist for. More importantly, some apps, like Workouts continue to display metrics when your wrist is lowered eg let’s say you’re riding a bike or running, glancing at your wrist while it’s down let’s you still see the data. On an SE the screen is off so you need to raise to see the info. 

If this feature matters to you, then look into Series 6. 

If it doesn’t matter then SE.",material
3265,What did you decide in the end OP,material
3266,"Thanks that helps a lot, budget isn’t really an issue for me but I guess I’m leaning for the SE now.",material
3267,"Oh, that’s a shame, thank you though.",material
3268,"Money isn’t really an issue for me and yeah, I think the main thing I’m considering at the moment is the always on display. Thanks for the help.",material
3269,Oh right sorry and thanks for the info.,material
3270,"Yes that is true, I think right now I’m focused on how important I find those factors as there aren’t too many reasons to go for 7.",material
3271,"I see, thanks for the help!",material
3272,[deleted],others
3273,That’s quite true and I probably won’t be needing it. I guess the main factors I’m concerned about are the screen size and always on mode.,material
3274,"Ah okay, that’s something I’ll be thinking about, thanks.",material
3275,[deleted],others
3276,"No worries, you’re welcome 👍",material
3277,Also the 7 has a slightly better chip. May not seem like much but I imagine future OS updates in the years down from now it would help. It also has U1 which SE doesn’t have. All may seem minor but just some specs to consider about.,material
3278,"Actually, you get a bunch of exclusive Nike watch faces as well that are not available to be downloaded elsewhere.",material
3279,"I guess different folks will feel differently about that. I know the 7 has more screen but using the se it doesn’t feel dated or that the screen is small for me. The idea of always on mode is nice n all but I don’t know why I would need my watch screen on when I’m not looking at it, the rise to look thing on the se when I tilt my wrist works really well and brings the screen on. If I had the 7 I think I would disable aod. We all have different use cases though so that might be very different to yours.",material
3280,No problem. Generally speaking every Apple Watch is good for 3 years before really big new features are added (I’ve owned them since Series 0). Series 6 is from 2020 so you’re good till about Series 9 in 2023. Series 6 has exactly the same internals as a Series 7 minus fast charging.,material
3281,"There seems to be. I visited the website u/DIL3MMA mentioned and Target will roll out a deal for the SE in both sizes, the 40mm being $219. Big shoutout my guy, thanks!

I was unsure but I can’t really justify $180 more for the s7 as I’m really just using this as a workout device and notification checker.",material
3282,"That’s a good point, thanks.",material
3283,And you get to choose the Nike bands at first purchase which I think are better (especially the sport loop),material
3284,The S7 screen is nice but it definitely hasn’t made the S4-S6/SE design/screens feel immediately dated the way the S4 did to the S0-S3.,material
3285,"Yeah, I guess I can see always on being irritating so I think I’ll do a bit more research on that. Thanks for sharing.",material
