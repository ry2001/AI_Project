""This watch is basically a Series 6, but with a slightly larger display and slightly faster charge time.""

""This is now the most durable Apple Watch ever.""

""My disappointment with these new watches?  The color choices.  Apple doesn't offer a neutral color for the aluminum baseline Apple Watch.""",others
1,"It seems like most people who already have an AW are unimpressed by this update, but as somebody who is getting a series 7 as their first smart watch, can I just say I‚Äôm hype as hell for the fast charging and no bezels? I don‚Äôt even mind the colors that much, I went with midnight and I think it looks great",material
2,As someone who has a series 1 I‚Äôm definitely pumped! All of the reviews downplay it I think because the reviewers are techies that get review units each year. I will acknowledge I‚Äôm behind and it‚Äôs me that hasn‚Äôt updated. But I feel like we‚Äôre caught up in update culture. Where yes they could add more health features and a few more things but also the changes are so incremental because it‚Äôs such a good device in the first place.,material
3,"I imagine the space gray aluminum was the single most popular Apple Watch model. Getting rid of it was a pretty naked attempt at trying to force people into a SS or titanium, but I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out.",material
4,I am whelmed.,material
5,"Basically, it‚Äôs Apple Watch Series 6s?",material
6,Oh man does the green look great. It's a very dark almost army green and looks stunning in the videos. Incredibly happy I went with that over midnight (which looks black with a slight blue at certain angles in direct sunlight).,others
7,I'm still using Apple Watch 4. No motivation to buy that one. I will wait for a better update.,others
8,"I will say, seeing videos of the watches in natural light does help - the starlight looks about like how I expected in that champagne kind of color and the midnight and green are both a lot darker than I expected which is a pleasant surprise.",material
9,"Based on the videos, the midnight looks pretty black at first glance. You see the blue if you look at it carefully/in the right light. Might look different in person.",material
10,The keyboard is the seller for me,material
11,"I watched a couple of reviews and cancelled my preorder. Seeing it in real videos now, even with the thinner bezels it still just looks like the same watch which I‚Äôve never loved the design of. My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign, but I still decided to put an order in. But the lack of neutral colours on lower end bands forced me to go for the milanese loop along with the stainless steel to get something I liked the look of, and at that price it simply isn‚Äôt worth it for me. I‚Äôll wait for the series 8 to see if it has the new design and neutral bands.",others
12,"I have a day one series 3, and I think I might keep hanging on‚Ä¶",material
13,"If you have a Series 3 like me and were considering upgrading because of dreadful performance‚Ä¶. I strongly recommend installing watchOS 8.0.1 before ordering a new watch. 

It‚Äôs a major performance improvement and I‚Äôm now thinking of hanging on to this S3 for a little longer.",material
14,Waiting for another 38mm model. Or 36 w a full screen. These are just too bulky.,material
15,"Anyone who says this is an ‚ÄúS‚Äù year really doesn‚Äôt get how S models work.

The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is the literal opposite of an S year.",material
16,I DEMAND 120hz!!!,material
17,Even with these minor updates since last 2-3 years. AW is the best smartwatch and there is nothing even close. Shows you how other companies are far behind in the competition.,material
18,I wonder if it still works with the Belkin 3-in-1 Magsafe dock,material
19,"I‚Äôm debating on canceling my preorder after seeing these reviews. I‚Äôd be upgrading from a day one Series 4 with 80% battery health. 

I mainly upgraded so that I can have a good battery life again, get AOD and blood oxygen sensor. 

I‚Äôm seriously thinking of just getting a battery replacement and call it a year. It also doesn‚Äôt help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS.",material
20,I have a space gray S4. I was considering going to the S7 but no way am I paying for $800 for Space Black Titanium. Tim Apple has let me down on this one,material
21,"As an owner of a Series 6 Nike Edition watch, I'll be holding out for the future release that includes a blood glucose sensor.      With the cost of the sensors that you can wear for 14 days of continuous blood glucose monitoring, the Apple Watch series that does that feature will be well worth the upgrade.",material
22,Looks like I‚Äôm sticking with my series 1 for the time being üòÖ,material
23,"It's bizarre to me how much complaining there is about the Starlight and Midnight color options in this thread for a few reasons:

1) They're still super close to Silver and Space Grey. A hint of gold or blue does not make them ""not neutral,"" and anybody who isn't up on Apple color conventions is still going to look at them and think they look silver or dark grey. 

2) Why does it matter if they're neutral in the first place? You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. No, the Space Black Ti model is not going to look more professional/less gadgety than the Midnight Al.",others
24,Did anybody get the Gold SS (or any SS) review models?,material
25,No hands on with the blue?,material
26,Is the fast charging exclusive to the 7 or can I now buy a fast charger for my SE? Every once in a while I have my head up my ass ass and forget to charge when I have a good opportunity.,material
27,"I wonder if Apple will ever update the aluminum version of the apple watch with a sapphire display. My series 3 aluminum face is scratched to hell, but the massive increase in price to the steel/ceramic/titanium just seems not worth it.",material
28,"This is the 2nd apple device that I may upgrade too only because I regret my previous purchase. 


I got the iPhone 13 pro only because I regret getting the iPhone 12 with no telephoto lens, and I might get the series 7 only because I regret getting the SE with no always on display. Neither seem like enticing options if I made the correct choice with the 12 pro/series 6 last year.",material
29,so the s7 SiP is the same as the s6 SiP???,material
30,"I ordered one because It‚Äôs more trouble to buy a cheaper 6 from going to another country rather than get the 7 delivered to my door. 

First AW btw. I‚Äôve only used it briefly for a week because a friend borrowed it to me so I can get a reference to compare it to the gwa2 I had.",material
31,I‚Äôm excited for my watch coming this Friday. Going to be upgrading from a Series 1!,material
32,Have a stainless with Milanese loop 45mm coming as my first Apple Watch. I‚Äôm very excited!! I don‚Äôt know too much about the features which makes me even more excited!,material
33,My new 7 is taking forever to charge and doesn‚Äôt hold a charge.  What chargers is everyone using and how long to charge?  15 mins?!  I wish!,material
34,So that whole announcement about it having really durable crystal across the board was a lie and it‚Äôs just glass and crystal on the stainless still?,material
35,"Well the hands on real world footage has shown clearly what I was worried about

The screen going so far edge to edge with such a curvy bit of glass looks weird

Looks to me like the screen is too big for the watch. The way the reflective edge obscures the display just doesn‚Äôt look all that great

The display no longer looks like its on top of the glass, it looks like its trapped behind the glass

And now I‚Äôm convinced that this will look great with a flatter redesign that I suspect we will get next year (if it wasn‚Äôt originally planned for this year)",material
36,"I mean just get a Series 6 which will probably discounted by retailers or off eBay. I got a series 5 stainless steel in January, heavily discounted and can see myself holding onto this for a while",others
37,"Yeh I also thought this with the ‚Äúleaked‚Äù design, them squared edges don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôll be too nice when bending my wrist. And yes before anyone mentions it, I know traditional, analog can watches have squared edges and are bulky",others
38,I don‚Äôt see them doing a flat design any time soon. The sensors would need to be completely redesigned to accommodate it. As it stands they protrude out the back of the watch significantly. They get away with it in part because of the curvature of the watch.,material
39,"The fifteen minutes of charging for 8 hours of sleep tracking does sound really nice, as I use my watch as a sleep tracker / alarm clock. Definitely feeling the upgrade pull from a series 3 to 7.",material
40,This is a good summary. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶basically it for changes.,material
41,"Coming from a wifi only Series 4, it‚Äôs a slightly better upgrade to the 7 cellular. Other than going for walks without my phone with me now, I doubt I‚Äôm going to be using it any differently.",material
42,Did I miss an incredibly small one-liner or did he not even address battery life?,energy
43,"Seems marques has been getting sloppy with the fact checking. He mentions you can dive with the watch because it has 5ATM water resistance.

Do NOT dive with it. I wouldn‚Äôt even use it for water sports like surfing. 5ATM basically allows for swimming in a pool and showering, doing more is risking it. If you want to do snorkeling you need at least 10ATM and for skin diving it should be 20ATM. 

Free and scuba diving are another beast and those watches need to pass a different certification (ISO 6425) so they are advertised with the word Diver‚Äôs before the rating.",others
44,Since when aren‚Äôt black and silver neutral colours?,others
45,"You‚Äôre definitely part of the target audience for the Series 7. I think people forget that for anyone thinking about upgrading from a Series 4 or older, this is a pretty significant upgrade.",material
46,Exactly the same here!,material
47,Same here! My first one. I'm only bummed by the removing of space grey color but i'll live with the midnight,material
48,"Very excited here as well! I am upgrading from an OG Galaxy Watch. I was a recent Android convert, and this will be my first Apple Watch. 

Looking forward to the integration and overall polish, as that was dearly lacking on the OG Galaxy Watch.",material
49,"I‚Äôm excited for mine, finally broke my series 2 a couple weeks ago",material
50,">no bezels

It's not like the Series 4, 5, SE, or 6 had much of a bezel to begin with.",material
51,"It's just like phones - it's an incremental upgrade from the previous generation, but it's really aimed at people who haven't upgraded for 2+ years.  For them, it's a large jump.",material
52,I mean I‚Äôm hyped as well upgrading from a Series 0 lmao‚Ä¶,material
53,"Yeah, I'm digging that midnight. Waiting for mine to arrive.

Up to everyone's taste ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",material
54,"Same here, I think all the people with recent watches are missing the point. The tech is mature enough that upgrading every year or two is pointless and wasteful.",material
55,You should see the screenshots and texts between me and my buddy.  We are very excited for midnight,material
56,Basically the Verge‚Äôs video conclusion lmao.,material
57,I‚Äôll be coming form a S4. So there‚Äôs some new shit for me.,material
58,Your hype is totally justified! I jumped on the AW train last year with the S6 which was similarly received and I felt just as you described. I hope you love your new S7!,material
59,I wonder if they‚Äôll also phase out silver and space grey on the new MacBooks (in favour of Starlight and Midnight). Currently I don‚Äôt think any of the recently refreshed products have any silver/space grey aluminum which is a bit odd.,material
60,"Removing neutral colors (black and white) from the base iPhone 13 lineup this year didn‚Äôt seem to slow down sales, even though they were probably the most popular colors.",material
61,"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve calculated these losses go one they didn‚Äôt even need to build a new chipset. This, internally, is the same processor then the S6. That‚Äôs where most of the money in R&D goes, and they didn‚Äôt need to spend a single dollar this year on making it better.",material
62,"The only reason I bought a model other than the aluminum was for the sapphire screen. In hindsight, it was worth it, but I wish they would let all models have the sapphire rather than just the premium",material
63,"> I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out  

Yeah right now I'm waiting to see if any S6 deals are on the go (UK) or go cheapsies on the SE. Was more than happy to go in on the big new thing but what a jip.  

Edit: None have seemingly dropped from the current price that I've seen yet but likely will once they get S7 stock...",material
64,"probably. i know i have no interest in buying a *heavier* and less shatter/crack resistant Watch just to get a color i like when that Watch is also more expensive and whose main purpose is fitness tracking.

but also, the only reason i'd replace my Series 5 with a 7 is if the battery degrades sufficiently to bug me and i can't wait for a Series 8 or whatever. there's just not anything exciting about the 7 to me.",material
65,"I'm sure you're right, but I'm still using a Series 4 and I have to say the improvements on the Series 7 seemed like a good enough jump for me.  Nicer/more durable screen, fast charging, and brighter always on display (which I have yet to experience on an Apple Watch) sold me on it.  

They didn't have the exact color I wanted, but for me the hardware updates and features matter more",others
66,"Of the three people who I know who have apple watches, they‚Äôre all getting midnight and are excited after todays pics and videos",others
67,I doubt it. Some of these colors are REALLY neutral. Heck apparently the very green one is more or less gray in anything but ideal lighting.,others
68,Don‚Äôt think apple will ever bring space Grey back for any of their products. It‚Äôll be more of graphite. A darker shade. I‚Äôll expect MacBook Pro to follow suit. Basically all of the pro products will have similar colour range. AW SS imo falls under the pro range,material
69,This is definitely one of the Apple Watches ever released,material
70,4s^3,material
71,"Ehh I'd only expect spec bumps for an S. 20% larger screen, faster charging but no spec bump is... it's own minor thing.",others
72,and it's not like the Series 6 was anything more than a Series 5 with a gimmicky Spo2 sensor.,others
73,"No. S years are by definition the same external design and more major internal improvements. 

The Series 7 is the opposite of this: new external design and lesser overall improvements.",material
74,"Given the iPhone 6S was one of the most comprehensive internal revamps of all time, not exactly relevant.",others
75,"Same here. I can‚Äôt figure out why the green isn‚Äôt more popular. I got the clover solo loop but man, the black bands paired with the green watch sure look great.",material
76,"I wasn‚Äôt complaining, I missed preorder by far, but green was still available for day 1 store pickup by midday.",material
77,What‚Äôs the battery health on your S4?,material
78,I‚Äôm definitely getting the series 8 if my watch makes it to then.,material
79,I broke my Apple Watch 4 a couple months ago and have no motivation to buy this. The incremental watch updates are killing me.,material
80,"I‚Äôm totally happy with the physical design of it, but there‚Äôs nothing this year that makes it a worthwhile upgrade. For me, the two biggest things that I‚Äôd be excited for are either a significant upgrade to battery life, or some new health-tracking features enabled by new hardware. Anything else is kinda ‚Äúwell I guess a slightly larger screen is nice but not $400 nice‚Äù.",material
81,"> My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign

I just cannot understand the logic behind wanting redesigns on things just for the sake of having them redesigned... It's a smart watch with an extremely limited form factor, what are you expecting? Will square sides chuff your bits?",material
82,Hard edge Apple Watch would suck for working out / sports,material
83,"Same, cancelled and ordered couple new bands instead to clench that consumer thirst",material
84,"Series 3 gang üòé I‚Äôll be honest I haven‚Äôt really been tempted by any of the EKG or blood O2 stuff in the new ones, seem kinda gimmicky. I think I‚Äôll be rocking the 3 for a while",material
85,Same,material
86,"Same. When this was announced I was all in. Then as time went on, the shiny idea went away and my s3 still does what I need and doesn‚Äôt cost me $800. Gonna use that to replace my aging iMac",material
87,Yeah I agree. I cleared everything and installed 8.0.1 and it feels like a new watch somehow. I‚Äôm still going to check out my ss series 7 when it comes in for a week then make my decision.,material
88,"> The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is not the official definition though. And no one is calling it the ""S"" model like it is an official thing. 

> This is the literal opposite of an S year.

The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature. None of those really apply here.",others
89,‚Äú but I need something new and drastic every year!!!!!!‚Äù,material
90,I think all of us that use an analog watch face agree that its ridiculous that we don't have 120Hz or higher yet. Watching the second hand move on my current Apple watch only compels me to stab my eyes out with an Apple Pencil.,material
91,It does it just doesn‚Äôt fast charge.,material
92,"If you‚Äôre able to, couldn‚Äôt you get a Series 6? I just got one, it‚Äôs a great device and one that could last me a few generations. I imagine the series 6 will do the same for you.",material
93,Same boat as you. Might end up canceling my preorder as well.,material
94,"As I have a series 4, I cancelled my series 7 pre-order that would have been arriving this Friday. I think I can be patient enough for another few generations.",material
95,"I had a steel Series 4 with 75% battery health, and right after the Series 7 was announced I was on the phone with Apple to get a battery replacement.

Now I‚Äôve got a Series 4 with a fresh battery that looks brand new (so shiny without all the scratches!) and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my decision.

I‚Äôll probably upgrade next year if the Series 8 gets those rumoured new health sensors. AOD would be cool too.",others
96,">It also doesn‚Äôt help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS

From what I've seen the reviews, Midnight honestly [looks closer to black](https://i.redd.it/xc3cprrt19t71.jpg) than Space Gray ever did. It has a slight blue sheen in certain lighting, but it's super subtle to the point where black bands match it better than the Midnight ones.

It's almost making me regret getting black Ti, but I still think that also looks great so I'm going to keep it for now.",material
97,I mean the ‚Äúgraphite‚Äù stainless steel model seems pretty black to me,material
98,‚Ä¶so get aluminum‚Ä¶?,material
99,what would they have to add to entice you? curious,material
100,"Fair play. I went from S1 to S4 and it was a big jump, but every year since has been underwhelming. 

Not that I know what I want from a smart watch these days. Maybe just battery, everything is fine.",material
101,"> You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. 

I don't think the problem is embracing whether they are trying to hide the fact that they have an Apple Watch or not. The problem is how well the colors go with your bands, outfits, and ""lifestyle"". A neutral watch is likely to blend with their choices. 

A red Apple Watch will not go with how I dress for work, or socially. It won't even match half the bands I bought for my space gray watch. So while I really like the color, I won't get that color.",material
102,">	Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like.

The colour that I like is no longer available. That‚Äôs the problem.",others
103,"I think this is just all wild speculative whining driven by the absence of being able to hold a watch in your hand and having to go by product images online. As soon as they're released, I expect very few actual complaints in real world use.

I've been a participant in this before: When every Apple 'news' site broadcasted that the MagSafe Duo was possibly incompatible with the iPhone 13 Pro I was aghast and fretting over it. Only to receive the phone and charge it every night on it without any issue. Not exactly the same, but its no point in getting so worked up over something until you actually have it in your hand.",others
104,It looks like everyone has been getting the green one for their reviews so far.,material
105,"Yep, 7 only",material
106,The sapphire is more scratch resistant but also heavier and more brittle (prone to shattering). The ion-glass is much better for the ‚Äúsports/fitness‚Äù model.,material
107,"I know it adds a little bulk, but the there are so many bumper styles out for for super cheap.  I‚Äôd highly recommend; they‚Äôve saved my A3 on dozens of occasions.",others
108,Yes,material
109,"I agree it looked that way, but if you take a close look at the watch when it's on your wrist, it's really the sensor on the bottom that has contact on your skin, not the edges of the watch. In fact, short of bending my wrist straight up, I can't even get myself to contact the sides.  That's just to say that I think the more angular design wouldn't be an issue in practice.",material
110,"Oh if you have a series 3 there‚Äôs no question you should upgrade. 

Also Tommy rules!",material
111,"True, but saying only ‚Äúslightly larger display‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really imply the functional upgrade of the revised UI to go with it that can show 50% more text on screen, and has a keyboard etc.

For me, being able to read messages/emails that are 50% longer without having to bring up my other hand to scroll through them is a pretty important upgrade.",material

114,He mentions battery life in the video.,material
115,"he addressed on battery and recharge 

while battery life is the same. quick charge fits his life style much better",energy
116,"there's not anything new there really. battery life is the same as it's always been ('fine' to 'mediocre' depending on how you use the Watch), but it charges faster so you can just do a quick charge at night or in the morning if you find some benefit to sleep tracking and be fine.",material
117,Also watch your bands. I used a sports band and jumped off a rock about 10 feet up and lost my watch on impact (on the second jump). The river was not clear and it was lost forever.,material

123,Same I‚Äôm excited - also getting my first cellular model,material
124,"Oddly, the new iPad mini has Starlight and Space Grey.",material
125,"I doubt they'd do that. Maybe we'll see MacBooks come in color options similar to the iMacs, but I don't think they're going to release new colorways to match watches. The watch is unique among Apple offerings because it's a fashion accessory as much as it is a tech product. The people who think all Apple products should be color-matched are looking at it the wrong way, imo. The watches need to be matched with clothing, not MacBooks.",others
126,"At least you can (and most likely do) put a cover on a phone, with the watch you're stuck with what you've got.",material
127,"For me the color matters much more for a watch than a phone. You‚Äôre likely not putting a case on it, and it‚Äôs part of your outfit.",material
128,"If it‚Äôs about the durability of the display, I‚Äôve been buying some cheap glass screen protectors for my aluminum AWS6 from AliExpress that use LOCA and a UV light. Very sleek and since it‚Äôs glass I‚Äôve found I don‚Äôt notice it if you put it on right.

Obviously not as premium as sapphire crystal, but my wrist is at the perfect height to bang into doorknobs and my quartz countertops - sometimes it‚Äôll crack but then I just replace the protector. Could be an option for people more budget -minded (read: cheap) like myself lol",material
129,I‚Äôn from NL and found a 40mm Series 6 on Amazon for 299 a few weeks ago. That was enough reason for me the take the S6 and not wait for the S7. Best choice ever after seeing these reviews.,material

131,Apple Watch Series 6 Pro Max,material
132,">I can‚Äôt figure out why the green isn‚Äôt more popular

The answer to the question ""Why isn't x color more popular"" when it comes to fashion accessories is pretty simple. Most colors outside of black, white, gold, and brown just don't go together nicely with most people's clothing choices, and this green color on the Series 7 looks like it unfortunately falls into that camp.

Never mind the fact that conventional mechanical watches are almost always found in those colors as well.",others
133,"I went in 50/50 between green and midnight but I ended up looking in my closet to make up my mind. The green would work with my weekend clothes but it‚Äôs just not right for my black, blue, and gray heavy business attire, and (rather unfortunately) I‚Äôm in the business clothes many more hours than my casual clothes during the Monday through Friday time period when I‚Äôll actually need to use a watch. Still would have preferred graphite to match my 13 Pro but I‚Äôm staying open minded about the midnight.",material

138,"It‚Äôs important to me that it looks good, and for me the rumoured redesign was a significant aesthetic improvement over the current design.",material
139,"I‚Äôm on an s4 so I have those, and yeah, totally minor things. The only reason I‚Äôm even entertaining updating is I‚Äôve been dying for the always on screen, and my watch is getting fairly beat up after years of daily use‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt like the colors of the aluminum and would never go to the stainless, and the idea of buying last years product when it‚Äôs still so expensive just seems wrong to me.

I really wanted to upgrade, but everything about this watch feels like a minor revision, and that they plan for something much more significant next year. And if not, well, we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶",material
140,">The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature.

TouchID was a pretty valuable feature. And as far as redesigns go, it's S7 is probably more substantial than going from iPhone 6S to 7 was. Same with XS to 11.",material
141,"Not saying it‚Äôs a definition, but that‚Äôs always how S models worked.

3GS identical to 3G
4S identical to 4
5s near identical to 5, with home button changed for Touch ID 
6s identical to 6
XS identical to X

It would make more sense to call the S6 ‚ÄúSeries 5s‚Äù than to call Series 7 a ‚ÄúSeries 6s‚Äù",material

Fair enough! Worth mentioning that one of these options is used though and probably won't come with the same warranty and might not be in the same condition or have the same battery health.

I mean they were pretty clear that the extra room for text was the result of the UI being redesigned, not *just* because the screen is larger. They had a whole section of the presentation dedicated to that UI redesign.

I also kind of doubt that the reason they didn't cram more text in before was simply to sell us on a larger screen 3 years later.

They might have the same pack shape for manufacturing simplicity but there's no way it's sitting on that much extra range without being paid for. The upgrades are full self driving and a soft lock on some 0-60 performance for the AWD non performance models. That software lock does NOT get it all the way up to the performance model, it only unlocks residual performance from the motors. The rear motor is >200hp on its own (though the torque is software restricted at low speed to avoid torque ripple effects), but adding the (more powerful, no ripple effects) front motor only brings it up to about 350hp. The $2k power bump unlocks the missing chunk given the limitations of the long range model as is, and the actual Performance model has some additional stuff (though the motors are, at their core, the same) to provide the last bit of performance, my guess would be some improved materials to keep up reliability with all the extra torque.

There was one point in time where the model S was selling 70kwh models that actually had 80kwh batteries, but that was for two reasons: They'd stopped making the 70kwh battery pack, and restricting the 80kwh battery to 70kwh usable actually improved usable life (and it wasn't NEARLY as big a jump as the current model 3 standard->long range models).

Also, agreed on the hype and marketing. But you can be sure this hype and marketing would Not have worked with an esthetically un pleasing watch.

Also, visual comparisons between transreflective and OLED screens say otherwise against your statement that ""they look just as good"". You were probably right if you compared a transreflective display against one of the first smartwatches in the market with incredibly dim and poorly color accurate LCD and TFT displays (looking at you LG Watch first Gen, and first Gen Sony Smartwatch), but modern smartwatches have gotten crazy bright and good. And transreflective displays simply can't hold a candle to them. Just take a look at this comparison of Garmin watches using OLED and transreflective displays
https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-venu-vs-garmin-vivoactive-4-7826

The transreflective one makes blacks look like grays, and colors look dull and flat. Giving it a near sticker like appearance. 

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying transreflective screens are bad. In fact, I still use my pebble time from time to time when I go to the office and even get some complements on it. It's nice forgetting to even charge it for weeks. But if there's an important gathering or I'm going out, I'll always wear my Galaxy Watch with its gorgeous display that can show an adecuate watch face for the occasion fitting my outfits colors with great color accuracy.

Because whether we like it or not, we must accept smartwatches took off because they became in part, a fashion accessory. With functionality second. 

Does that mean transreflective displays are bad? Absolutely not. I'm just trying to see why they didn't take off with the mainstream market. And why what success they've had, are with niche audiences of power users that are the rare kind of people that do value functionality over looks, like you and me.",material

But to answer your question, aluminium can corrode. The aluminium on the apple watch is probably anodized, so it is already corroded to begin with (controlled corrosion which is also dyed for the colour). The more corroded it gets, the slower it corrodes further (unlike steel which just corrodes constantly, aluminium corrosion is a protective layer).

In some circumstances aluminium can get a very agressive corrosion which is quite nasty (e.g. in salt water, alloy boat engines can corrode badly... maybe something similar on a tiny scale can occur on your hand too, with salty sweat...).",others

The apple watch sends you constant reminders, incentives and encouragement to close your ring, beat your target, and overall be more active. On top of that they also allow you to share this data with friends, so you compete to see who gets more points.

This is simple, but Apple did the difficult part. They perfected the balance between annoying and useful and made very smart decisions on which information to present. Active calories for example is a great ideal instead of total, or exercise only, because its abstract enough to cover everyday things like going up stairs but also skews towards exercise.

Then there are nice behind the scenes things. For example, the apple watch easily syncs with myfitnesspal so I can track my calorie goals and activity in the same place. The health app connects with my Withings scale, so it tracks my weight and body composition.

I'm extremely critical of the Apple Watch because it looks like trash, battery life is way too short (gotta charge it every day), and performance is meh. But I keep coming back to it.

Sure, it‚Äôs likely not as good of a sensor you‚Äôd use in a hospital but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction. People might not know how to read it.  That‚Äôs why you go see your doctor and let them interpret it. This use of smart watches is a great, maybe the best and most unanticipated use case for the smartwatch. A good thing that needs to be carefully encouraged and used, so long as people don‚Äôt use it in lieu of a medical professional but rather to assist them.

Like other sensors, the information is likely recorded over time by Apple‚Äôs Health app. Which also picks up info from my doctor‚Äôs office online medical records system for my review or use, and I believe the Health app can feed data the other way too, notably things like home BP readings, etc.  Not sure of that one, though. 

Assisting the docs is the key.

An INFORMED opinion is the only useful kind. If you express your opinion but can‚Äôt inform people with facts and detail when you are questioned about it just shows your opinion is worthless. Getting on your high horse when I dare to ask questions is even worse. ESPECIALLY from a ‚Äúmedical professional‚Äù like earlier in this thread. In that case it‚Äôs absolutely unprofessional and proves their opinion is worthless.

Seems like in general people forget about exchange rates a lot, when I see other Canadians or also Australians reading news from US sources, or about US made products. It can be confusing sometimes, considering we all use dollars, but anything you see online in reviews and such is probably in USD, so add a bit more to convert to Canadian and add a lot more to convert to Australian, basically. It'll usually equal out to be the same give or take a tiny bit.

Edit: I should note I'm talking from a Canadian perspective. I know in India, Apple devices cost marginally more, even when you convert it. I would chalk that up to shipping fees, considering India is a very competitive market. Apparently Australia has some problems like that too but I wouldn't know. The relatively small difference in price when you convert it is probably just because shipping and such (and also the fact that retailers use static prices, ie $599, where exchange rates change often, meaning price differences can grow or shrink). I'm just assuming mainly here.

Another edit: just an example I searched up. The S20 Ultra is $1399 regular price from Samsung directly. Here in Canada, it's like $1840 or $1850. That's the exact exchange rate.",material

What is most important to you in a smartwatch?

Sure, the top-of-the-line Apple Watch Series 6 can do that stuff but so can models that cost far less.

If you have already got a two- or three-year-old Apple Watch, the gains with this new model aren‚Äôt substantial. Same screen, same battery life, same core functionality. And I found this year‚Äôs standout health feature‚Äîa blood-oxygen sensor‚Äînot ready for prime time, not to mention not useful.

Plus, if you‚Äôre a first timer, or in need of an upgrade, Apple now has two other lower-cost options: the Apple Watch SE and Series 3. Actually, make that three: The best deal going right now might be a refurbished Series 5.

It is OK to be confused. I‚Äôm here for you. After testing all the models last week‚Äîalong with the $330 Fitbit FIT 0.23% Sense‚ÄîI have arrived at a new theory of Watch-Nomics: You should upgrade your Apple Watch every three to five years. Any sooner, and spending more on a watch doesn‚Äôt mean proportionally more features. So make the call on your needed features, then make a purchase.

The Choices

Remember your SAT multiple-choice tactics? Eliminate two choices and you suddenly have a 50/50 shot at a correct pick. Buying an Apple Watch is like that:


Do not collect them all! The Apple Watch Series 3, SE and Series 6, all on one wrist, from left to right.
A) Apple Watch Series 6 ($399): This one has the larger screen introduced in 2018, with an always-on display showing the time. It now has a slightly faster processor, slightly faster charging and the full health package, including an ECG electrical heart-rate sensor and new blood-oxygen sensor.

B) Refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 ($329): It‚Äôs basically a Series 6 without the blood-oxygen sensor. Apple stopped marketing it, but at time of publication, you could still find some variations in its refurbished store.

C) Apple Watch Series SE ($279): This resembles a Series 5 or 6, but without the always-on display, ECG or blood-oxygen sensor. It still has heart-rate tracking and notifications for high, low and irregular heart rate, as well as fall detection.

D) Apple Watch Series 3 ($199): OK, almost there. This one has an older design with a smaller screen, slightly shorter battery life and slower performance. It also has heart-rate tracking and heart-rate notifications, but no fall detection.

The Features

I anticipate most will choose A or C, especially if Apple runs out of refurbished Series 5s. So the real question is this: Are a blood-oxygen sensor, an ECG and an always-on display worth $120?

When I got the blood-oxygen sensor to work, most of my readings were in the healthy high-90% range. During a visit to my doctor, the watch even compared point for point with a medical-grade vital-signs monitor. However, often when I would manually initiate the 15-second test, I would get an ‚ÄúUnsuccessful Measurement,‚Äù indicating that the test didn‚Äôt work. Sometimes I would get a lower reading, like 94%‚Äîeven when my trusty $45 Walgreen‚Äôs pulse oximeter said 99%.

The little disco ball of green and red lights on the back of the watch needs to be steady, flush and tight against the skin to get a reading. The new, wonderfully comfortable Solo Loop straps help with that, but apparently mine was a bit too loose. Sliding the watch up my wrist a bit more has improved this. Still, using this is far too unreliable and inaccurate‚Äîeven if Apple doesn‚Äôt suggest this for medical use.


The Series 6 measures blood-oxygen levels, though not as reliably as a dedicated pulse oximeter.

Often after the 15-second blood-oxygen test, this ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" notification would appear. Sliding the watch up the wrist tended to fix the issue.
An Apple spokesman provided this statement: ‚ÄúThe Blood Oxygen feature has been rigorously tested across a wide spectrum of users and across all skin tones. For a small percentage of users, various factors may make it difficult to get a blood oxygen measurement including motion, watch placement on the wrist, skin temperature and skin perfusion.‚Äù

But even if this all worked, there isn‚Äôt a clear enough reason for me to need this on my wrist all the time. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just pull out a pulse oximeter if I‚Äôm worried? While a low blood-oxygen level can be a gauge for the severity of Covid-19 and other conditions, there is no Apple Watch alert if yours drops below a certain threshold.

Apple says this is a wellness and fitness feature, not a health one, and it is beneficial to those who travel to places with higher altitudes or who are involved in performance training. Also, much like the heart-rate sensor, which is proving to be central to Covid-19 wearable studies, the blood-oxygen sensor can now be used to collect data to build detection algorithms and further medical research.

As for the always-on display, while I do appreciate being able to glance down and see the time without tapping on my wrist, I have had it disabled on my Series 5 for most of the year to eke out a bit more battery life. I‚Äôm even more interested in saving battery now that sleep tracking arrived with WatchOS 7.

No matter which model you pick, you have to recharge every day or so. If you sleep with your watch, you have to charge it when you wake up. Compare that to the $330 Fitbit Sense, which I charge every five days or so. It keeps tabs on your temperature, blood oxygen and heart rate. That said, it lacks a lot of the non-health functionality of the Apple Watch, and Fitbit‚Äôs software can be slow and buggy.

The ECG is really the only feature I would consider for the extra money. You have to follow your heart on that one (sorry, had to.) It‚Äôs a shame Apple pulled a vital health feature from the former Series 4 or 5 model it‚Äôs now calling SE.

The Future

Rewind the clock to 5¬Ω years ago to when the Apple Watch first shipped, and the technical leaps are massive‚Äîwaterproofing, bigger screens, better battery life, advanced sensors. Alongside those leaps, the product found its central purpose: fitness and health.

But it was mostly there with the Series 4. So why has development slowed to a snail‚Äôs pace since then? There could be two reasons: Apple engineers haven‚Äôt quite gotten the next major improvements right (multiday battery life in a thinner package), and Apple realized no one wants to buy a watch every two years like a smartphone. It makes you wonder why we need yearly updates on these at all?


The new Solo Loop bands don't have any clasps or buckles. You just slide your wrist into the stretch band.

Big leaps are still coming. I had a vision of it when I was hooked up to that monitor at my doctor‚Äôs office. The Series 6 already does two of the four readings: pulse and blood-oxygen levels. Temperature and blood pressure? Not yet. By combining more advanced health sensors and software that detects fluctuations, the Apple Watch and other wearables are going to become our ever-present health care minders.

In the here and now, though, the answer isn‚Äôt to buy a new one whenever a sensor gets added‚Äîespecially when it doesn‚Äôt necessarily work. If you have an older model, grab a pulse oximeter from your drugstore and the super comfy $49 Solo Loop band from an Apple Store and call it a day. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt Series 6 it.",others
1074,"I‚Äôm actually kind of tired of the non-fitness people lamenting how useless the updates are. I trail run, hike, and road run, among other things, and the pulse oximeter and always-on altimeter is very nice to have, as well as the added battery life on outdoor runs. NONE of them seem to be mentioning these kinds of use-cases.",material

1093,"Apple Watch 6 44mm GPS+LTE Red edition

The watch as we know isn‚Äôt much of an upgrade from the 5.
The new features are basically the blood oxygen, the faster s6 chip, the new ultra wide U1 chip and the faster charging time of 1.5 hours and of course the 20% brighter always on display.

So here‚Äôs my take on the features it‚Äôs supposed to stand out from the watch 5.

1. I personally didn‚Äôt find the watch to be surprisingly faster than the watch 5 unless I was booting up or running tons of apps in the background.
2. The watch was the same brightness when on but was much much brighter when out in the sun and direct sunlight was hitting the displays. Indoors the always on display looks almost of the same brightness, except the colours on the 6 looks more crisper.
3. I compared the blood oxygen sensing to that of an hospital‚Äôs (I went for a test) as well as a local pulse oximetry device. The watch did accurate readings when hand was super stable and was worn higher up the wrist than usual. The blood oxygen levels measured during sleep were somewhat accurate too. The readings were almost same as the pulse oximetry device and almost came close to the hospital grade machine. 
4. Battery time took a hit since I had the LTE edition and I workout everyday for 6 hours so tracking that might have been a battery killer apart from the noise app which was also flagged to be dropping battery for others.
5. I can‚Äôt comment on the ultra wide U1 chip yet because I didn‚Äôt find much of a use for it. 

Overall I felt that the faster charging and brighter always on display were fantastic but at the same time I‚Äôm dejected that Apple didn‚Äôt make something ground breaking this year, I can understand that the people working at Apple had to manage COVID at the same time. 

If you‚Äôre planning on upgrading from a watch such as the 1,2,3 edition or maybe from nothing to an Apple Watch and want the fastest, brightest and health conscious watch and don‚Äôt care about the bucks you gotta spend this is the one for you. 
But if you are already having a 4 or 5 edition, spending the bucks on a watch with just 10% more features isn‚Äôt worth the value. Maybe wait for 7 or 8 to come with better features.",others

While the watch has some awareness of how long you were in bed and unconscious, there‚Äôs no data on the quality of your slumber -- nothing on how much deep, dreamy sleep you got versus a light doze.

Note that third party sleep tracking apps are great. I‚Äôve been using autosleep for years and it massively improved my sleep, which has made a huge difference in my daily energy.

1546,"/u/swimbrief, adding you too. So, I think it depends on the issues you had. For me, I had bad sleep for years. Hard to fall asleep, easy to wake up in the morning. Sleep tracking let me try different things and measure whether they worked. 

There were some other benefits too. The tracking sums up your average sleep over a week. If I felt a bit tired but my average was good, prob didn‚Äôt need to plan on a nap. If I felt tired and average was bad, probably did. 

I could also see how different foods affected my sleeping heart rate and deep sleep. I figured out certain food triggers and eliminated them. (I often felt worse with these foods, but sometimes I also wake up tired without them. So having the numbers let me make better decisions). 

The waking hrv feature of autosleep is also useful. I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a decent indicator of how hard I can push myself in a workout on a given day. 

If you fall asleep whenever you want and sleep like a baby, there‚Äôs no need for tracking. But if you have any sleep issues it‚Äôs super helpful.

* Eating earlier in the day: both breakfast + final meal
* blackout blinds
* low dose melatonin

You hit the nail on the head, it integrates seamlessly with the Apple garden. And once you start to build the garden walls high enough, that‚Äôs when the watch, airtag, tv, HomeKit, etc becomes worth it. 

Homekit alone will be the main reason for years to come that I‚Äôll continue to upgrade AWs every 2-3 years.",others
1576,"When i was at the office and when traveling a lot, I found having information and notifications on the wrist was a huge convenience.  However over the last year, working at home, I basically don't need it at all.  I wear it for the time mostly but I keep it in DND mode so all of the notifications alert on the phone.  So it really depends on who you are and how you use it.  One thing I to still appreciate is accepting 2FA for logging in to work.  I must use that at least 10 times a day and I like just tapping the watch to accept.

For the light user the SE or previous year's model is probably a better buy. 

LTE is a waste of money IMO as I have found very few practical use cases for it.  After two years of having it, I disconnected the LTE.

What is worth it is the stainless steel, but only if you plan to keep the watch or four years.  As it is the SS includes LTE anyway, but I would recommend just not paying for LTE (unless one wants to try it for a while to satisfy the curiosity.)  If they had a cheaper SS without LTE, i would recommend THAT one.  The sapphire crystal on my black SS S4 is still pristine (unscratched) unlike how my series 2 got pretty beat up over the two years I had it.  If you want the crystal to stay unscratched, it's worth paying for the SS model (especially the black with the coating.)  If you think you want to upgrade in a couple of years, I would save the money and stick with aluminum or an SE.

I personally don't think I'll upgrade until like series 7?  I just don't think I'll find it worth upgrading until blood glucose is added or my watch dies.  But I am still paying or AC+ so maybe I'll get it ""battery serviced"" and keep going?

I find the ceramic, titanium, and other premium models are probably just throwing money away but they do exist for people who want the splurge or a nice gift.  They are probably intended for people that make a lot more money than me and want premium expensive things.

Apple watch is always hard to justify because it's not a necessity by any means.  I used to run a lot and I thought it was great for tracking my runs.  I'll probably get back into that as it is.",others
1577,"I'm down 80lbs since I got my watch. Makes logging and tracking fitness and consumption MINDLESS and yes, WORTH EVERY health savings dollar!!!

SOOOO much health data. I have been able to increase my oxygen consumption and improve my walking stride, gate, and pace. Its fun to know more about yourself. 

I got the watch for fitness and health, but end up using it everyday to automate my house lights, fans, and blinds, the watch vibrate on my wrist in the car when I am using CarPlay for directions, I can control my music when walking using the watch and my AirPods.

&#x200B;

Yes! Worth it! But then again, I got my watch Series 5, brand new, through an Amazon deal and paid using my Health Savings Account. The watch was $200. So yes, definitely worth it. I would never ever ever ever pay $1,300 for a watch that's going to get dinged up. 

But its all subjective and personal. 

But without the watch, I might not have lost 80lbs as consistently as I have, so for me, I probably would have paid $1,300 for that because I have saved SOOOOOO much time and money on health care in the long run.",material
1578,"Received my Apple Watch series 6 as a gift. Have had it for a year now and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd have bought it for myself. It‚Äôs basically a Fitbit on steroids aka activity tracker plus a ton of additional health related products that have no value to me for a much bigger price tag.
For example things like blood oxygen and heart rate tracking aren‚Äôt particularly valuable to me‚Ä¶ I have no idea what my blood oxygen should be or why it‚Äôs important and the app doesn‚Äôt seem to provide much education. The heart rate monitor is unreliable‚Ä¶ it fails to get a clear reading as often as it succeeds so I‚Äôd never feel comfortable relying on it. You can use it to take a picture from your phone‚Ä¶ I do use that on occasion.
Notifications aren‚Äôt all that helpful since voice dictation inevitably has typos, but you can‚Äôt edit them from the watch. Nor can you read the message you dictated before sending so I always end up pulling out my phone to text or to correct whatever I dictated through the watch. Call quality on the watch is patchy.
I like it for running and sometimes I can sync my audible books to the watch and I love not having to take my phone, but out of 3 books I tried to sync only one ever actually downloaded to the watch. Plus it doesn‚Äôt seem to sync with the phone if you do succeed in downloading an audiobook, listen to it on your watch, and then return to the phone you‚Äôll be in a different place than where you left off. 
Couldn‚Äôt say what else it‚Äôs good for since reading anything on it just makes you pull out your phone, you can‚Äôt type on it and the dictation is average at best. I haven‚Äôt tried putting it on my phone plan so can‚Äôt comment if that would improve my experience. Overall it seems like a gimmick product Apple is using to source data for their healthcare projects.

Only to see notifications if you're walking, your phone is not near you and to check time. Especially if you're in highschool and you're only part time it's really not that useful. And it's yet another thing to charge. You forget to charge it? Can't use it. And then if you really don't go out a lot then it's just gonna sit around eventually. My two cents is you could do a lot more with $190 than get a smart watch. If you want it to track fitness you can get a fitness band for way cheaper it also tells you the time, some even notifications. Then you can use the rest of the money on something else you really want. You want to just tell the time? Get a watch. You'll realise as well that you're just gonna reach for your phone anyway when you get a notification and such. A smart watch is a luxury not a necessity.

I also use Siri a lot for reminding me to do stuff, and the silent alarm is insanely useful. Those are some of the things it can also do. If NONE of that seems of any use, just get a regular watch.

My phone isn't always in my pocket, sometimes it is in the bag or in some family member's bag, so then it  is really useful. Also for taking up phone calls. The fitness features are really good. I also track my sleep with the watch, and the app gives me a score on how good my sleep was. 

The heart rate feature is nice to have, but I am young so I don't really look at that much. I don't really use many apps on it, but I would like to have a WhatsApp app or Telegram on it. But WhatsApp app doesn't exist, and Telegram is only on WearOS or WatchOS. The app ecosystem isn't great in Tizen... But you have an Apple Watch, so that's no problem for you. Also, the new health features on the newer watches are really nice, like the SpO2 (blood oxygen) and the new body composition on the Samsung Galaxy Watch4. I have a Xiaomi Smart Scale for the Body Composition, imagine how cool it is to just do that from your wrist! 

So I have told you some negatives and positives, but before I sum it all up, I have to tell you what I paid for it. I paid ‚Ç¨280 (euros), which might be close to 300 dollars, and I bought the Stainless Steel one. The Aluminum ones were much cheaper, around 180 dollars. I'd say that's worth it, if you can find it at that price. But the Apple Watch SE without AOD and ECG sensor is priced around 280 dollars, which is a little overpriced in my opinion.

At the end, if you will really use the health and fitness features and notifications that are built-in, I would say it's worth it, because those are the features most people use. And if you don't use those, then you probably almost won't use it, which makes it not worth it.",others

1. It‚Äôs a watch - time, timers, alarms, date, I forgot what it was like to wear a useful watch.  
2. Fitness - The rings really do motivate me to be more active than I was before.  Now I have to close all the rings and meet the challenges which Has been great during this coronavirus era of staying at home.  
3. Ping my iPhone - It seems silly but instead of asking for someone to call my phone when it‚Äôs somewhere in the house just pinging it has been great.  (It falls between the crack of your car seat, under the couch, etc.)  
4.  Outlook meeting details.  I setup a watch face for work, and the middle is an Oulook complication that tells me when and where the next meeting is.  
5.  World Time - I work with people on the other side of the globe, so another work complication is world time for their time zone.  

Lesser things:  
1. When using AirPods and playing something on your phone, you can use the Digital Crown to adjust the volume.  
2. Easy use of HomeKit - When I‚Äôm exercising I can use it to lock/unlock the door.  
3.  Remote iPhone Camera control - for group photos it‚Äôs nice to see the framing and to trigger the shutter remotely.

Overall, I‚Äôm glad I got the series 3 when I did.  It wasn‚Äôt too much and I‚Äôve gotten a lot out of it.  I‚Äôm considering upgrading to a S7 Cellular to get the extra health items and to be able to stream Apple Music directly without a phone when I workout.",material
1655,"I was feeling the same way when I was about to get mine, and I decided to go for it in the end. IMO, totally worth it. I thought it would only be useful for when I exercise, but it actually motivates you to improve your lifestyle. It reminds you to breathe, to stand for a while when you have been sitting for too long and it is helpful to control your overall health. Being able to answer calls, see your notifications and reply to texts directly from your wrist when you don't have your phone next to you really comes in handy as well. And tbh $190 is a bargain, so I would definitely get it.",material
1656,"I bought my watch in May 2020 and have worn it everyday since so that I could use it for fitness tracking, weight loss, and constant connectivity to my phone. I am down 98lbs and have increased muscle mass because my watch has motivated me to keep up activity streaks. Also, its been super convenint responding to texts using the watch while my phone is in my pocket. I can use the Walkie Talkie feature to talk to Walkie Talkie other watch users from anywhere and its a legit walkie talkie. I like that I can utilize my Reminders and Calendar from my watch without having to take my phone out of my pocket. I can make calls from the watch if I have my hands full and Siri is super helpful with home automations with my lights and blinds, right from my wrist.

The watch has been a life changer for sure for me. So yes, VERY well worth it, especially since I take care of it and have a case and screen protector so that I can have it for a longer period of time, which really stretches out the cost of the watch.

So for High School, if you were super organized like I was, you'd have ALL of your classes and extracurricular activities in your calendar as well as all your social appointments with friends, camping trips, field trips, birthday parties, etc. Test reminders, reminders to study, reminders to read, reminders to go to bed, etc.",material
1657,"Apple Watch is certainly not necessary, and definitely depends on your lifestyle, behavior, habits, etc. 

Mine helps me be more active, as i have a software engineering desk job. The heart applications help me be more mindful with my anxiety. I was worried that I wasn't getting enough physical exercise, so the watch helps me track my progress as I try to improve my own life.

Certainly you can do all of this with a phone, or even less.",material
1658,"It‚Äôs been one of the best gifts I have ever gotten.

Got it on sale and haven‚Äôt regretted it for a moment - I‚Äôm not using it for sleep tracking now because I was getting a little obsessed ‚Ä¶ but it still is keeping me ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù because it tallies every move and encourages you without it feeling like nagging. I read a financial comparison between buying stock in Apple vs spending the same money on equipment over the years ‚Ä¶ the stock payoff is waaay better, but the equipment is more fun. At this price, I think you‚Äôd enjoy it and it may help establish some healthy habits and productivity that will serve you well in the future. You don‚Äôt need it, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it at $190. It also does neat little things like unlock your Mac, use Apple Pay with a wave of the hand, find your iPhone, saves wear and tear on your phone battery, etc",others

1664,The Apple Watch helped me lose 20kilos and start a habit of being active through the ring closing app in activity. I also track fasts and meditations with it. So yes it‚Äôs definitely a super important product in my life if not the most important. If you don‚Äôt really care about the health features however it‚Äôs a pretty pointless product. The notifications on the wrist are nice but not game changing. I hardly use the calculator and the other apps at all.,material

1. You‚Äôre pretty into fitness, and will enjoy having goals to beat, and friends to compete with on the watch.

I didn‚Äôt find it to be worthwhile as an everyday watch. Needs too much attention to charging everyday and wasn‚Äôt sufficiently standalone. Not enough customisation of how I want the screen to display info to serve as a day-long tool.  


I did find it to be good as a sports activity tracker, but then again fairly high priced for that segment of devices.

In the end it felt like wasted money sitting around too much, so I sold it to recoup. I might one day pick up a used GPS-only one for when I‚Äôm biking etc, if I find a cheap one. Would not pay full price at current price Structures as the value was just not there for me.",material

If it wasn't for the pandemic, where faceid for Apple pay is very inconvenient with a mask, I would've not gotten a watch again (I had a series 3; 2 year break from Apple watch, and now I have a series 5). 

It has not changed/saved my life but it made it slightly easier.

Our company is developing a whole ecosystem around Apple Watch and Apple Health so we‚Äôre fully invested.

I honestly don‚Äôt know, I love the watch and it‚Äôve been helping me with staying in shape for a while, it‚Äôs so nice having everything you need on your watch but the price is pretty expensive, then again I can‚Äôt imagine life without it now

Some things I like:

it tells you exactly where and when-to turn when using GPS by buzzing your wrist

Temperature/weather/time/date a lift away

Unlocks your phone automatically when you have a mask on, life saver

‚ÄúHey Siri, call my dad‚Äù ‚Äúhey Siri, show me pictures of watermelons‚Äù ‚Äúhey Siri, set a timer for 22 minutes‚Äù

I kinda like the idea of a strap collection, I could use a collection anyways since I‚Äôve never had one

Notification read and responses in seconds

Fitness tracking and encouragement, I‚Äôve hit 600 calories per day for 12 days straight now, first time in my life 

Those are the big ones but the small ones are still important, all in all I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it",material
1675,"I have a series 5 and I live in NYC, and don‚Äôt have a car so I bike almost everywhere. I really like being able to ask Siri for directions and as I‚Äôm biking either get the taps to tell me if I need to take a turn, or a quick glance to check if I‚Äôm on track. 

I also really like using tap to pay and have pretty much stopped carrying a wallet.

When the series 7 releases I think I‚Äôll upgrade to the cellular model so that I don‚Äôt even need to bring my phone with me :)",others
1676,"It‚Äôs not an essential. And I intend to keep my series 5 for several years rather than on a more frequent upgrade cycle like a phone. 

That said, I use it constantly. It has its own separate uses like activity tracking which is great and valuable but my most constant use is in doing things I‚Äôd otherwise do on my phone‚Ä¶ without my phone. Siri requests, smart home control, timers, making and answering phone calls, responding to messages (and not just iMessage, works with other messaging apps, too), quick calendar checks, step tracking, sleep tracking‚Ä¶ and it tells the time. 

It charges in like an hour or less so you can wear it pretty much 24/7, and I do unless going somewhere where it would look out of place.",material
1677,"I think the Apple Watch is a device that really is in a new niche the way the iPad was when it first came out. It‚Äôs really hard to know in advance if it‚Äôs for you or not. 

A month ago, I was a firm ‚Äúno‚Äù on the Watch. It was cool, but what did I really need it for? 

Three weeks ago, it happened that managed to sell a few items for more cash than I expected and Best Buy was having a major sale on Apple Watches. On a whim, I read up a little again on what the Watch can do and I started to reconsider. I took a few days to think but ultimately decided to pull the trigger and see if the reality of the Watch lived up the usefulness I imagined it could have. 

Two weeks later to today, I feel like I really made the right choice. 

The health features are mostly a novelty to me, but they may see more use as time goes on. 

The big winner for me is all my notifications being mirrored from my phone so I never miss anything. This might not be critical for everyone, but with two young kids this is a lifesaver. Saving a few seconds countless times a day and not needing to fumble my phone out so often really adds up. 

Having selectable little bits of data on the watch face is also saving a lot of time throughout the day. 

Siri/voice dictation on your wrist is more useful than you might imagine. I can have short text exchanges while walking on the street without slowing down to get my phone out and queue commands to the phone without touching the phone. 

Haptic feedback on your wrist makes reminders, alarms and Maps driving directions much less intrusive while at the same time being much more reliable. I don‚Äôt miss turns when my watch taps my wrist but I can keep the audio on my phone off so it doesn‚Äôt bother everybody else in the car.",material
1678,"It has improved my life a lot. Mainly because of its capability to track the calories you burn and your daily activity. The way I see it is that you can't improve what you can't measure. So, the Apple Watch allows me to improve in this aspect. All the other things are handy, having the calendar readily available, keeping track of the last time I fed my cat, no-screen way of getting GPS directions (and hence, a safer driving experience), and its ability to track my sleep quality are all great extras.",material

I prefer the look of the sport band over the sport loop, but it will be easier to get the fit right.",others
1905,"if you're not getting a good fit with the band you have on, try the other end of the band in the box. the holes are offset from each other, and if both sizes of band ends fit, you're never in between holes.

sport loop will give you a perfect fit, but you can try the other band end while you wait to get a sport loop.",material

Yes I think it isn‚Äôt there yet. Perhaps one running a meant-to-be-stand-alone OS (like a skinned Android) with a Bluetooth mini QWERTY keyboard would the issues I‚Äôve highlighted. Sort of like a tiny blackberry with a wrist strap. At that point though I would glue one to the other and make a mini BB. But then you could just get a Jellyphone 2 at that point. 

One other consideration that popped up for me a few times is that it‚Äôs your phone on your wrist. If you are going to a formal event, it really stands out and makes you look like a SpyKid. I think most smartwatches will, the displays look too 2D to fool anyone that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äòreal‚Äô watch (even with Always-On). I guess you could take off the straps and keep it in your pocket, but its so little and slippery it will end up flying into someone‚Äôs wine.",others

2. Don‚Äôt need the blood monitoring thingy

About the chipset, S5 is still going to be updated for years and I'm sure it'll perform like a champ for the next 3 years. U1 chip might be the thing that I'd like most to have, but I'm using an iPhone XS without the U1 too, so I can live without that.",others

Sure, you can buy a new 42mm Series 3 for $200 or less.

I carry my phone where ever I go. There are sensors that interest me, and I would be interested in wearing it when I sleep (I used to have a jawbone, but the strap broke twice, and the company gave up and left the market). 

I would have liked a longer battery life, which a processor produced on a smaller node would have helped achieve.

I have checked the size of the S6 watch in the apple store, and I know I need at least a 7‚Äù watch strap, so either the 41mm or 45mm S7 would be OK for me, just a matter of whether I would prefer the larger screen. 

It sometimes takes me a while to make a decision, especially when there is significant costs involved. For a watch, its pretty expensive, though my Citizen eco watch costs about ¬£250, so I am not adverse to spending that type of money on a watch. 

The only reason I am hesitant, is if the processor is the same as the S6, and knowing that Apple is moving towards a smaller node for it processors, which could potentially produce a more efficient processor, I am wondering whether waiting for the S8 would be better if it hopefully has longer batter life.

> Battery life has been fantastic when raise to wake is disabled...

> While it works 95% of the time I want it to work, it also lights up the screen when I don't want to, especially while running. 

Always on display is a requirement for me. I want to see something there always. I just need the watch to get me through the day, and, for me, charging while I eat breakfast and shower (times I am not active anyway) and an hour before bed (again, times that I am winding down) is more than good enough. I always go to bed with 100% charge, and have plenty left at the end of even a 2 hour workout.

I couldn't stand it when I had the S2 and went for a run and couldn't see the data on the screen - raise to wake worked only sometimes, and I'd have to exaggerate the motion or tap the display to see stats. AOD is so much better IMO. I won't get another watch without it (unless Apple stops making them with AOD - unlikely).

> Apple Health syncs everything between all the health related apps, but it does not seem to detect duplicates. While you can disable write permissions for one of both apps, it would be nice if duplicates were detected and removed.

For my indoor cycling workouts (just as an example), I have a cycling computer that syncs with an app on my iPhone (and Apple Health) at the same time the cycling workout from the watch syncs. However, I do not get duplication in total exercise time or any of the rings. (I keep both because the workouts app doesn't capture cadence or distance for indoor workouts while the Wahoo app can report that.)

> Limited storage capacity. With only four 3rd party apps installed, my watch won't install WatchOS updates complaining there's too little storage space. Having to unpair your watch, update and restore from a backup gets old very quickly.

That's really only an issue for older S3 older watches, FWIW. I understand that it sucks if you have an older S3 with a small amount of storage, but the newer watches have plenty more storage and no issues with updating.

> The activity goals are the same for every day, and they're always absolute and not relative. 

I'd also love to see smarter goals, and a recognition of easy days and rest days, and even injuries and injury recovery, with recover plans, etc. However, I think the ring motivation is meant for people who are new to Apple Watch and have not exercised regularly in the past, to try to get them to make daily exercise and movement a habit. I respect that and frankly I don't really care if I don't meet the move goal - I have a workout schedule and don't really need the watch to motivate me to get it done.

Well, my previous Forerunner instead often just showed my heart rate at ""sitting"" rate when I was trying to run at a decent speed (I am not an experienced runner), so I guess a wrong heart is more annoying than no measurement.

Yes, same. I'd happily pay a premium for that, too. 

Something between the apple watch and the woop band. You know, the hardware of the apple watch but with things like the recovery score for woop (if you are familiar). Just something that aggregates some kind of score based the exercise you've done over the last week and your rest/sleep.

And of course 'rest days' would be good for the AW. I'm currently training for Audax cycling, so I might do 250km in one go then nothing for 2 days. Doesn't really seem fair that I'll have done 7,000kcal+ on a Saturday and then not reach my move goal on a Sunday or Monday and then be made to feel guilty (or worse, feel like I'm overtraining by doing anything on those rest days). 

On the sleep schedule you can customise every day, the move/exercise/stand being along the same lines would be a big change.",material

Garmin body battery is underrated. I look at it regularly, and I don't think Apple has anything like that. It has to be worth a few points.

With regards to the GPS.  I have also read that the GPS tracking isn't that great.  Maybe because I'm not an elite athlete, but for me, what is more important, is consistency.

I do think it depends on where you (which satellites networks are available) and what kind of access the watch has to the sky (buildings, trees etc).

It also depends what you are using GPS for. Most of the YouTube videos I‚Äôve see focus on comparing the GPS tracks between the watches and the distance recorded at the end of the activity.

[It is. Ben Bajarin who got a review unit confirmed it](https://techpinions.com/my-first-week-with-the-apple-watch/39543)

>Apple Watch also notifies you via different sounds and through vibration using the Taptic Engine. Each type of notification has a different feel. Once you learn these taptic patterns, it helps you know the type of notification before you even look at it. A good example of this was the Maps experience. When walking down the street to a meeting in San Francisco, I used the Watch to guide me there. The Apple Watch has a different taptic pattern for going left and for going right. This way, I didn‚Äôt need to lift my wrist to look at the display to know which way to go. The implications of these different types of notifications based on feel are unexplored territory.

2609,Apple Store employee told me the feature is still there when I was at my appointment yesterday. ,material
2610,I think it's fascinating. Like having spidey senses that doesn't involve you looking or listening to something to get a notification. It could have very interesting applications. ,material

(More seriously, there was a walkie talkie function that was supposed to be part of the ""new ways to connect"" part of the watch. With the release of the watch it disappeared.)",material
2619,"I had a Moto 360 and it was most useful during driving, and its vibration patterns didn't even distinguish between left and right turns.

Example: I was driving to my girlfriend one weekend, about a 30 minute drive. I encountered some major and unexpected construction that basically completely diverted me and I no longer knew how to get there. I didn't even have to pull over or anything though. I just told my watch to navigate me, and then texted her that I'd be late, again by speaking to the watch, all without looking at it.",material

2895,">So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way

Its not the app on the watch controling your car.. that is not possible because everything needs to go through tesla servers and be verified with tokens etc. Basically what the app does is imitate the original tesla app by issuing the same commands and using its token. If it is open source and it can be seen that the tokens are stored on your device not on some db hosted with the developer then it is safe as it works exactly like the original. But as you said those token gives access to your car and anyone sharing them needs to be cautious about it.",material

That's what I like about open source code, you can check it yourself and if that is not enough, compile your own version (which is what I do, but not out of fear, but so I have access right away to the features I add).

On my Garmin, when it needs to connect, it asks for my username password on my phone (through the Garmin app) and that is used to generate the token.",material

First is to make the requests directly to Teslas servers from an application, second would be to set up a self-hosted server that facilitates interaction with Tesla‚Äôs servers and no third party. 

Either way you‚Äôre typing your credentials into an ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù app, they‚Äôre just never going anywhere but to either yourself, or Tesla.

I haven‚Äôt looked into how Tesla handles authentication, but I doubt they have an Oauth system.",material
2900,"I'm not suggesting it can be ""stolen"" because it doesn't need to be, it's already been given freely to the app.

Once you have the token, the app can harvest data it wants, and can send whatever command it wants. The developer can do anything the token has access to do.",material
2901,"Yes, that's why I mentioned in a different thread that open source is a great way to prevent that. The Tesla app on my Garmin watch has its source on GitHub so you can see what it does and if you're very paranoid, you can compile your own copy (like I do but not for that reason but to have the features I added right away and not wait for the updated app to appear on the store).

Your concerns apply to anything you install on your watch, phone, computer, etc. that does not come from your service suppliers.",material
2902,"Yes I agree, that's why I don't log my accounts into third parties.",material

It's open source and runs interpreted so no compiled code. Much harder to sneak harmful code. Through Linux firewall, you can restrict access to just Tesla's server being queried so almost impossible to steal the token.

On the one hand this isn't such a bad thing since it does the sharpening really well, but on the other hand I don't think it always looks true to life as a result. 

The real problem I see with the Xs and moreso the X is the method of noise reduction Apple applies in their processing. It tends to muddy up details. From what I've seen this is significantly better on the Xs, but still could use some work.

But here's the real question. If we're focusing on the issue of fine detail can we objectively say which one is better? As a Google branded phone user I've always been in the camp of the more detail the better under all circumstances. However, with the introduction of the Xs I'm really not so sure anymore.

People who work in slaughterhouses often retire with PTSD from having to kill so many animals. Many that stay, if you look at slaughterhouse footage and footage from the leather industry, are undeniably psychopathic animal abusers. They don‚Äôt care.

There is no good angle how you can document skinning animals alive, but you can just lie about the fact that animal was alive and cause investigation.

Objects don‚Äôt have feelings and don‚Äôt have rights.
Animal rights and regulations regarding their welfare exist exactly because people don‚Äôt want to treat animals like objects. These are constantly improving as well, the more we learn about animal behavior and physiology.

For the same reason ‚Äúfree range‚Äù farms exist as well, where animals are not locked up in tight cages.

I myself new right from the start that I would never use the Blood Oxygen or the ECG feature, and I realized the Always On Display didn‚Äôt matter to me at all because I mostly wear long sleeves and if I really wanted to glance at the time, I could just turn the digital crown a bit.

I‚Äôd say go for the SE to try it out, and if it really suits you, just hang on to the SE for some time (it‚Äôs such a good watch still a year after release) and upgrade to a new watch when there are actually significant updates or new features that you will **actually** use or utilize to its potential.

**TLDR: I‚Äôd recommend the SE, most of the features in the 7 will probably not be taken advantaged for for a 14 year old (ECG, Blood Oxygen can‚Äôt be used). Unless you really want the always on display or the faster charging, then I wouldn‚Äôt. SE has really served me well, no regrets getting it over the 7.

3267,"Oh, that‚Äôs a shame, thank you though.",material
3268,"Money isn‚Äôt really an issue for me and yeah, I think the main thing I‚Äôm considering at the moment is the always on display. Thanks for the help.",material
3269,Oh right sorry and thanks for the info.,material
3270,"Yes that is true, I think right now I‚Äôm focused on how important I find those factors as there aren‚Äôt too many reasons to go for 7.",material
3271,"I see, thanks for the help!",material
3272,[deleted],others
3273,That‚Äôs quite true and I probably won‚Äôt be needing it. I guess the main factors I‚Äôm concerned about are the screen size and always on mode.,material
3274,"Ah okay, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll be thinking about, thanks.",material
3275,[deleted],others
3276,"No worries, you‚Äôre welcome üëç",material
3277,Also the 7 has a slightly better chip. May not seem like much but I imagine future OS updates in the years down from now it would help. It also has U1 which SE doesn‚Äôt have. All may seem minor but just some specs to consider about.,material
3278,"Actually, you get a bunch of exclusive Nike watch faces as well that are not available to be downloaded elsewhere.",material
3279,"I guess different folks will feel differently about that. I know the 7 has more screen but using the se it doesn‚Äôt feel dated or that the screen is small for me. The idea of always on mode is nice n all but I don‚Äôt know why I would need my watch screen on when I‚Äôm not looking at it, the rise to look thing on the se when I tilt my wrist works really well and brings the screen on. If I had the 7 I think I would disable aod. We all have different use cases though so that might be very different to yours.",material
3280,No problem. Generally speaking every Apple Watch is good for 3 years before really big new features are added (I‚Äôve owned them since Series 0). Series 6 is from 2020 so you‚Äôre good till about Series 9 in 2023. Series 6 has exactly the same internals as a Series 7 minus fast charging.,material
3281,"There seems to be. I visited the website u/DIL3MMA mentioned and Target will roll out a deal for the SE in both sizes, the 40mm being $219. Big shoutout my guy, thanks!

I was unsure but I can‚Äôt really justify $180 more for the s7 as I‚Äôm really just using this as a workout device and notification checker.",material
3282,"That‚Äôs a good point, thanks.",material
3283,And you get to choose the Nike bands at first purchase which I think are better (especially the sport loop),material
3284,The S7 screen is nice but it definitely hasn‚Äôt made the S4-S6/SE design/screens feel immediately dated the way the S4 did to the S0-S3.,material
3285,"Yeah, I guess I can see always on being irritating so I think I‚Äôll do a bit more research on that. Thanks for sharing.",material

3287,"How long until a slightly modified version is released as the OnePlus Watch?

If this would run the 4100 platform, it would be an instant buy for me. At 249‚Ç¨, I'll just wait for the first 4100 watches. The next Fossil most likely won't have it, but they might a revision later on that has 4100.",material
3288,so OEMs are allowed to skin Wear OS now?,material
3289,"Indeed, 1GB of RAM or GTFO.

Typed that while looking disappointingly at my Fossil Sport.",material
3290,Can't wait for this to finally be available. Also can't help but wonder if the 3100 variation will run similarly and with close to the same battery life. Props to Mr Mobile for getting this review out quickly.,material
3291,god I love Mr mobile,material
3292,Really curious about the price,material
3293,"WearOS on a square screen is where it's at. Man I wish it weren't such an Apple copycat though.

I'm curious about the battery life though. That's unusually bad for that size of battery. Wonder if Oppo's ""optimizations"" fucked something up?",material
3294,"I was waiting for the Mi Watch, but since it seems like it's not coming west I might give this one a chance ü§î",material
3295,I have it!! Its pretty and durable and swimproof. It has a lot of watchfaces and its battery is 36 hours without battery saver. But due to chinese color os version it has a lot of chinese apps and no playstore. It has sleep tracking though and i have notifications of all my apps and i inserted my cards at its wallet succesfully. It has esim but doesnt work in europe,material
3296,Sold.,material
3297,"As a fan of square watches, I am very pleased. WearOS hasn't had a new one in a while.",material
3298,Zero information about fitness features...,others
3299,"18 hours later on almost a 4 year old watch

[Frontier](https://i.imgur.com/gACE8Gs.jpg)",material
3300,i honestly really likes it. unfortunately Wear OS is still so dead with app support,material
3301,"Even though I am an Apple Watch user, its really good to see finally a worthy competitor from the Android (Wear OS) space. I am only concerned about its battery life because my Apple Watch easily gets through a day and still has around 40-45% charge left. If Oppo watch is able to get through a day easily, then I feel it‚Äôs a total bang for buck. I would easily recommend it to a lot of my friends who are on Android.",material
3302,Now we need a similar one plus watch with some oxygen OS flavour and Snapdragon 4100+,material
3303,Asus Zenwatch says hi,material
3304,I'm in the US. Do I just have to wait for it to pop up on eBay or something?,material
3305,"Man, that's a pretty nice watch!!",material
3306,With Sleep tracking!,material
3307,I love the look of my gen 5,material
3308,"As an Apple Watch user who is planning to switch, I don‚Äôt think I can get much better than the Oppo Watch. Just have to wait for a US release...",material
3309,I prefer the look of stock wear os to be honest wish this had a rotating crown and get rid of those stupid curves on the screen.,material
3310,"I'd be in on it if the battery life was better.  


  
Love the square look.",energy
3311,"The second I can import it from India on eBay, AliExpress, or Amazon I am going to get it. I now have a reason to get a smart watch.",material
3312,Neat.,material
3313,Droppus - thx. Have u seen any visual side by side? Maybe its just too soon.,material
3314,I really wish there was bigger selection of square watches. I think this one is the only one?,material
3315,Oppo new watch 46mm or Gen 5 fossil which is best?,material
3316,Ew. Gross.,material
3317,"Sam - can u take a photo of the oppo, apple and what ever that round watch you showed at the end of the video? The 46mm seems like it might be too big for my arm. Thx. O and nice video.",material
3318,[removed],others
3319,I'm looking for a replacement just frustrated that it won't be released until October in the UK,material
3320,Michael talks about in the video how its really more about getting 1gb+ of RAM rather than a new chipset. An extra co-processor and smaller chip fab won't help you much if you still only have 512mb or 756mb of RAM.,material
