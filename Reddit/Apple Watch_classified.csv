1) They're still super close to Silver and Space Grey. A hint of gold or blue does not make them ""not neutral,"" and anybody who isn't up on Apple color conventions is still going to look at them and think they look silver or dark grey. 

2) Why does it matter if they're neutral in the first place? You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. No, the Space Black Ti model is not going to look more professional/less gadgety than the Midnight Al.",others

The screen going so far edge to edge with such a curvy bit of glass looks weird

Looks to me like the screen is too big for the watch. The way the reflective edge obscures the display just doesn’t look all that great

The answer to the question ""Why isn't x color more popular"" when it comes to fashion accessories is pretty simple.

A few tips: it's a little tricky at first but just watch a youtube video on how to do it, and tape over the rest of the watch in case you put too much glue.

Fair enough! Worth mentioning that one of these options is used though and probably won't come with the same warranty and might not be in the same condition or have the same battery health.

Also not sure what that has to do with if the Series 7 is worth it or not.

I mean they were pretty clear that the extra room for text was the result of the UI being redesigned, not *just* because the screen is larger. They had a whole section of the presentation dedicated to that UI redesign.

I also kind of doubt that the reason they didn't cram more text in before was simply to sell us on a larger screen 3 years later.

Seriously, I would like to have the Apple Watch capabilities for the price, on a watch that runs Android Wear so it's compatible with my Nexus 6:

* It has a full metal body (the Moto360 cracks on the back)
* Has a speaker, okay, speakerphone sometimes is useful, but being able to hear the notifications is important too
* It can do mobile payments
* Contrary to what he said, it's an OLED screen, and it has more DPI than any Android watch, which is strange, coming from Apple
* The heart rate sensor really works, most AnW watches have poor sensors with too small areas that get cought in hair. 

And even the price, for Apple, for the quality (I had one sport in hand), the features, and the fact that's 8GB, it's not even bad...

He barely covers force touch, barely covers water resistance, the fitness apps, heart rate monitor and digital touch. Having an opinion on the watch is fine, but for a video review I thought it was sorely lacking content. He also deals with the price as if it is a static.

They might have the same pack shape for manufacturing simplicity but there's no way it's sitting on that much extra range without being paid for. The upgrades are full self driving and a soft lock on some 0-60 performance for the AWD non performance models. That software lock does NOT get it all the way up to the performance model, it only unlocks residual performance from the motors. The rear motor is >200hp on its own (though the torque is software restricted at low speed to avoid torque ripple effects), but adding the (more powerful, no ripple effects) front motor only brings it up to about 350hp. The $2k power bump unlocks the missing chunk given the limitations of the long range model as is, and the actual Performance model has some additional stuff (though the motors are, at their core, the same) to provide the last bit of performance, my guess would be some improved materials to keep up reliability with all the extra torque.

There was one point in time where the model S was selling 70kwh models that actually had 80kwh batteries, but that was for two reasons: They'd stopped making the 70kwh battery pack, and restricting the 80kwh battery to 70kwh usable actually improved usable life (and it wasn't NEARLY as big a jump as the current model 3 standard->long range models).

Also, visual comparisons between transreflective and OLED screens say otherwise against your statement that ""they look just as good"". You were probably right if you compared a transreflective display against one of the first smartwatches in the market with incredibly dim and poorly color accurate LCD and TFT displays (looking at you LG Watch first Gen, and first Gen Sony Smartwatch), but modern smartwatches have gotten crazy bright and good. And transreflective displays simply can't hold a candle to them. Just take a look at this comparison of Garmin watches using OLED and transreflective displays

The transreflective one makes blacks look like grays, and colors look dull and flat. Giving it a near sticker like appearance.

The more corroded it gets, the slower it corrodes further (unlike steel which just corrodes constantly, aluminium corrosion is a protective layer).

Based on the fact that this technology is not the industry standard (which is already fairly unreliable), and that Apple themselves have strictly stated that their watches *should not be used for medical purposes* (essentially opting out of any claim that they actually work), I’m comfortable assuming that it’s all marketing nonsense.

The apple watch sends you constant reminders, incentives and encouragement to close your ring, beat your target, and overall be more active. On top of that they also allow you to share this data with friends, so you compete to see who gets more points.

This is simple, but Apple did the difficult part. They perfected the balance between annoying and useful and made very smart decisions on which information to present. Active calories for example is a great ideal instead of total, or exercise only, because its abstract enough to cover everyday things like going up stairs but also skews towards exercise.

Then there are nice behind the scenes things. For example, the apple watch easily syncs with myfitnesspal so I can track my calorie goals and activity in the same place. The health app connects with my Withings scale, so it tracks my weight and body composition.

I'm extremely critical of the Apple Watch because it looks like trash, battery life is way too short (gotta charge it every day), and performance is meh. But I keep coming back to it. Before I used a fitbit, microsoft band, Nokia/Withings HR Steel, and Samsung Galaxy Active, they all have pros and cons, but the apple watch nails the most aspects. Too bad it's ugly as sin.",others

Pardon me, u/TeslaRanger, for not having peer reviewed sources for every bit of knowledge I’ve picked up in my ~20 years in EMS...

My proof is in my practice. Thousands of patient interactions throughout my decades of experience—anecdotal as it may be—have led me to be highly skeptical of pulse oximetry readings from any device, let alone a watch.

Pulse oximetry most accurately measures capillary blood flow, which isn’t done reliably in the wrist.

Since the devices nurses/doctors/paramedics use in the hospital/prehospital setting aren’t widely regarded as accurate, I cringe to see the people relying on a consumer product for any reliability.

Also, there is this thing called false advertising... 

Apple has been very wary about adding these sensors and health monitoring features; the original Apple Watch had more sensors than they enabled because they were not happy with the accuracy of the ones they did not enable yet.

Also, Apple works with the medical research community on medical studies using the AW etc, there’s an iPhone app to find them/sign up.  I doubt the medical community would be using tech that did not work in studies.

Apple Watch medical sensors or related have repeatedly saved people’s lives, too. Easily searchable.

578,"1. Conventional pulse oximeters work by passing two different light beams through a translucent body part like a finger. It’s not capillary action so much as how much light is absorbed by each of the two beams as it passes through. The absorption depends heavily on the amount of oxygen in the blood. 

https://www.howequipmentworks.com/pulse_oximeter/

2. Watch based oximeters wouldn’t act in the same way because there’s no detector on the other side of the wrist, so it might be a new technology. It would be difficult to compare the two oximeter types until the wrist kind is more mature. 

3. Apple specifically denotes not to use the O2 sensor for medical diagnosis, and the feature is only for “wellness” purposes, which could be open to personal interpretation.

4. Using “years of experience” when one doesn’t fully understand the science doesn’t really constitute a good defense. This is especially true because 1) new technology is made available throughout that time, 2) technology matures and becomes more reliable, and 3) previous modes of thought have to be replaced with new modes of thought as new information becomes available.

1. People who use the phones too much: settle your notification/checking/internet anxiety by having a little electronic thing on your wrist that removes your excuse to look at your phone.

2. People who want to carry less: w/Apple pay I can buy food/groceries/snacks/shop without my phone, like on a run, hike or if I leave my phone in the car. I have access to my calendar at all times. If you get the cell version, you can leave your phone at home for the day.

3. People who hate taking their phone out for little things (short texts, check weather, read texts, cooking timers etc): it is so convenient to text with no phone..unless you text a lot, then it can be annoying. 

The watch has 4 key functions IMO: workout tracking, texting/phone call via Siri, Apple pay, weather, timers/reminders. Those 4 things make it really nice to have. Unlike a phone, you have to have it on you at all times to really get used to it.

Bought the S0 on release day and gave it back to Apple.

Tried again with a S3 LTE on release day as well.
It was pretty nice. I could go to the gym without my phone, just the watch and AirPods. The issue was battery and speed. So often it would hang, so often the battery wouldn’t allow me my full routine at the gym. But it was still pretty nice.

I’ve enjoyed it for one year, then as soon as I stopped going to the gym, I had zero use for it.

So in my case, totally worth it and one of the best Apple products I have owned.",battery
666,"It depends on what you do and if you can afford it. I only have a gps series 4 but that doesn’t matter because i have my phone on me no matter what.

It is very useful when navigating in a city where using a phone can be distracting and cumbersome. You won’t miss a notification ever or any phone call with it on. Very customizable, and helps get active and is health oriented.

If you can afford it and are in the apple ecosystem then it is pretty good. But just remember that you are pretty much locked in apples system if you get it.

Also get applecare if u get one, won’t need to worry about a bulky ugly case or screen protectors. Unless you are in environments where it could easily crack on something and get damaged, then i guess a shock proof case will be in order if you don’t want to use up your 2 accidental damage incidents.

Go to an apple store and check it out if you are serious.

Don’t get a series 3 though.",others

I got it to track my swimming workout, and splurged on the LTE version because the ability to take calls without my phone would potentially be helpful. I haven't really used that very much, but it's nice to have.

What I actually wind up using it for is to check the weather and set timers, and I seem to do those multiple times per day and it's very convenient for that. I also get my text notifications on it. All of these save me pulling out my phone. I still  carry my phone, but with a toddler it's nice to be able to do things virtually  hands-free.",others

I’m an interesting case in that I don’t do any formal exercise at all. I do track my steps and make a general attempt to close my “rings”, and the data for steps/calories is definitely more accurate than just the phone. 

It is indeed nice to have notifications on my wrist and recently I’ve been using Apple Pay on my Watch very frequently (almost every day).  

One thing I’ve only begun to use is raise to speak to Siri, and it’s surprisingly useful not to have to shout “Hey Siri”  and your can do it when your phone is in your pocket.

I’m trying to get into shape again but my heart isn’t in the best shape and the other day said my heartbeat was irregular. I checked on my omron blood pressure monitor to verify and my diastolic and systolic numbers were high. I had to take a pill to get them back to normal.

I'm sure there are other options but I do like the Apple watch and I like how it works with my other Apple products, for example managing my playlist while I run.

705,"It boils down to three things for me

1. As you mentioned, fitness tracking is great. Especially when you can bring your music with you without the phone. Even without the cell connection, you can store a reasonably sized playlist on the watch
2. Wallet. I never really used Apple Pay that much in brick & mortar stores before getting an Apple Watch. For me, pulling out my phone is as much 'work' as my physical wallet. But with my Apple Watch, it's already out and just requires a double press. In the NYC subway, I don't even need to press (if I change the setting) to simply pay for my subway ride by passing by. And though it's superfluous, getting on a plane by scanning your watch is baller.
3. Siri/Message responses. Because the way you use Siri on the watch means you bring the equipment closer to your mouth, it seems to be better at parsing what you're saying. I mostly use it to respond to messages or set reminders, but it really makes me appreciate Siri a ton more. I also use it to verbally turn on lights. It really boils down to Siri understanding me better and therefore being more useful

Generally, I would say none of this is necessary, but once you have it, it's a sweet device that becomes very annoying to live without. There are definitely other features I use and care about (eg, the ability to see my cal, the time, and the temp at a glance), but they aren't game changers for me like the above. It really makes the ecosystem shine. Hope this helps",others

Every time I consider a Watch I wonder to myself whether I *really* need or want faster access to notifications etc. I could probably stand to be less connected to my phone, not more. 

Also perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I more often than not find that people with an Apple Watch make a lot of professional faux pas in meetings and the like. I consider every time someone opposite me has (rudely) looked at their watch for some useless notification and realize I don’t want to be that person.

780,"It's useful if you find your sleeping isn't always great and you want to know why. It may be useful to see the affect of stress, alcohol, etc. on your sleep - you might never know otherwise - and can help you make changes if you don't like what you're seeing and you can correlate the data to how you feel.

An example: I often fall asleep with my airpods in, listening to a podcast. But when I wake up in the morning, I notice my airpods are almost always placed on my bedside table. I rarely remember taking them out. Autosleep shows that I typically do this out an hour or so into my sleep. But that's a problem - when I'm not wearing airpods I hit deep sleep about an hour in. So sleeping with airpods, I've found, can sort of waste the first hour of my sleep. So I try not to fall asleep with my airpods in.

It's not essential. It's not a game-changer. Like all aspects of the watch, I feel, it just helps a little bit. And that's fine by me.

Edit: another example. The CLEAR difference in Autosleep's data between drinking and not drinking, especially wine, gave me reason to give up drinking pretty much all together. It explained why I was so fatigued for days despite not having a hangover. So that's pretty great.

I'm not surprised Apple is working on their own sleep tracker, though. I think Autosleep's calibration sucks - the data isn't super accurate. But it's better than anything else I've used.",others

I understand it is a viable complaint but they should know that there will be a learning curve to learn any new device. 

I also understand that the Apple Watch should seamlessly integrate into our lives, but with any new product it will take some learning and adapting to a new OS.",others
783,"Some of those issues also had nothing to do with the watch itself, like plugging the charger wrong into the wall, which was just a mistake on their part. Overall I don't this review is a very accurate account of the watch experience. ",others
784,"People have such short memories. The reason the iPad didn't receive this criticism was because it's OS was nearly identical to the iPhone's. Now, when Apple actually innovates to bring a fresh OS to market, these so called ""tech"" journalists can't seem to appreciate that and are calling the software's fresh workflow a detriment to the device. 


Not only that, but if you think back to the first iPhone, when it initially released no one knew how to use it. It was only once you began to see it in the wild, observing people using it and seeing Apple's marketing ads at play that by the time you actually picked one up for yourself, you figured it out.",others
785,Though I suppose it doesn't really hurt making note of ALL their trouble they have despite it being caused by the watch or by human error. It is kind of obnoxious to do so though.,others
786,"Exactly, I just find these reviews that state that the OS is so overwhelming and after learning it it becomes a breeze, well obviously.

It would be better if they didn't have such a negative reaction to it for something we have all have to go through when learning a new OS. ",others
787,"That might be a small concern for me, speed, I had a pebble and I am used to the slow loading times due to the pebble trying to pull information from my phone, I am sure they will speed it up in updates. 

It is initial launch, there are bound to be bugs and optimization opportunities. 

I don't really have any other reservations about the watch, I am set on purchasing it, there isn't really anything that has me on the fence. ",others

With my pebble I don't ever have the issue of not seeing the time when I raise my arm, but with the apple watch it may not work every time. First world problem that will get fixed I know, but that's my only real complaint from these reviews. I still plan to get one.",others
789,"Obviously, they are more likely to mention their short comings in a review, but the wording and the tone when talking about how difficult the learning curve is shouldn't be so negative-- well yes, it is going to be a steep curve because it is a new type of OS that very few has had time to use, it is good that Apple developed an entirely new type of environment on a 1 inch display that is integrated with the iPhone.

Sport loop for sure. The velcro closure makes it much more adjustable. The solo loop and braided loop are basically sized the same way as the sport band, so you'd have to choose the smaller size. I think that they're a little more forgivable fitting than the sport band, but you still may get annoyed by how tight it is.

However, it is a personal matter. On TikTok there are many reels of people claiming to have wasted money leaving the AW unloaded in a drawer. This is not my case. The watch made me want to run and train and I have never stopped since. The function of the rings works on my person, despite being a person who has always been fit, I used to have that extra kilos that I can now keep under control and do good for my health. 

Another point is that it is definitely a nice item, so it is also very nice to wear for everyday life or an elegant dinner. Best money spent in my life honestly.

And it's yet another thing to charge. You forget to charge it? Can't use it. And then if you really don't go out a lot then it's just gonna sit around eventually. My two cents is you could do a lot more with $190 than get a smart watch. If you want it to track fitness you can get a fitness band for way cheaper it also tells you the time, some even notifications. Then you can use the rest of the money on something else you really want. You want to just tell the time? Get a watch. You'll realise as well that you're just gonna reach for your phone anyway when you get a notification and such. A smart watch is a luxury not a necessity.

I also use reminders on it religiously as a to do list.

891,Likely different for me as I'm much older. It encouraged me to get out and about and as a result I lost some weight.

892,"I’ve had mine for 2.5 years now.  What I like about it:
1. It’s a watch - time, timers, alarms, date, I forgot what it was like to wear a useful watch.  
2. Fitness - The rings really do motivate me to be more active than I was before.  Now I have to close all the rings and meet the challenges which Has been great during this coronavirus era of staying at home.  
3. Ping my iPhone - It seems silly but instead of asking for someone to call my phone when it’s somewhere in the house just pinging it has been great.  (It falls between the crack of your car seat, under the couch, etc.)  
4.  Outlook meeting details.  I setup a watch face for work, and the middle is an Oulook complication that tells me when and where the next meeting is.  
5.  World Time - I work with people on the other side of the globe, so another work complication is world time for their time zone.  

Lesser things:  
1. When using AirPods and playing something on your phone, you can use the Digital Crown to adjust the volume.  
2. Easy use of HomeKit - When I’m exercising I can use it to lock/unlock the door.  
3.  Remote iPhone Camera control - for group photos it’s nice to see the framing and to trigger the shutter remotely.

Overall, I’m glad I got the series 3 when I did.  It wasn’t too much and I’ve gotten a lot out of it.  I’m considering upgrading to a S7 Cellular to get the extra health items and to be able to stream Apple Music directly without a phone when I workout.",watch face
893,"Apple Watch is certainly not necessary, and definitely depends on your lifestyle, behavior, habits, etc. 

Mine helps me be more active, as i have a software engineering desk job. The heart applications help me be more mindful with my anxiety. I was worried that I wasn't getting enough physical exercise, so the watch helps me track my progress as I try to improve my own life.

Certainly you can do all of this with a phone, or even less.",others
894,"I had the SE (4G+GPS) for about 5 months then sold it.   


I didn’t find it to be worthwhile as an everyday watch. Needs too much attention to charging everyday and wasn’t sufficiently standalone. Not enough customisation of how I want the screen to display info to serve as a day-long tool.  


I did find it to be good as a sports activity tracker, but then again fairly high priced for that segment of devices.

In the end it felt like wasted money sitting around too much, so I sold it to recoup. I might one day pick up a used GPS-only one for when I’m biking etc, if I find a cheap one. Would not pay full price at current price Structures as the value was just not there for me.",others

If it wasn't for the pandemic, where faceid for Apple pay is very inconvenient with a mask, I would've not gotten a watch again (I had a series 3; 2 year break from Apple watch, and now I have a series 5). 

It has not changed/saved my life but it made it slightly easier.

I also really like using tap to pay and have pretty much stopped carrying a wallet.

897,"It’s not an essential. And I intend to keep my series 5 for several years rather than on a more frequent upgrade cycle like a phone. 

That said, I use it constantly. It has its own separate uses like activity tracking which is great and valuable but my most constant use is in doing things I’d otherwise do on my phone… without my phone. Siri requests, smart home control, timers, making and answering phone calls, responding to messages (and not just iMessage, works with other messaging apps, too), quick calendar checks, step tracking, sleep tracking… and it tells the time. 

It charges in like an hour or less so you can wear it pretty much 24/7, and I do unless going somewhere where it would look out of place.",others
898,"I think the Apple Watch is a device that really is in a new niche the way the iPad was when it first came out. It’s really hard to know in advance if it’s for you or not. 

A month ago, I was a firm “no” on the Watch. It was cool, but what did I really need it for? 

Three weeks ago, it happened that managed to sell a few items for more cash than I expected and Best Buy was having a major sale on Apple Watches. On a whim, I read up a little again on what the Watch can do and I started to reconsider. I took a few days to think but ultimately decided to pull the trigger and see if the reality of the Watch lived up the usefulness I imagined it could have. 

Two weeks later to today, I feel like I really made the right choice. 

The health features are mostly a novelty to me, but they may see more use as time goes on. 

The big winner for me is all my notifications being mirrored from my phone so I never miss anything. This might not be critical for everyone, but with two young kids this is a lifesaver. Saving a few seconds countless times a day and not needing to fumble my phone out so often really adds up. 

Having selectable little bits of data on the watch face is also saving a lot of time throughout the day. 

Siri/voice dictation on your wrist is more useful than you might imagine. I can have short text exchanges while walking on the street without slowing down to get my phone out and queue commands to the phone without touching the phone. 

Haptic feedback on your wrist makes reminders, alarms and Maps driving directions much less intrusive while at the same time being much more reliable. I don’t miss turns when my watch taps my wrist but I can keep the audio on my phone off so it doesn’t bother everybody else in the car.",watch face
899,"It has improved my life a lot. Mainly because of its capability to track the calories you burn and your daily activity. The way I see it is that you can't improve what you can't measure. So, the Apple Watch allows me to improve in this aspect. All the other things are handy, having the calendar readily available, keeping track of the last time I fed my cat, no-screen way of getting GPS directions (and hence, a safer driving experience), and its ability to track my sleep quality are all great extras.",others

GPS is a major Garmin weakness IMO. I had to get a Stryd pod to fix it. That is totally unacceptable.

Garmin body battery is underrated. I look at it regularly, and I don't think Apple has anything like that. It has to be worth a few points.

I do think it depends on where you (which satellites networks are available) and what kind of access the watch has to the sky (buildings, trees etc).

It also depends what you are using GPS for. Most of the YouTube videos I’ve see focus on comparing the GPS tracks between the watches and the distance recorded at the end of the activity. My experience with Garmin has been OK from that perspective although there was a software upgrade about 6 months ago that screwed it up. I use the Fenix 6 for hiking/trail running navigation and it is great.

My real issue with GPS on Garmin is that it is virtually useless for real-time pace calculation. Probably more to do with how they are processing GPS data rather than the GPS chip itself. Whatever the reason, it’s pretty hopeless.

1021,It’s really a fitness and productivity machine. It’s built for your well-being and fitness goals and also making quick reply’s and quick notifications easier to accomplish. So if you aren’t using it to streamline your work emails and calendars or to improve your health metrics tracking goals you won’t get much from it besides a pretty way to see the time.,others
1022,I’ve never heard smart watches pitched as divorcing you from your phone. Maybe just saving some battery. It’s also like a watch so it’s like a fashion statement which is like the only point of the higher-end models like you bought. I use mine a lot for the Home app and flashlight and mainly it lets you see if a notification is dumb or actually worth taking your phone out. I hear a lot of people like them for the alarm because it just taps you on the wrist. Mainly I feel like you paid more and expected more tech but you actually just got more fashion.,battery
1023,"Received my Apple Watch series 6 as a gift. Have had it for a year now and I can’t say I’d have bought it for myself. It’s basically a Fitbit on steroids aka activity tracker plus a ton of additional health related products that have no value to me for a much bigger price tag.
For example things like blood oxygen and heart rate tracking aren’t particularly valuable to me… I have no idea what my blood oxygen should be or why it’s important and the app doesn’t seem to provide much education. The heart rate monitor is unreliable… it fails to get a clear reading as often as it succeeds so I’d never feel comfortable relying on it. You can use it to take a picture from your phone… I do use that on occasion.
Notifications aren’t all that helpful since voice dictation inevitably has typos, but you can’t edit them from the watch. Nor can you read the message you dictated before sending so I always end up pulling out my phone to text or to correct whatever I dictated through the watch. Call quality on the watch is patchy.
I like it for running and sometimes I can sync my audible books to the watch and I love not having to take my phone, but out of 3 books I tried to sync only one ever actually downloaded to the watch. Plus it doesn’t seem to sync with the phone if you do succeed in downloading an audiobook, listen to it on your watch, and then return to the phone you’ll be in a different place than where you left off. 
Couldn’t say what else it’s good for since reading anything on it just makes you pull out your phone, you can’t type on it and the dictation is average at best. I haven’t tried putting it on my phone plan so can’t comment if that would improve my experience. Overall it seems like a gimmick product Apple is using to source data for their healthcare projects.

If you want a product that is a supplement to your phone and allows you to keep your phone out away in social situations while still being on alert then Apple Watch is the choice.

Yes I think it isn’t there yet. Perhaps one running a meant-to-be-stand-alone OS (like a skinned Android) with a Bluetooth mini QWERTY keyboard would the issues I’ve highlighted.

One other consideration that popped up for me a few times is that it’s your phone on your wrist. If you are going to a formal event, it really stands out and makes you look like a SpyKid. I think most smartwatches will, the displays look too 2D to fool anyone that it’s not a ‘real’ watch (even with Always-On).

The screen is small (I have the 38mm) and sometimes hard to tap. The SE would be far better for this. Can be slightly annoying to use at times.

The SE is a little faster. Not that the 3 is particularly slow, but an extra second or so here and there can be noticeable.

In summary, It’s not a huge difference as the essential parts are the same. I mean, its watch that has notifications and can track your movements.  But the incremental improvements are worth the extra money to me.

But they didn’t just visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium with an underwater camera. They built a tank in their studio, and shot a variety of species at 300 frames-per-second on incredibly high-end slow-motion Phantom cameras. Then they shrunk the resulting 4096 x 2304 images to fit the Watch’s screen, which is less than a tenth the size. Now, “when you look at the Motion face of the jellyfish, no reasonable person can see that level of detail,” Dye says. “And yet to us it’s really important to get those details right.”

What's funny is the watch isn't 700, it's considerably cheaper than that for the sport model. So there's even less credibility for the argument even with that flawed method of thinking. He's purposefully inflating the price to support the concept that the price = too high.

When there is news /r/Apple gets flooded with people posting negative stuff and one liners that get upvoted. Check any comment or submission history and it is all /r/android users who flock over to start shit. 

I have devices from both platforms and I spent a lot of time in both subreddits. 

/r/Androidcirclejerk is a joke subreddit. I find that a lot of people there occasionally do an /UJ and actually have more reasonable things to say. ACJ makes fun of /r/android more than /r/Apple.

> No watch is worth 700, unless you're actually going for a watch for pure aesthetic reasons

Guess what? The market says otherwise. I am guessing you are using the ""But I think it's ugly"" argument to ""prove"" it isn't with $700? You don't get it.

> I would never spend 700 dollars on this watch, and neither would many people.

Yeah, but ""many people"" isn't all people. So why sit around and tell people you think they are poorly spending their money because you think their watch isn't pretty. What a waste of time, man. You must be great at parties.

1. Battery life - with AOD on, the S5 didn’t last as long for all of the 7 days. I consistently ended the night with 20% less battery on the S5. I feel like this isn’t a complete dealbreaker, but battery life is more important to me than AOD.
2. Under the same lighting conditions, the S4 was noticeably brighter than the S5. They’re both rated at 1000 nits, but the ambient light sensor on the S5 was overly aggressive for my taste. 
3. When raising to wake, the S5 had a noticeably longer lag before fully lighting up.

These are minor differences, but ultimately I got a much better price for the S4 so I kept that instead. No regrets. Can’t go wrong with either one though.",battery

From a hardware standpoint, all this means is they integrated a variable refresh rate display, which has existed in many other mediums (like 90hz+ phones) for a while now.

It’s a new display, but not a new design. 

I’m not arguing against upgrading to the S5 from the S4; I just think comparing it similarly to the jump between the S3 and S4 is unjustified.

Please note this is my opinion and my opinion shouldn’t affect your purchasing decision.

edit: to clarify my point, take a look at the S4’s display: it’s *objectively* better than the S3’s display. Is an always-on display objectively better than a not-always-on display? No - sure, having the option is objectively better, but the actual feature is subjective.",others

The jump from S3 to S4 was an upgrade for **literally everybody.** The jump from S4 to S5 is an upgrade **for only the people who want an always-on display. Nothing else has changed besides the addition of a compass.**

**Everybody** (within reason) wants a bigger display in the same form factor. You cannot say that **everybody** wants to use the always-on display, and so the jump from S4 to S5 is **less significant** for **most people** than the jump from S3 to S4 was.

""I think it's worth the purchase because this money I lose when I purchase this thing is inconsequential to the happiness I gain from this new thing""

Coincidentally, it's easier to justify the purchase when you have **more** money.

When you have ^less money, it's less painful to justify not buying it. But you still want the new item, so you make the pain of not buying it less by rationalizing that it's not a worthwhile upgrade.

Who's right? Depends on your situation mostly. If you have at least $399 burning in your pockets, then sure. If you don't, then you either convince yourself that you don't need it, and/or you get miserable and argue with random strangers on Reddit.

Would I use an always on display if I had it? Yes, because I have it.  Do I care that my current watch doesn’t have an always on display.  Nope.

On the one hand this isn't such a bad thing since it does the sharpening really well, but on the other hand I don't think it always looks true to life as a result. 

The real problem I see with the Xs and moreso the X is the method of noise reduction Apple applies in their processing. It tends to muddy up details. From what I've seen this is significantly better on the Xs, but still could use some work.

But here's the real question. If we're focusing on the issue of fine detail can we objectively say which one is better? As a Google branded phone user I've always been in the camp of the more detail the better under all circumstances. However, with the introduction of the Xs I'm really not so sure anymore.

1914,"/u/swimbrief, adding you too. So, I think it depends on the issues you had. For me, I had bad sleep for years. Hard to fall asleep, easy to wake up in the morning. Sleep tracking let me try different things and measure whether they worked. 

There were some other benefits too. The tracking sums up your average sleep over a week. If I felt a bit tired but my average was good, prob didn’t need to plan on a nap. If I felt tired and average was bad, probably did. 

I could also see how different foods affected my sleeping heart rate and deep sleep. I figured out certain food triggers and eliminated them. (I often felt worse with these foods, but sometimes I also wake up tired without them. So having the numbers let me make better decisions). 

The waking hrv feature of autosleep is also useful. I’ve found it’s a decent indicator of how hard I can push myself in a workout on a given day. 

If you fall asleep whenever you want and sleep like a baby, there’s no need for tracking. But if you have any sleep issues it’s super helpful.

That said though, I used an Apple Watch Series 2 for about four months a couple years ago and the idea of Jony Ive being a massive watch fan and still not being able to nail the *most basic and central* part of a watch—the time—just feels ridiculous to me. I'm really considering a Series 4 at the moment but the fact that they still haven't managed to have an always-on screen that displays the time without flicking your wrist or tapping the screen is *maddening* to me. It's a *watch* first and foremost, excellent build construction and smart features aside. And a watch that you can't just *glance at* to tell the time is a pretty poor watch to me.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. For ""fashion"" brands such as Invicta, Fossil, MVMT, Daniel Wellington etc then absolutely, you can get something from China for 1/10th the price and they will look just as good.

For actual mechanical pieces and haute horology brands, the markup are still there, but the % becomes much, much less. The attention to detail in manufacturing/assembly makes them very difficult to produce in large quantities, thus driving up the cost. 

This is the [back of an A Lange&Sohne 1815 perpetual calendar](https://www.watchfreeks.com/members/27139-tvdinner-albums-other-picture61738-lange-sohne-1815-rattrapante-perpetual-calendar.jpg), everything you see there is hand finished, hand carved, and hand assembled over hundreds of hours by someone who trained his entire life in the art. And that's why people pay $100k for a piece like that.

Obviously Apple Watch isn't comparable to real haute horology, but as far as detail goes, the Stainless Steel AW had high polish, curved SS case, ceramic back, curved sapphire glass dial, even details like the [digital crown](http://cdn.iphonehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-2.13.48-PM-1024x572.png) are immaculately finished (see how the digital crown is polished stainless steel with [knurling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knurling) applied), and in my opinion absolutely comparable to a mid-tier brand such as Omega or Rolex.

TL;DR: It's all about the details, for 20% last bit extra polish/quality you used to have to pay 5x the price, and Apple get there at a much lower cost.

2134,"> That's fine, but is that because watches with that good fit and finish need to sell as a luxury item, so that higher price is necessary, or because they literally cannot be made for the price Apple charges for their watch? 

I actually don't think they can, Apple can do what they do because of scale and their resources. They were able to bring some high end finishing techniques (eg. one piece curved stainless steel case with high mirror polish) to a scale that wasn't seen before, thus drastically reduce the cost.

Also it helps that the inside of an Apple Watch is electronics, which is cheap in comparison to even the cheapest mass produced Swiss movements, let alone high end in-house hand made movements. But it's still more expensive than a quartz movement, so in the end the credit is still Apple's. 

",others
2135,"Apple custom designs some of the machinery used to build these watches... Their goal was to replicate the fit and finish of an artisan hand-made timepiece, yet they do it with very specialized machines and at a scale that allows them to lower cost. They save price on the movement, of course, since it's all digital inside, but make no mistake, the finishing techniques used are really hard to replicate at scale, and are much more akin to what some artisan watchmaker would use.

What they've done is nearly impossible for any other company, and the quality absolutely cannot be matched by other watchmakers for the price, because they don't have billions in cash to develop custom milling, polishing, extruding, and alloying machines.

What's really driving sales is their marketing, not the benchmarks for your watch.

My H watch was updated for years, still going. Not that watch updates even add that much to begin with.

Speed: Yes, people do care about their watch being responsive. When my Gear S3 decides that it needs to start lagging, it sucks. I lift my arm, wait 3-4 seconds, only to see the time. You don't get that with Apple Watch. Marketing drives their initial sales. Ease of use and speed ensures repeat purchase.
  
Updates: WatchOS updates are pretty consistent and updates apply to all hardware. Only exception, WatchOS 5 does not work on original Apple Watch, which came out 3 years ago. Other series are still supported.
  
Unlocking: I use a mix of things. Macbook for dicking around, PC for doing actual work. Unlock is nice to have. Not critical if I lose it (my macbook has biometrics), but is definitely a nice thing.
  
Shortcuts: I am guessing OP is talking about Shortcuts app, which allows you to create custom Siri workflows. Not what Wear OS has.
  
Google Fit: Perhaps it changed, but last time I used it, it was a steaming turd.",others
2172,"No, it doesn't. Don't get me wrong here, I'm not happy about it. I really wish there was a Wear OS watch that met my needs as well as an Apple Watch because I have quite a strong preference for Android (or more specifically the Galaxy Note range of phones).

The Wear OS watch that I used (HW 2) was horribly slow at loading apps and otherwise generally quite laggy. I could mostly live with that if Android pay loaded quickly but it very often didn't and it was quicker to get my phone out of my pocket - making it functionally useless for payments.

There is an attention to detail in the Apple Watch's activity tracking that extends beyond the external HRM. It's the only smartwatch I've owned that made me take off my dedicated Garmin activity tracker.
It's the only smartwatch that tracks running distance as reliably as a Garmin Forerunner 235. Huawei, Samsung and even Fitbit can be much as 15% out on distance, Apple Watch in my experience is pretty much spot on.

Google Fit, S-Health and Huawei Health's integration with MyFitnessPal is either broken or extremely limited meaning that tracking calories in Vs calories out harder than it should be. That actually true of Apple Watch too but there's a 3rd party app that resolves it. It's not ideal but at least a solution exists.

S-Health and Huawei Health don't appear to take heart rate into consideration when estimating calories burnt in a workout. Just the type of activity and the time spent doing it which is extremely half arsed.

Apple Health estimates my VO2 Max to be about the same as my Garmin does. FitBit and Huawei Health's estimation is way off (probably because of the inaccurate GPS and HR readings), S-Health doesn't even attempt it despite having all the information it needs to do do.
S-Health up to the version that was released a few weeks ago had no way of showing me the number of calories that i'd burnt on pervious days.

I could go on...

As I say, this is just my perspective. These are things that are important to me, others may see things differently and that's fine but I don't think it's just down to marketing. 
There are almost ubiquitous complaints about Wear OS not being as good as Apple Watch in the WearOS sub, I don't think that you can write off posters there as being that influenced by Apples marketing.

Ok, let's see:

* Band design
* Band material
* Band color
* Watch body finish
* Watch body shape (i.e. the same or very similar rounded corner radius, etc.)
* Watch face design (at least in product pictures)

> I get that they look alike...

Ok, so why claim that basically the only similarity is that they are both rectangular? That is what I think is ridiculous since they are clearly a lot more similar than that, which anyone can see. Should that stop anyone from buying it if they like it? No.

> Who gives a shit.

It would certainly prevent me from buying one personally since at least the pictures make it look like a cheap knock-off (despite probably having great build quality). It's just unnecessarily lazy to copy a design to this degree, but it's almost certainly because that's what works well in the Chinese market.

For people who like the Apple Watch look but who wants a watch that works well with Android, this looks like a must-have. Despite what you might think, I actually like that Oppo is getting into the Wear OS game and also like that we once again get multiple form factors for Wear OS watches. If Oppo can generate excitement for the platform and push build quality standards back up, I'm all for it. We've been in a slump for years now in both those areas.",others
2249,Well that’s basically Apple to be precise. They are known for being notorious for exercising control everywhere possible. AOD is ok for me at least. Cannot say about other’s experience though but I am fine with it. Same goes for the battery life. And obviously Apple being Apple they will keep their bands proprietary. Hell they haven’t phased out lightning ports on iPhone till now. Price wise - yes it’s overpriced. But then this is Apple. It’s not like I am trying to defend them here. But that’s how they have always been. They are just too focused on their revenues and they know that people are willing to shell out money (at least for now). So why not cash in on that opportunity.

I don't think this means what most people think it means. Sometimes you put something out and see where it goes. I would almost bet you that if it'd not been taken up by sport-y people and, instead, only CEO's and such -- we'd see a very different Apple Watch.

It's little different from the early stages of smartphones and how they've transitioned to what they are now.

>  It has always been primarily about activity tracking and notifications.

Eh, it's been ""meh"" *at best* for activity tracking relative to all the other devices. It's goal was to be the iPhone of the smartwatches -- a little bit of everything and looked to see where it'd go. Like smartphones you just start throwing things in and see what sticks.

Look Apple doesn't need you to defend them from The Verge. I'm sure they can handle that on their own.

> Complete with awkward staged video to make notifications in the wrist look as bad as possible.

Actually handling some notifications **is** awkward. Try responding to a text on a tram. You'll see how awkwardly difficult it is. This doesn't make it a bad product, like I suspect you're afraid of people claiming, it's just the nature of the product. Certain conditions are very awkward.

You'd do well to remember the iPhone was released after Android and Windows Mobile. There were *many* iterations well before the iPhone and iPod. The Apple Watch, like all other smart watches, are going through this phase. It's a *slow* process that takes years to refine. My modern iPhone has a note taking app that's basically the exact same that Windows 95 had. Does that mean nothing has changed since then? Of course not. Give things time. If in 10 years the Apple Watch doesn't change or hasn't found its spot -- I'll be genuinely surprised but if you think the Apple Watch 10 years from now is going to be heading the same direction the one is now you're fooling yourself and not giving Apple enough credit.",others

I say this as a day 1 watch owner. Very little has changed about what the watch is “for”, there has been no revolutionary new feature that changes anything.

People have changed their minds and apple market it differently. The core functionality of the watch hasn’t changed much at all.

My issue with the verge was the initial review complained about the concept and the “what’s it for” narrative. They even staged a video of Nilay having dinner and being “interrupted” by notifications on his wrist to demonstrate how “bad” that idea is...

What the watch is “for” has barely changed at all since series 0, there is nothing to justify claiming that Apple has “figured that out” thus justifying previous poor reviews for that reason and current good reviews when in reality usage and core functionality (notifications, activity tracking and light apps) has not changed at all.",others

2381,">	I’m saying that the verge is echoing what Apple is saying

Apple was saying there’s no point to the watch? That notifications were bad?

So rather than do a real review with any good analysis you’re saying Nilay 1) echoed apples marketing and 2) criticised the watch for something the Verge now says is awesome despite nothing changing (notifications and function)?

That’s pretty crappy journalism. Which is my point. Again, a review is a critical analysis of a product. Not a regurgitation of marketing nor making issues where there are none for clicks.

>	I can empathize with that. I think what they were saying though was that notifications on your wrist could pull our attention away from real life even more, despite what Apple was saying which was that this will help you focus on the important things.

Of course the watch also has silent and do not disturb modes if you don’t want notifications, which wasn’t mentioned during this section of how ”bad” notifications on the wrist were. The attention deficit of the reviewer is an issue with the reviewer not an issue with the product. So basically doing a hit piece on the watch and making it to look as bad as possible on purpose is good journalism?

And the same reviewer gave the Pebble Watch a glowing review raving about how great notifications on the wrist are before the Apple Watch release...

There is a sliver of a point there as you allude to  But not the mountain made out of the molehill, nor the way is was conveyed - staged and ridiculous video making the watch look as bad as possible.

Nilay’s Apple Watch review is notorious for all the wrong reasons. This was also the review where he criticised the styling of the watch while wearing his awful spiked bracelet, then people mocked him for this fashion choice and he threw a tantrum.

That entire review was one of the low points of the Verge. Click bait, ego centric, poor critical analysis of the product, hypocritical. It was just garbage journalism. It’s become a meme about ridiculous complaints and got Nilay the reputation he has today.

Dieter does a great job with the series 4 review though.",others

I think Apple would be well served to sell a mass-market Macbook and I suppose the air is the closest equivalent. Their naming scene right now is confusing because ""Macbook"" is a lot more expensive than ""Macbook Air"" although I guess that makes sense in some strange way.

Either way it sounds like we are on the same page. Apple products are expensive; overpriced would imply there is an alternative/ identical device that is cheaper.

While the average consumer may only need an iPad mini, if they buy a Macbook Pro that doesn't make the MBP overpriced. Rather, it is customers ponying up a premium for an experience full of features that they likely do not need.",others

The fact that I don't own a PC now its all Ipads/Iphones makes it a no-go.  I usually like to run without my phone so I like to have music stored on the watch.  I'm starting to lean now on picking up an Apple watch SE and use it strictly for running/working out like the OP.

2430,"I guess I should've made this more explicit in my original post, sorry about that. The main reasons were my disappointment in the (then highly recommended and well-reviewed) Polar M200 and my implicit trust in Apple as a company. 

I originally considered the then-current Apple Watch (maybe Series 2?) before buying the Polar years ago, but thought that the AW was too expensive, and it would be silly to buy an actual smartwatch just for running, as you're saying. This was a decision I came to immensely regret, as I detailed in my original post.

A relevant anecdote: a couple of years ago I moved to a significantly larger apartment and found myself in need of a Wi-Fi extender/repeater. Apple had just announced that they were discontinuing their Airport line of Wi-Fi routers, including the AirPort Express, which can also be used as a Wi-Fi extender/repeater. The AE was still available through retailers, however, but I decided that it would be crazy to buy a 99 € discontinued device with outdated technology and a somewhat poor feature set. After this, I tried out three different extenders from three different companies, which were all cheaper yet ""better"" (specs-wise, on paper) than the Apple device. Not one of them worked reliably or had a decent range. Frustrated, I eventually bought the even-then outdated AirPort Express and have been happy with it ever since. As the clichéd saying goes, it just works. Theoretically, it might not be the best product for me to get, but it gets the job done, requires absolutely no maintenance and is rock-solid reliable. Same with the Apple Watch SE (at least for now, knock on wood).

So, taking both these things into consideration it was a sort ""fool me once"" situation. This time around I am not regretting my decision, at all, even though I'd be the first to admit that buying an Apple Watch only for running is definitely overkill. I'd much rather buy something a bit too expensive and feature-poor (as a running watch) which is hassle-free and 100 % reliable than mock about with brands I have no experience with.",others

Really? Sorry that makes you sound a bit fanboyish. There are way way more bands with the standard lugs 18, 20, 22 mm system that all kinds of wrist watches have been using for decades if not longer than there are Apple Watch specific bands.

And Apple's system has two advantages over standard quick release bands, other than locking you into an ecosystem. 

> Awesome watchface

Same as above. We can design our own watchfaces with multiple very powerful apps, including all kinds of fluid full screen animation, complications and such. The Playstore as well as those watchfaces designers are full of very quality watchfaces. This is again a clear advantage for Wear OS.

The active 2 was fluid and fast enough. 

Bixby wasn’t great on the watch but I downloaded a third party Google assistant app. It worked well enough. I would hope that the Google assistant comes to the watch 4 in time. 

Samsung have more watch faces but Apple’s watch faces have better complications. For example on the watch face I have now I have 2 pictures of my children, a complication to control my Apple TV and a complication to control playback on my homepods. I didn’t see an option for that on the Samsung watch. The complications were largely determined by the watch face developer. On the Apple Watch you can basically have a complication for any app you have installed on the watch. However what I will say is that the complications had improved from the galaxy watch to the active 2. It had a lot of basic complications like fitness, health measurements, time, weather, date etc 

In terms of health sensors the watch 4 is now ahead of the Apple Watch. It can do pulse, o2 saturation, ECG, blood pressure and BIA. 

Samsung pay works well enough. Notifications came through as expected.

Native sleep tracking was better on the Samsung watch. Although I’m using a very good third party one on the Apple Watch. 


I think it comes down to how you use your watch. 

I use mine for notifications, very light fitness tracking, setting reminders, sleep tracking, flashlight, responding to messages, triaging phone calls, Apple Pay. 

Most of this I could do on a Samsung watch. The things the Samsung watch doesn’t do that I also use on my Apple Watch is:

Being able to control my Apple TV’s from my watch 

Being able to control my homepods from my watch. 

As far as I know there is no way at present to control a chromecast or Google home speakers from a Samsung watch. However this might change now that it runs wear OS. 

I personally don’t use music playback on my Apple Watch. However this is better on the Apple Watch. It also had more space for off line storage and you can also store audiobooks and podcasts. 

If you’re big into fitness which I am not lol then fitness + is superior as it links in with your Apple Watch as you are doing workouts and gives you real time feedback on your Apple TV.

All the data is there, you need to make sense of it anyways, you know why people prefer a good all around metric?

So they don’t have to make sense of all the things involved to get such metric.

I know for a fact that any sport watches use resting HR, HRV and some sort of extra calculated strain, whether it is time spent in 4+ HR zones, or HRV decline through the day, you can try and built something even in the shortcuts, but without the science behind it, like polar, garmin, sunto, and so many other options.

It does not make sense, you will lack most of the science behind them, and more likely even the context.

So yeah, Apple Watch does not compare by any means.

Sports oriented devices are not that much expensive, AW costs almost the same as some of the top end forerunner, or vantage line up, those will have software support for at least 2-3 active years, and most of those devices will last 4 years without any issues.

Does that make AW a bad device?

Not by any means, in fact AW since series 4 are the best Wrist HR based devices out there, matching almost perfectly a Polar H10, the fact that they don’t give you any useful metrics just sucks, they have the data, and its accurate to a 98+% when compared against a chest strap .

The fact that you have a lot of apps that claim to give you those useful metrics without any scientific background just makes the point worse. 

The watchface you shared is a living example of that, with the same data Athlytic app is telling me that im ready to go all in, but the training today is telling me, listen if you go higher than HR zone 3 you’re gonna be fucked up...

• I’m completely device agnostic. Currently wearing Apple Watch 6 (and 4 if the 6 is charging) and a Polar Grit X. Adding Garmin 955 assuming my hunch is right and it’s announced in a few weeks. 

• I never said the Watch is better than, or on par with, a top end dedicated sports watch. But it’s better than people who review it based only on default apps/software give it credit for. Since this sub is an Apple Watch sub it seems appropriate to restrict my discussion/posts to that device. 

• The watchfaces as pictured in this post are using generic sample data in complications, so commenting on discrepancies between non-existent data is a waste of your time. 

•  Neither of us are in a position to claim whether or not these apps incorporate peer-reviewed science in how they analyze the raw health data. I can say that when testing Training Today vs Garmin’s Body Battery (using an old Vivoactive 4, so admittedly not the best oHRM) for a month the two were consistently in agreement. I probably should take a month to correlate the watch apps vs Polar’s ANS recovery score but since leaving academia I’m way less passionate about random poking at data.

As for current glucose monitoring, using a CGM with a smartphone is a nightmare as the FDA has to approve each version of the device’s app. This often means you can’t update your OS or risk your monitor no longer working.

I would assume that they'd need to deal with any sort of glucose monitoring function in roughly the same way the EKG function (which IIRC also required FDA approval) is managed. I'm not sure of the particular details of what's required for that, but I'd guess it's similar to other medical devices.",others

At the end of the day, the person who stayed at a value hotel is going to have the same overall experience, but the presidential suite traveler is going to say “at least I stayed in the most expensive room though”.

-	You can fuel up a car and leave it for a week and its gonna have exactly the same amount of fuel when you leave it.

Agree to disagree eh? I just don’t understand this logic.

So you’re either always aware of what day you last charged your watch or constantly checking how much battery your watch has?

Perhaps. 

But at least I'm not splitting hairs to try to make my absolutely nonsensical opinion fit.

Do you really not see how less battery life is not ideal? It's not a complicated concept. You keep going on and on about routine but fail to realize that if it lasted 5 days, you could still have a routine... just not daily. 

To answer your question: yes I am always 100% aware of my battery charge status. And on my previous fitbit that lasted 3-4 days, when I saw it was at or around 15% battery I knew I could still go like 12-24 hours with it before I needed to recharge. It's really nice seeing 15% battery and not having to rush to a charger or have that be on the back of your head like if you're at the gym or went for a walk with your dog or something.",battery

Let’s put it this way, if I came into a fortune I could dock around with, I would pay off student debts and buy a house first. I would probably upgrade my car, but I wouldn’t be buying a Ferrari or anything like that. Other than that…. I don’t really think my spending would change all that much if at all.",others

Agree that the Wear OS app has to be open in the background, but this doesn't bother me. And I did find out the headphone trick (Jabra 75t) and TBH I prefer to run off their mic rather than the watch.

Like I said, I don’t own a Watch, but it kinda feels like they’re at a point now where like the iPhone and iPad, the annual updates aren’t always going to change the world of its users. Some of the health sensor rumours that were knocking about seem like they’re years out from now and all that leaves is iterative changes for them to toy with in the in-between years.

2771,I love this years red braided solo loop,strap
2772,Red is easily my favorite of the S7 aluminum watches. Doesn’t hurt that I love my S6 red. Congrats on your S7.,watch face
2773,"Awesome, the solo loop fits perfectly to your watch",watch face
2774,"Wait does the S7 come with an extra silicone band regardless of if you paid for a certain band of choice? I just ordered one, and was wondering",others
2775,Looks great! I’m waiting for next years watch hopefully redesigned. I’ll replace the series 4 battery to use it for another year.,battery
2776,"I’m thinking about upgrading my S6 44mm to the S7 41mm. I have small wrist and although the 44 looks alright. I think the 41 will look slightly better. But after seeing all the reviews, i’ll wait till next year just like when I’lll upgrade my phone. The watchface looks sick though, but the glare sorta bugs me.",watch face
2777,Hey. Do you have more pictures of S7 with different bands? (Preferably black/white),others
2778,These colors are just awful.,others
2779,The answer is yes. This watch face is exclusive to series 7.,watch face
2780,Look in YouTube for other Series.,others
2781,I love the PRODUCT RED. It stands out and looks so much cooler than the black case I had before.,others
2782,"Nope, the band came in a separate little box. There was an empty box where the silicon band would be. Basically you only get one band.",others
2783,okay now i just saw cool watch faces like the pip boy and others. that not going well with product red. but i really like color red 😩,watch face
2784,"That’s what my parents said hahah. They were like the 41 mm looks more feminine, while the 45 looks much more fitting. I did try it on in store, but it was hard to tell from my perspective so I just trusted a third point of view. Heard that the screen is also bigger so I guess that’s a good plus too",others
2785,That looks great. Thank you. I have one more question.. have you tried on different watch faces on the red? Do they seem unfit if the colours don’t match the redness of the watch? For example - the contour face with numbers in yellow. I want to go for red but am hesitant because of its versatility.,watch face
2786,I can show you different watch faces. Which ones did you want to see,watch face
2787,Yes yes. That’s exactly what I wanted to see. Somehow the red is toned down and doesn’t cancel out other colours.,others
2788,"Yes, the red case isn’t that prominent. The bands stand out more.",others
2789,"Except black, what all bands do you think it will look great, and not tacky?",others
