0,"I imagine the space gray aluminum was the single most popular Apple Watch model. Getting rid of it was a pretty naked attempt at trying to force people into a SS or titanium, but I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out.",watch face,negative
1,"Basically, it‚Äôs Apple Watch Series 6s?",watch face,negative
2,"I will say, seeing videos of the watches in natural light does help - the starlight looks about like how I expected in that champagne kind of color and the midnight and green are both a lot darker than I expected which is a pleasant surprise.",watch face,positive
3,"I wonder if Apple will ever update the aluminum version of the apple watch with a sapphire display. My series 3 aluminum face is scratched to hell, but the massive increase in price to the steel/ceramic/titanium just seems not worth it.",watch face,negative
4,Basically the Verge‚Äôs video conclusion lmao.,watch face,positive
5,Hard edge Apple Watch would suck for working out / sports,watch face,negative
6,I think all of us that use an analog watch face agree that its ridiculous that we don't have 120Hz or higher yet. Watching the second hand move on my current Apple watch only compels me to stab my eyes out with an Apple Pencil.,watch face,negative

20,"This just in‚Ä¶reviewers confirm what we have already known since the Apple Keynote: the Series 7 is just a Series 6 with a slightly larger screen and two new watch faces.

Whether that is worth the purchase price is entirely up to you, but I‚Äôd imagine that most Series 5 and 6 owners can sit tight for the time being until Apple adds something more meaningful to the watch.",watch face,positive

28,"> Totally expect next years model to take the iphone route (hard edges) 

Why would people want hard edges on a watch though? Unless they figure out how to make it much thinner, I guess. Otherwise, give me the contours.",watch face,negative

30,"The main driver wouldn‚Äôt be the different colour, it would be scratch resistance. 

I smacked it off a door frame really hard. There was a mark. I was devastated. Turns out, the watch had taken paint and a tiny bit of wood off the door frame. A quick wipe and it was good as new!",watch face,negative
31,"Watches are usually boring. They tell the time with a static and monotonous face. Apple made one with a screen that looks high-class and has a designer touch, and hey, you get the thrill of customization too. 

Comparing it to other smart watches doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. Most Apple Watch users are regular watch owners. They don‚Äôt need a million cheap thrills to be entertained by their wearables. 

Also, this is an Apple Watch sub... guess you‚Äôre not exactly going for high post karma OP.",watch face,positive

48,"I fainted 7 months ago, and my Apple Watch (whatever the one that came out 2 years ago) caught it. Not nearly as many ‚Äúfalls‚Äù caught as me being rough in general playing sports, chopping wood etc, those are a pain. I got up after I fainted completely dazed panicking to shutoff the emergency phone countdown thing though",watch face,negative
49,My big draw is that I don‚Äôt have my phone buzzing away in class; every notification goes to my watch that I can swipe away quick and discreet. Except gmail for some fucking reason because I can‚Äôt mark gmail messages as read from the lock or notification screen even on my phone.,watch face,negative
50,Can the 3‚Äôs display support the new watch faces? I mainly want a watch for working out but I really like the size of the SE‚Äôs display,watch face,positive
51,"I just upgraded from 3 to SE and would never recommend 3. No memory, about to lose software support, smaller screen, etc. 
Yes there are people who would be just fine with a 3, but most should just go for the SE as their first watch.",watch face,negative
52,And I want a Samsung watch with the square.,watch face,negative
53,I had a Fitbit for workout/calories. Went for the SE as has the same functionality plus and respond to messages and take calls on it while near my phone so if I‚Äôm working outside my phone is in the house and can still use it. I also use my watch to open my garage door which is just fun.,watch face,positive

56,Does the SE have an always-on display?,watch face,negative
57,It‚Äôs easily the best looking smartwatch out there though.,watch face,positive
58,The SE would have the same always on brightness as the S5 because they have the same chip (half as bright as the 6). Tbh I bet someone could jailbreak that into watch OS for the SE.,watch face,positive
59,"I have the Series 4 watch and the fall feature is iffy. It‚Äôs gone off when I crush garlic or flop on the couch, but not when I legit collapsed while running. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve improved the feature. I hope so.",watch face,positive
60,Ah the series 4 the one that was the first Apple Watch to have fall detection.,watch face,negative
61,"It's not the ECG I'm after.

Fall detection is a feature where if he feints and falls to the ground, the watch will make his phone call me. If I don't pick up it'll call my mother. If she doesn't pick up it'll call  for an ambulance.",watch face,negative
62,Google it.  People are showing watch results vs proper pulse oximiter results. The top of the wrist is a poor spot to measure O2 sat.,watch face,negative
63,That‚Äôs cool. I actually got outta my charge 2 to get my S3. Had it for a year now and am PISSED to see that it‚Äôs already practically outdated (not getting any watch faces except the shit ones. Would kill for infograph which would be an upgrade over modular),watch face,negative
64,You‚Äôre a dumbass,watch face,negative
65,Agreed. It‚Äôs such a smart dumb watch. Serious trash. Have a ionic that has been replaced 5 times. They won‚Äôt give me back money.,watch face,negative
66,"You can download your podcasts to the watch no?

Like if you are using something like Spotify and I think the Apple service",watch face,negative
67,"I dont think they are out of date, the watch series 1 still works perfectly.",watch face,positive
68,That‚Äôs my whole point : this Watch SE does not have always on display or any other sensor that the S1 didn‚Äôt have. They both have the heartbeat sensor and that‚Äôs about it.,watch face,negative
69,"It is legitimately useful to have cellular, but the cost is what is preventing me from purchasing another Watch. $5 a month would be more reasonable. Or even a discounted price for monthly service to buy directly from T-mobile or whatever. 

My series 1 would be out of range when I was on the other side of my normal to small sized house. It would have also been useful at my retail job I had at the time when the break room walls prevented signal despite it being a boutique store.",watch face,positive
70,"Ah... Ok then, well samsung watch not bad either.",watch face,positive
71,That's a taste thing but I find it ugly as fuck. Samsung's watch-shaped watch with a wheel scroll is in my opinion the best design for a watch so far.,watch face,negative
72,Galaxy Watch 3 and Active 2 still work perfectly with iPhones.,watch face,positive
73,The $40 pulse ox meter that goes on my finger which I bought from cvs is more accurate than the sensor on the $400 watch.,watch face,negative
74,"I got the 6 a few weeks ago, and have turned off the always on display. I upgraded from a 4 and have never had an issue really with raise to wake, so didn‚Äôt see the need after a few days with the 6. The only time I could see it being a benefit is with certain workout types where it‚Äôs harder to raise you wrist to see the watch face.",watch face,positive
75,It does light up when you turn your wrist and look at it. But sometimes you just want to see what time it is without turning your wrist or at a weird angle. The AOD is a big deal IMO.,watch face,negative
76,it does and it works 100% but with AOD you always have a clockface on the watch whether youre holding it up or not,watch face,negative
77,"It just looks nicer imo, it looks like a watch instead of a screen strapped to your wrist",watch face,positive
78,"I don‚Äôt remember turning it on , but my watch set it off when I ate shit mountain biking in august",watch face,negative
79,It will also work with wifi only watches. It is just limited to wifi networks like an iPod Touch or iPad wifi only. That can work for some people if they are in wifi coverage most of the time.,watch face,negative
80,"Ah see, you failed to understand the premise of a debate. This man made an unaccountable claim, therefore he is the one who should be providing the ‚Äòproof‚Äô.",watch face,negative
81,I feel you! I have the versa 2 and the watchfaces leave a lot to be desired. Tbh I‚Äôll probably be switching to the Apple Watch SE,watch face,negative
82,"Ah, makes sense. I didn‚Äôt end up tuning in because I didn‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be any big surprised. Cheers.",watch face,positive
83,"the announcement according to the media was just ""there is no new iphone, sell your stocks""

but I like the idea of an apple watch SE",watch face,negative
84,"Nothing really, I mean at the end of the day it is a watch not a full on phone so no YouTube or whatever lol. I got mine for $250 all in so couldn‚Äôt justify $500+ for an ECG and oxygen sensor",watch face,negative

87,"Ah yes the U1 chip so I can unlock my $60,000 BMW that hadn‚Äôt even been released yet and the faster processor because I‚Äôm encoding video on my watch.",watch face,negative
88,"If you are genuinely concerned, reach out to a professional. However if you were just reading too much into webMD and the watch helped you settle down a bit, success! I would still ask a professional though. Even if it‚Äôs an over the phone consultation. Glad you‚Äôre mentally feeling better about it",watch face,positive
89,I think that is because there is such a lack of incentives. There isn‚Äôt much that can be done that reasonable for a watch jailbreak. With a software lock like this I‚Äôm sure someone/group will want to break it.,watch face,positive
90,"I'd like to point out that during Hurricane Katrina, all Teslas in the Pan Handle we're uncapped allowing an even greater distance beyond the range of what the car's distance was purchased at.",watch face,positive
91,"There are thousands of watch faces for the Versa. And if you don‚Äôt like any of those, you can make your own. It‚Äôs quite easy.",watch face,positive
92,"Eh, either way the EKG we‚Äôre talking about here is one lead. Hardly something people should rely on. Further, the one lead EKG is literally only useful for A-fib, not any other arrhythmia. 

As for those without ‚Äúheart problems‚Äù, the ekg may pick up a-fib in some patients. This can be problematic. In medicine, sometimes wide-spread screening isn‚Äôt always a good thing. If a one lead EKG shows a-fib in a seemingly healthy individual, that person would probably want to go get a work up. Expensive, and many times unnecessary, and probably has a low sensitivity for actually picking up an actual problem. That means unnecessary testing. Just some devils advocate here",watch face,negative
93,"Actually, even stainless steel can corrode easily in some circumstances. Stainless does not mean rust-proof, and when galvanic corrosion occurs, it is usually even nastier than normal steel corrosion/rust.


But to answer your question, aluminium can corrode. The aluminium on the apple watch is probably anodized, so it is already corroded to begin with (controlled corrosion which is also dyed for the colour). The more corroded it gets, the slower it corrodes further (unlike steel which just corrodes constantly, aluminium corrosion is a protective layer).

In some circumstances aluminium can get a very agressive corrosion which is quite nasty (e.g. in salt water, alloy boat engines can corrode badly... maybe something similar on a tiny scale can occur on your hand too, with salty sweat...).",watch face,negative
94,I‚Äôve heard that and I get it but that‚Äôs kinda how I hold my phone when I FaceTime anyway. And I just wanna be Dick Tracy lol not much practicality to it.,watch face,negative
95,"Some watch faces have a second hand, but yeah 1fpm would probably be preferable. I could be wrong about the 1fps though.",watch face,negative
96,"Offline via watch. I wanted to leave the phone at home and listen to a podcast on my run with just the watch.

It does that but not perfectly.",watch face,negative
97,"It actually can‚Äôt detect an MI. It can only recognize afib. I think it might register a ‚Äúsee your doctor‚Äù or something though. Regardless, people with the watch probably lean towards younger and able to afford good healthcare with regular visits... so yeah, not sure that one lead ecg moves the needle much besides a couple rare anecdotes.",watch face,positive
98,"Driving is one of my biggest use cases for the Apple Watch. Directions at a glance on my wrist, I can speak to text people, and the changing songs is faster than my cars  terrible touch screen and software",watch face,negative

102,"Looks like here it‚Äôs were we meet to die last holder of Apple Watch series 0 , I hold the all black steel sapphire glass ... still holding up .. thought I wish I had more processing power",watch face,negative
103,"He's not wrong. Watch oximeter isn't cleared by FDA, they aren't accurate. Watches are using light sensor on top of your wrist where the skin thickness and permeability varies and hence this measurement cannot be accurate. It's a toy oximeter when it can't give medically accurate results.",watch face,negative
104,"I knew this is where this was headed, thus I didn‚Äôt even bother.  Facts don‚Äôt seem to matter.  Next they will ask you to prove the earth is round and vaccines are safe.  I have much better things to do (as I‚Äôm sure you do as well) than feed the trolls.",watch face,positive
105,Not with that attitude!,watch face,negative
106,I'm sorry I didn't mean for my comment to come off like that.  Was just trying to say there are cheaper ways to get what your looking for than a new apple watch. I totally get the frustration with our medical system I've experienced it and seen how it can screw over people.,watch face,negative
107,"Fucking weirdo stalker I see...

Bravo to you, having all that free time.",watch face,negative
108,"When people make comments like that and try to use it to add credit to their baseless claims it's nice to check and see if their history backs that. 

To me, you didnt seem like a doctor so I checked your reddit profile in about 5 minutes. A weirdo stalker? Perhaps. At least I'm not pretending to be a doctor when I'm not one. That's pretty fucking dangerous when you use it to spread misinformation

Taking a couple first aid classes on the job does not make you a doctor.",watch face,negative
109,You got caught lying lmao,watch face,negative

111,Liar liar pants on fire good thing thing you‚Äôre a ‚Äúfirefighter‚Äù,watch face,negative
112,"I'm REALLY disappointed with the sapphire crystal on my Series 7. I had a Garmin watch with sapphire crystal as an everyday wear for over 3 years, the bezel was scratched to hell but the glass was flawless. 

I've had my Series 7 for 2 months and the glass is already scratched.",watch face,negative
113,Meh. Garmin is a watch done right. There is no reason why consumers should have to charge a watch every second day,watch face,negative
114,Apple makes an effort to be horology adjacent in its Watch branding. The real reason though is probably because Ben Clymer likes Apple.,watch face,negative
115,Listen to music at the gym. Phone calls when APs connected. Set timers and alarms. Fall detection - how much that soothes the other half. Apple pay. Travel. A quick glance at your wrist instead of getting your phone out and unlocking it,watch face,negative
116,"Can get time with an awesome all time on display(like other watches), the most important thing.
Can track a run,  get direction, pay without picking a phone, use as a kitchen timer, calculate an amount of water, get today's weather and degree.
It is smart enough for me.",watch face,positive
117,"The watch has full controls for the music from your phone. You can also download music onto the watch. Great for the gym or you forget your phone.. No getting phine out of pocket and negotiating if it want passcode or is happy with face with a mask. don‚Äôt need your phone to Apple pay.

oh. It tells you the time.",watch face,positive
118,Yeah I drive an ancient shitbox with no infotainment system and it‚Äôs much safer and convenient to control music from my watch than taking my eyes off the road to fish for my phone,watch face,negative
119,"At first, I loved having all the features and notifications on my wrist. But I still found myself pulling my phone out for most things. Siri on my S3 became so slow and unresponsive that I flat out turned it off. I took the complications off my watch face except date and weather. I find myself wanting to disconnect more apps from my watch more often than I use them.  

It's a nice workout companion, especially if you can't bring your phone around with you when you do whatever you do. But for everyday wear, I really think I'll spend $400 toward a Hamilton or something nice instead of an S5 or S6.",watch face,positive
120,I get constant messages from team members at work. Looking at the watch quickly and sending off a one or two response is useful.,watch face,negative
121,"I‚Äôm usually in meetings a lot and my Apple Watch helps me check messages and emails when they come in. So for me, it‚Äôs so worth it.",watch face,positive
122,"For me it‚Äôs the notifications, the calls that I take while driving, the hearth rate monitor... It‚Äôs worth it.

And I know that a lot of people, like me, are a little paranoid and they constantly feel a false sense of  vibration from their phones in the pockets... wearing the watch gets rid of the false feeling. You‚Äôll know when a notification is sent on your wrist.",watch face,negative
123,I use the Watch for 95% of all my payments. It‚Äôs so convenient. That alone makes it worth it. Add to that all the other amazing stuff it does.,watch face,positive
124,It's so useful to not have to pull out my phone to do most of what I want to do now. I am even typing this on my watch right now.,watch face,positive
125,Hell yeah it is. I like it just as a neat digital watch!,watch face,negative
126,"For me it‚Äôs worth it as it works way better than my old Fitbit, you can see a lot of info at a glance, you don‚Äôt have to pull out your phone to use Siri, can change music easily, check notifications, make phone calls, and it can be set up to track irregular heartbeats.   

I‚Äôm trying to get into shape again but my heart isn‚Äôt in the best shape and the other day said my heartbeat was irregular. I checked on my omron blood pressure monitor to verify and my diastolic and systolic numbers were high. I had to take a pill to get them back to normal. If i didn‚Äôt have this watch I‚Äôm not sure i ever would have known and who knows what could have happened. It‚Äôs nowhere near as accurate as a cuff or chest blood pressure monitor, but you can‚Äôt wear those all the time.",watch face,negative
127,"I have the GPS version and LOVE IT!!  As a watch it‚Äôs great to control my home, and fitness device also if I forget my wallet no problem and great to find your iPhone when it‚Äôs slid down the sofa...   the only problem is I don‚Äôt want to wear my Rolex anymore",watch face,positive
128,I use a fit bit blaze for all the features you mentioned 200$ the apple watch makes calls and  takes pictures more than I would ever want my watch to do. Blaze also tracks my sleep which is very helpful,watch face,positive
129,apple employee here: worth it if you regularly work out,watch face,negative
130,"If you can afford it, it‚Äôs totally worth it. I use it for notifications, fitness tracking, timers, and Apple Pay mostly. If you‚Äôre on the fence, get an older model and see how much you like it.  I also have complications on my watch face so I can see the weather and S&P 500 at a glance.",watch face,positive
131,"I can‚Äôt get used to anything you wear. Tried the watch and it feels like a handcuff to me. Tried AirPods and they felt like ear weights. I guess I‚Äôm just a phone guy. As much as I love tech, I‚Äôm not for wearing it.",watch face,positive
132,My watch (4) best thing i ever bought. Worth every penny. Leaving phone at home is fab.,watch face,positive
133,"I have one and now I wouldn't be without one. Having said that it's not essential, it's just really convenient. Key things I like

\- I can use it to find out where I left my phone !

\- it automatically unlocks my laptop

\- easily see and silence incoming calls

\- fitness reminders help me be a little more active

\- a watch app works with my two factor auth at work making that convenient

\- easy access to alarms and timers

\- see new texts (although its not great for sending them)

\- directions on the watch when walking

\- music and podcast controls on the watch

Also some very nice watch faces with weather info and appointment reminders.",watch face,positive
134,"Probably not. If you have to ask, definitely not. End of story, turn the page.",watch face,negative
135,"As much as a hate to admit it, you‚Äôre totally right. Anytime I don‚Äôt fill the rings the watch never ceases to remind me that I‚Äôm not quite where I should be lol",watch face,negative
136,I always have my phone on silent now as the tapping the watch does on your wrist will make you never miss anything.,watch face,negative

143,"It gave me a bunch of stand notifications. I had a pinched nerve in my butt from driving too much, and the sessions were working, but the pain would still come back.

147,iJustine is queen!,watch face,negative
148,I have the Apple Watch SE and it does the job for workout. I have more than enough info I need for when I work out. Only drawbacks are you get no ECG and always on display.

149,"FYI If you want to leave your phone at home - you need to get the Cellular model.

158,"Apple Watch changed my life. I have it since september 2020 and I wore it every day since then.

However, it is a personal matter. On TikTok there are many reels of people claiming to have wasted money leaving the AW unloaded in a drawer. This is not my case. The watch made me want to run and train and I have never stopped since. The function of the rings works on my person, despite being a person who has always been fit, I used to have that extra kilos that I can now keep under control and do good for my health. 

Another point is that it is definitely a nice item, so it is also very nice to wear for everyday life or an elegant dinner. Best money spent in my life honestly.

Favourite Watch-face: Chronograph pro. But I switch them everyday!",watch face,positive
159,"Personally I wouldn‚Äôt say it improved my life a lot; I would say I was improving my own life through careful curation of my technology and AW suited my needs.

163,"Since I started using my watch as a fitness device, I‚Äôve lost 17kg or 37 pounds. The rings keep me motivated to exercise everyday and because of that im the fittest and healthiest I‚Äôve ever been.

So to me, it absolutely is worth it",watch face,positive
164,Likely different for me as I'm much older. It encouraged me to get out and about and as a result I lost some weight. I can get notifications at work when I can't have my phone with me and it's also helped me to get better sleep. Frankly had I not had the watch I'd have gone back to Android.,watch face,negative
165,"I‚Äôve had mine for 2.5 years now.  What I like about it:
1. It‚Äôs a watch - time, timers, alarms, date, I forgot what it was like to wear a useful watch.  
2. Fitness - The rings really do motivate me to be more active than I was before.  Now I have to close all the rings and meet the challenges which Has been great during this coronavirus era of staying at home.  
3. Ping my iPhone - It seems silly but instead of asking for someone to call my phone when it‚Äôs somewhere in the house just pinging it has been great.  (It falls between the crack of your car seat, under the couch, etc.)  
4.  Outlook meeting details.  I setup a watch face for work, and the middle is an Oulook complication that tells me when and where the next meeting is.  
5.  World Time - I work with people on the other side of the globe, so another work complication is world time for their time zone.  

Lesser things:  
1. When using AirPods and playing something on your phone, you can use the Digital Crown to adjust the volume.  
2. Easy use of HomeKit - When I‚Äôm exercising I can use it to lock/unlock the door.  
3.  Remote iPhone Camera control - for group photos it‚Äôs nice to see the framing and to trigger the shutter remotely.

Overall, I‚Äôm glad I got the series 3 when I did.  It wasn‚Äôt too much and I‚Äôve gotten a lot out of it.  I‚Äôm considering upgrading to a S7 Cellular to get the extra health items and to be able to stream Apple Music directly without a phone when I workout.",watch face,positive

167,"I think the Apple Watch is a device that really is in a new niche the way the iPad was when it first came out. It‚Äôs really hard to know in advance if it‚Äôs for you or not. 

A month ago, I was a firm ‚Äúno‚Äù on the Watch. It was cool, but what did I really need it for? 

Three weeks ago, it happened that managed to sell a few items for more cash than I expected and Best Buy was having a major sale on Apple Watches. On a whim, I read up a little again on what the Watch can do and I started to reconsider. I took a few days to think but ultimately decided to pull the trigger and see if the reality of the Watch lived up the usefulness I imagined it could have. 

Two weeks later to today, I feel like I really made the right choice. 

The health features are mostly a novelty to me, but they may see more use as time goes on. 

The big winner for me is all my notifications being mirrored from my phone so I never miss anything. This might not be critical for everyone, but with two young kids this is a lifesaver. Saving a few seconds countless times a day and not needing to fumble my phone out so often really adds up. 

Having selectable little bits of data on the watch face is also saving a lot of time throughout the day. 

Siri/voice dictation on your wrist is more useful than you might imagine. I can have short text exchanges while walking on the street without slowing down to get my phone out and queue commands to the phone without touching the phone. 

Haptic feedback on your wrist makes reminders, alarms and Maps driving directions much less intrusive while at the same time being much more reliable. I don‚Äôt miss turns when my watch taps my wrist but I can keep the audio on my phone off so it doesn‚Äôt bother everybody else in the car.",watch face,positive

That seems like a standard notification from an app - android allows apps to push custom notifications with multiple pages, custom graphics, customizable hot areas and quick actions. 

For example, [LevelUp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scvngr.levelup.app&hl=en), a payment/rewards application that restaurants in my area use, has an android wear interface to their app.  Whenever I arrive at a restaurant that I've used LevelUp to pay at before (automatically detected with custom geofencing),  a notification shows up on my watch asking if I want to use LevelUp to pay. Like [this](https://lh4.ggpht.com/xGzv2rfktNHEHnGBhHioE0QiUa8HN5CDV0GuyZHlptPzjSNtz5Ba7OT0HZ13ccZz1kk=h900-rw#.png) I can slide it to the left and [choose the tip I want to include in the payment](https://lh5.ggpht.com/5cElkEmpBEPVwpLi2fJ8JrpGnTtl2SricZypSpaeIfS95xthN46QAS27lV3Whn5Kxw=h900-rw#.png) 

I also get notifications towards the end of the day if I haven't met my exercise goals in google fit, with a custom circular graph showing what I've done and how much more I need to do.

I also get notifications about any music or movies that's playing on my phone or my chromecast, with album art as the background and buttons to play/pause/skip forward back right on the watch.

And Apple's system has two advantages over standard quick release bands, other than locking you into an ecosystem.

Same as above. We can design our own watchfaces with multiple very powerful apps, including all kinds of fluid full screen animation, complications and such. The Playstore as well as those watchfaces designers are full of very quality watchfaces. This is again a clear advantage for Wear OS.

431,"Never used a wear OS watch. I have used the galaxy watch and watch active 2. I wouldn‚Äôt say the watch active 2 was years behind my Apple Watch series 6. 

The active 2 was fluid and fast enough. 

Bixby wasn‚Äôt great on the watch but I downloaded a third party Google assistant app. It worked well enough. I would hope that the Google assistant comes to the watch 4 in time. 

Samsung have more watch faces but Apple‚Äôs watch faces have better complications. For example on the watch face I have now I have 2 pictures of my children, a complication to control my Apple TV and a complication to control playback on my homepods. I didn‚Äôt see an option for that on the Samsung watch. The complications were largely determined by the watch face developer. On the Apple Watch you can basically have a complication for any app you have installed on the watch. However what I will say is that the complications had improved from the galaxy watch to the active 2. It had a lot of basic complications like fitness, health measurements, time, weather, date etc 

In terms of health sensors the watch 4 is now ahead of the Apple Watch. It can do pulse, o2 saturation, ECG, blood pressure and BIA. 

Samsung pay works well enough. Notifications came through as expected.

Native sleep tracking was better on the Samsung watch. Although I‚Äôm using a very good third party one on the Apple Watch. 


I think it comes down to how you use your watch. 

I use mine for notifications, very light fitness tracking, setting reminders, sleep tracking, flashlight, responding to messages, triaging phone calls, Apple Pay. 

Most of this I could do on a Samsung watch. The things the Samsung watch doesn‚Äôt do that I also use on my Apple Watch is:

Being able to control my Apple TV‚Äôs from my watch 

Being able to control my homepods from my watch. 

As far as I know there is no way at present to control a chromecast or Google home speakers from a Samsung watch. However this might change now that it runs wear OS. 

I personally don‚Äôt use music playback on my Apple Watch. However this is better on the Apple Watch. It also had more space for off line storage and you can also store audiobooks and podcasts. 

If you‚Äôre big into fitness which I am not lol then fitness + is superior as it links in with your Apple Watch as you are doing workouts and gives you real time feedback on your Apple TV.

Nice watch face, sucks that it does not give athlete metrics for the price",watch face,negative
436,"The problem with people stating it is still cheaper to pay 3+ apps to get good metrics out of it, is with all possible respect stupid.

All the data is there, you need to make sense of it anyways, you know why people prefer a good all around metric?

So they don‚Äôt have to make sense of all the things involved to get such metric.

I know for a fact that any sport watches use resting HR, HRV and some sort of extra calculated strain, whether it is time spent in 4+ HR zones, or HRV decline through the day, you can try and built something even in the shortcuts, but without the science behind it, like polar, garmin, sunto, and so many other options.

It does not make sense, you will lack most of the science behind them, and more likely even the context.

So yeah, Apple Watch does not compare by any means.

Sports oriented devices are not that much expensive, AW costs almost the same as some of the top end forerunner, or vantage line up, those will have software support for at least 2-3 active years, and most of those devices will last 4 years without any issues.

Does that make AW a bad device?

Not by any means, in fact AW since series 4 are the best Wrist HR based devices out there, matching almost perfectly a Polar H10, the fact that they don‚Äôt give you any useful metrics just sucks, they have the data, and its accurate to a 98+% when compared against a chest strap .

The fact that you have a lot of apps that claim to give you those useful metrics without any scientific background just makes the point worse. 

The watchface you shared is a living example of that, with the same data Athlytic app is telling me that im ready to go all in, but the training today is telling me, listen if you go higher than HR zone 3 you‚Äôre gonna be fucked up...

438,"You seem to have jumped to a few incorrect assumptions, so let me clarify. 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm completely device agnostic. Currently wearing Apple Watch 6 (and 4 if the 6 is charging) and a Polar Grit X. Adding Garmin 955 assuming my hunch is right and it‚Äôs announced in a few weeks. 

‚Ä¢ I never said the Watch is better than, or on par with, a top end dedicated sports watch. But it‚Äôs better than people who review it based only on default apps/software give it credit for. Since this sub is an Apple Watch sub it seems appropriate to restrict my discussion/posts to that device. 

‚Ä¢ The watchfaces as pictured in this post are using generic sample data in complications, so commenting on discrepancies between non-existent data is a waste of your time. 

‚Ä¢  Neither of us are in a position to claim whether or not these apps incorporate peer-reviewed science in how they analyze the raw health data. I can say that when testing Training Today vs Garmin‚Äôs Body Battery (using an old Vivoactive 4, so admittedly not the best oHRM) for a month the two were consistently in agreement. I probably should take a month to correlate the watch apps vs Polar‚Äôs ANS recovery score but since leaving academia I‚Äôm way less passionate about random poking at data. 

I appreciate how much you seem to care about wearables and quantified self data.",watch face,positive

448,"Agreed 99%. But someone spending this much money on a watch is doing it obviously because they can, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they want to as well.

463,">you can't even add custom face watches. For a product that is supposed to be very personal this is ridiculous.

Have patience. Apple has *always* been conservative, restricting as much as is feasible and then relaxing those restrictions as time passes and (importantly) APIs are refined and tested. They also err on the side of a good user experience over customisability - and on a device with a tiny battery and an OLED screen, custom watch faces are a definite user experience hit.

It is easier for them to grant more freedoms later than take them away, and this is how they have been operating since the iPhone in 2007. The lack of third party watch faces is not unusual, likely not permanent and should not be a surprise. It is certainly not ridiculous after less than a month after the watch was released.

I, myself, are waiting for third party complications, but I am happy to let them finalise the API before allowing them.",watch face,positive

466,"They're two different design mentalities. Android's design mentality is (and always has been) to give users all of the options so they can make their own choices, even if some of those are bad. Apple's design philosophy is to limit the choices to a small set of heavily designed and vetted options, but if you don't like what you see than you're SOL.

So, do you want choice or curation?

It sounds like you want choice. It's no surprise, then, that you prefer android products.

I personally, want curation. Because I have no interest in digging through piles and piles of bad designs just to get to the one I want. Apple is great for me.

Your opinion is that Apple should have more watch faces, and you use your personalized watch face as an example of why it's good. I look at your watch face and think it looks tacky (I don't want a Goldeneye reference on my wrist), and I see why Apple took the approach they did.",watch face,positive

474,That looks great. Thank you. I have one more question.. have you tried on different watch faces on the red? Do they seem unfit if the colours don‚Äôt match the redness of the watch? For example - the contour face with numbers in yellow. I want to go for red but am hesitant because of its versatility.,watch face,negative
