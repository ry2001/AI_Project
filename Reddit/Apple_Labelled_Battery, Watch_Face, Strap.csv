0,I am glad Apple Watch retained the round design. While a redesign could be interesting the current shape lends itself to comfort for all day wear. I was just at the gym a noticed how often my wrists pushed the watch but didn’t mess with my workout because of the round edges.,Others
1,"It seems like most people who already have an AW are unimpressed by this update, but as somebody who is getting a series 7 as their first smart watch, can I just say I’m hype as hell for the fast charging and no bezels? I don’t even mind the colors that much, I went with midnight and I think it looks great",Others
2,As someone who has a series 1 I’m definitely pumped! All of the reviews downplay it I think because the reviewers are techies that get review units each year. I will acknowledge I’m behind and it’s me that hasn’t updated. But I feel like we’re caught up in update culture. Where yes they could add more health features and a few more things but also the changes are so incremental because it’s such a good device in the first place.,Others
3,"I imagine the space gray aluminum was the single most popular Apple Watch model. Getting rid of it was a pretty naked attempt at trying to force people into a SS or titanium, but I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out.",Others
4,"Basically, it’s Apple Watch Series 6s?",Others
5,Oh man does the green look great. It's a very dark almost army green and looks stunning in the videos. Incredibly happy I went with that over midnight (which looks black with a slight blue at certain angles in direct sunlight).,Others
6,I'm still using Apple Watch 4. No motivation to buy that one. I will wait for a better update.,Others
7,"I will say, seeing videos of the watches in natural light does help - the starlight looks about like how I expected in that champagne kind of color and the midnight and green are both a lot darker than I expected which is a pleasant surprise.",Others
8,"Based on the videos, the midnight looks pretty black at first glance. You see the blue if you look at it carefully/in the right light. Might look different in person.",Others
9,The keyboard is the seller for me,Others
10,"I watched a couple of reviews and cancelled my preorder. Seeing it in real videos now, even with the thinner bezels it still just looks like the same watch which I’ve never loved the design of. My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign, but I still decided to put an order in. But the lack of neutral colours on lower end bands forced me to go for the milanese loop along with the stainless steel to get something I liked the look of, and at that price it simply isn’t worth it for me. I’ll wait for the series 8 to see if it has the new design and neutral bands.",Others
11,"If you have a Series 3 like me and were considering upgrading because of dreadful performance…. I strongly recommend installing watchOS 8.0.1 before ordering a new watch. 

It’s a major performance improvement and I’m now thinking of hanging on to this S3 for a little longer.",Others
12,Waiting for another 38mm model. Or 36 w a full screen. These are just too bulky.,Others
13,"Anyone who says this is an “S” year really doesn’t get how S models work.

The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is the literal opposite of an S year.",Others
14,Even with these minor updates since last 2-3 years. AW is the best smartwatch and there is nothing even close. Shows you how other companies are far behind in the competition.,Battery
15,I wonder if it still works with the Belkin 3-in-1 Magsafe dock,Others
16,I have a space gray S4. I was considering going to the S7 but no way am I paying for $800 for Space Black Titanium. Tim Apple has let me down on this one,Others
17,"As an owner of a Series 6 Nike Edition watch, I'll be holding out for the future release that includes a blood glucose sensor.      With the cost of the sensors that you can wear for 14 days of continuous blood glucose monitoring, the Apple Watch series that does that feature will be well worth the upgrade.",Others
18,"It's bizarre to me how much complaining there is about the Starlight and Midnight color options in this thread for a few reasons:

1) They're still super close to Silver and Space Grey. A hint of gold or blue does not make them ""not neutral,"" and anybody who isn't up on Apple color conventions is still going to look at them and think they look silver or dark grey. 

2) Why does it matter if they're neutral in the first place? You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. No, the Space Black Ti model is not going to look more professional/less gadgety than the Midnight Al.",Others
19,Did anybody get the Gold SS (or any SS) review models?,Others
20,"This is the 2nd apple device that I may upgrade too only because I regret my previous purchase. 


I got the iPhone 13 pro only because I regret getting the iPhone 12 with no telephoto lens, and I might get the series 7 only because I regret getting the SE with no always on display. Neither seem like enticing options if I made the correct choice with the 12 pro/series 6 last year.",Others
21,so the s7 SiP is the same as the s6 SiP???,Others
22,"I ordered one because It’s more trouble to buy a cheaper 6 from going to another country rather than get the 7 delivered to my door. 

First AW btw. I’ve only used it briefly for a week because a friend borrowed it to me so I can get a reference to compare it to the gwa2 I had.",Others
23,I’m excited for my watch coming this Friday. Going to be upgrading from a Series 1!,Others
24,Have a stainless with Milanese loop 45mm coming as my first Apple Watch. I’m very excited!! I don’t know too much about the features which makes me even more excited!,Others
25,My new 7 is taking forever to charge and doesn’t hold a charge.  What chargers is everyone using and how long to charge?  15 mins?!  I wish!,Others
26,So that whole announcement about it having really durable crystal across the board was a lie and it’s just glass and crystal on the stainless still?,Others
27,"Well the hands on real world footage has shown clearly what I was worried about

The screen going so far edge to edge with such a curvy bit of glass looks weird

Looks to me like the screen is too big for the watch. The way the reflective edge obscures the display just doesn’t look all that great

The display no longer looks like its on top of the glass, it looks like its trapped behind the glass

And now I’m convinced that this will look great with a flatter redesign that I suspect we will get next year (if it wasn’t originally planned for this year)",Others
28,"I mean just get a Series 6 which will probably discounted by retailers or off eBay. I got a series 5 stainless steel in January, heavily discounted and can see myself holding onto this for a while",Others
29,"Yeh I also thought this with the “leaked” design, them squared edges don’t look like they’ll be too nice when bending my wrist. And yes before anyone mentions it, I know traditional, analog can watches have squared edges and are bulky",Others
30,This is a good summary. That’s…basically it for changes.,Others
31,"Coming from a wifi only Series 4, it’s a slightly better upgrade to the 7 cellular. Other than going for walks without my phone with me now, I doubt I’m going to be using it any differently.",Others
32,Since when aren’t black and silver neutral colours?,Others
33,"You’re definitely part of the target audience for the Series 7. I think people forget that for anyone thinking about upgrading from a Series 4 or older, this is a pretty significant upgrade.",Others
34,Exactly the same here!,Others
35,Same here! My first one. I'm only bummed by the removing of space grey color but i'll live with the midnight,Others
36,"Very excited here as well! I am upgrading from an OG Galaxy Watch. I was a recent Android convert, and this will be my first Apple Watch. 

Looking forward to the integration and overall polish, as that was dearly lacking on the OG Galaxy Watch.",Others
37,"I’m excited for mine, finally broke my series 2 a couple weeks ago",Others
38,"It's just like phones - it's an incremental upgrade from the previous generation, but it's really aimed at people who haven't upgraded for 2+ years.  For them, it's a large jump.",Others
39,I mean I’m hyped as well upgrading from a Series 0 lmao…,Others
40,"Yeah, I'm digging that midnight. Waiting for mine to arrive.

Up to everyone's taste 🤷🏻‍♂️",Others
41,"Same here, I think all the people with recent watches are missing the point. The tech is mature enough that upgrading every year or two is pointless and wasteful.",Others
42,You should see the screenshots and texts between me and my buddy.  We are very excited for midnight,Others
43,Basically the Verge’s video conclusion lmao.,Others
44,I’ll be coming form a S4. So there’s some new shit for me.,Others
45,Your hype is totally justified! I jumped on the AW train last year with the S6 which was similarly received and I felt just as you described. I hope you love your new S7!,Others
46,I wonder if they’ll also phase out silver and space grey on the new MacBooks (in favour of Starlight and Midnight). Currently I don’t think any of the recently refreshed products have any silver/space grey aluminum which is a bit odd.,Others
47,"Removing neutral colors (black and white) from the base iPhone 13 lineup this year didn’t seem to slow down sales, even though they were probably the most popular colors.",Others
48,"I’m sure they’ve calculated these losses go one they didn’t even need to build a new chipset. This, internally, is the same processor then the S6. That’s where most of the money in R&D goes, and they didn’t need to spend a single dollar this year on making it better.",Others
49,"The only reason I bought a model other than the aluminum was for the sapphire screen. In hindsight, it was worth it, but I wish they would let all models have the sapphire rather than just the premium",Others
50,"> I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out  

Yeah right now I'm waiting to see if any S6 deals are on the go (UK) or go cheapsies on the SE. Was more than happy to go in on the big new thing but what a jip.  

Edit: None have seemingly dropped from the current price that I've seen yet but likely will once they get S7 stock...",Others
51,"Of the three people who I know who have apple watches, they’re all getting midnight and are excited after todays pics and videos",Others
52,I doubt it. Some of these colors are REALLY neutral. Heck apparently the very green one is more or less gray in anything but ideal lighting.,Others
53,Don’t think apple will ever bring space Grey back for any of their products. It’ll be more of graphite. A darker shade. I’ll expect MacBook Pro to follow suit. Basically all of the pro products will have similar colour range. AW SS imo falls under the pro range,Others
54,This is definitely one of the Apple Watches ever released,Others
55,"Ehh I'd only expect spec bumps for an S. 20% larger screen, faster charging but no spec bump is... it's own minor thing.",Others
56,and it's not like the Series 6 was anything more than a Series 5 with a gimmicky Spo2 sensor.,Others
57,"Same here. I can’t figure out why the green isn’t more popular. I got the clover solo loop but man, the black bands paired with the green watch sure look great.",Others
58,"I wasn’t complaining, I missed preorder by far, but green was still available for day 1 store pickup by midday.",Others
59,What’s the battery health on your S4?,Battery
60,I’m definitely getting the series 8 if my watch makes it to then.,Others
61,I broke my Apple Watch 4 a couple months ago and have no motivation to buy this. The incremental watch updates are killing me.,Others
62,"I’m totally happy with the physical design of it, but there’s nothing this year that makes it a worthwhile upgrade. For me, the two biggest things that I’d be excited for are either a significant upgrade to battery life, or some new health-tracking features enabled by new hardware. Anything else is kinda “well I guess a slightly larger screen is nice but not $400 nice”.",Others
63,"> My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign

I just cannot understand the logic behind wanting redesigns on things just for the sake of having them redesigned... It's a smart watch with an extremely limited form factor, what are you expecting? Will square sides chuff your bits?",Others
64,Hard edge Apple Watch would suck for working out / sports,Others
65,"Same, cancelled and ordered couple new bands instead to clench that consumer thirst",Others
66,"Same. When this was announced I was all in. Then as time went on, the shiny idea went away and my s3 still does what I need and doesn’t cost me $800. Gonna use that to replace my aging iMac",Others
67,Yeah I agree. I cleared everything and installed 8.0.1 and it feels like a new watch somehow. I’m still going to check out my ss series 7 when it comes in for a week then make my decision.,Others
68,"> The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is not the official definition though. And no one is calling it the ""S"" model like it is an official thing. 

> This is the literal opposite of an S year.

The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature. None of those really apply here.",Others
69,“ but I need something new and drastic every year!!!!!!”,Others
70,I think all of us that use an analog watch face agree that its ridiculous that we don't have 120Hz or higher yet. Watching the second hand move on my current Apple watch only compels me to stab my eyes out with an Apple Pencil.,Others
71,"If you’re able to, couldn’t you get a Series 6? I just got one, it’s a great device and one that could last me a few generations. I imagine the series 6 will do the same for you.",Others
72,">It also doesn’t help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS

From what I've seen the reviews, Midnight honestly [looks closer to black](https://i.redd.it/xc3cprrt19t71.jpg) than Space Gray ever did. It has a slight blue sheen in certain lighting, but it's super subtle to the point where black bands match it better than the Midnight ones.

It's almost making me regret getting black Ti, but I still think that also looks great so I'm going to keep it for now.",Others
73,I mean the “graphite” stainless steel model seems pretty black to me,Others
74,…so get aluminum…?,Others
75,">	Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like.

The colour that I like is no longer available. That’s the problem.",Others
76,"I think this is just all wild speculative whining driven by the absence of being able to hold a watch in your hand and having to go by product images online. As soon as they're released, I expect very few actual complaints in real world use.

I've been a participant in this before: When every Apple 'news' site broadcasted that the MagSafe Duo was possibly incompatible with the iPhone 13 Pro I was aghast and fretting over it. Only to receive the phone and charge it every night on it without any issue. Not exactly the same, but its no point in getting so worked up over something until you actually have it in your hand.",Others
77,It looks like everyone has been getting the green one for their reviews so far.,Others
78,"Yep, 7 only",Others
79,The sapphire is more scratch resistant but also heavier and more brittle (prone to shattering). The ion-glass is much better for the “sports/fitness” model.,Others
80,"I know it adds a little bulk, but the there are so many bumper styles out for for super cheap.  I’d highly recommend; they’ve saved my A3 on dozens of occasions.",Others
81,"I agree it looked that way, but if you take a close look at the watch when it's on your wrist, it's really the sensor on the bottom that has contact on your skin, not the edges of the watch. In fact, short of bending my wrist straight up, I can't even get myself to contact the sides.  That's just to say that I think the more angular design wouldn't be an issue in practice.",Others
82,"Oh if you have a series 3 there’s no question you should upgrade. 

Also Tommy rules!",Others
83,"He did address battery life, it’s the same.",Battery
84,He mentions battery life in the video.,Battery
85,"he addressed on battery and recharge 

while battery life is the same. quick charge fits his life style much better",Battery
86,"there's not anything new there really. battery life is the same as it's always been ('fine' to 'mediocre' depending on how you use the Watch), but it charges faster so you can just do a quick charge at night or in the morning if you find some benefit to sleep tracking and be fine.",Battery
87,Also watch your bands. I used a sports band and jumped off a rock about 10 feet up and lost my watch on impact (on the second jump). The river was not clear and it was lost forever.,Others
88,There is no black aluminum. The midnight version has a blue tint to it.,Others

92,Same I’m excited - also getting my first cellular model,Others
93,"Oddly, the new iPad mini has Starlight and Space Grey.",Others
94,"I doubt they'd do that. Maybe we'll see MacBooks come in color options similar to the iMacs, but I don't think they're going to release new colorways to match watches. The watch is unique among Apple offerings because it's a fashion accessory as much as it is a tech product. The people who think all Apple products should be color-matched are looking at it the wrong way, imo. The watches need to be matched with clothing, not MacBooks.",Others
95,"At least you can (and most likely do) put a cover on a phone, with the watch you're stuck with what you've got.",Others
96,"For me the color matters much more for a watch than a phone. You’re likely not putting a case on it, and it’s part of your outfit.",Others
97,I’n from NL and found a 40mm Series 6 on Amazon for 299 a few weeks ago. That was enough reason for me the take the S6 and not wait for the S7. Best choice ever after seeing these reviews.,Others
98,"4s^3 is impossible, it should be 4s^2 3d^1",Others
99,">I can’t figure out why the green isn’t more popular

The answer to the question ""Why isn't x color more popular"" when it comes to fashion accessories is pretty simple. Most colors outside of black, white, gold, and brown just don't go together nicely with most people's clothing choices, and this green color on the Series 7 looks like it unfortunately falls into that camp.

Never mind the fact that conventional mechanical watches are almost always found in those colors as well.",Others
100,"I went in 50/50 between green and midnight but I ended up looking in my closet to make up my mind. The green would work with my weekend clothes but it’s just not right for my black, blue, and gray heavy business attire, and (rather unfortunately) I’m in the business clothes many more hours than my casual clothes during the Monday through Friday time period when I’ll actually need to use a watch. Still would have preferred graphite to match my 13 Pro but I’m staying open minded about the midnight.",Others
101,My S4 that I got replaced in Feb 2019 is at 85%,Others
102,How about 400 minus what you get from selling your 6 ?,Others
103,I’m with you.  Plus I don’t want a mini iPhone looking thing on my wrist.  The current Apple Watch looks amazing and does not need a redesign,Others
104,"It’s important to me that it looks good, and for me the rumoured redesign was a significant aesthetic improvement over the current design.",Others
105,"I’m on an s4 so I have those, and yeah, totally minor things. The only reason I’m even entertaining updating is I’ve been dying for the always on screen, and my watch is getting fairly beat up after years of daily use… but I don’t like the colors of the aluminum and would never go to the stainless, and the idea of buying last years product when it’s still so expensive just seems wrong to me.

I really wanted to upgrade, but everything about this watch feels like a minor revision, and that they plan for something much more significant next year. And if not, well, we’ll see…",Others
106,">The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature.

TouchID was a pretty valuable feature. And as far as redesigns go, it's S7 is probably more substantial than going from iPhone 6S to 7 was. Same with XS to 11.",Others
107,"Not saying it’s a definition, but that’s always how S models worked.

3GS identical to 3G
4S identical to 4
5s near identical to 5, with home button changed for Touch ID 
6s identical to 6
XS identical to X

It would make more sense to call the S6 “Series 5s” than to call Series 7 a “Series 6s”",Others
108,"Gotcha, thanks! It wasn’t listed underneath the dock’s compatibility section on Belkin’s website and I saw a post on here a few weeks ago inquiring the same thing",Others
109,Did they replace the screen too when you got the battery replaced or have you just taken really good care of yours? I'm debating cancelling my order but the scratch in my series 4 has been bothering me for a couple years now and going to the sapphire glass would be nice.,Battery

But on the other hand. All the excitement behind the last 5 updates all come at once now so I’m still pretty hyped!

- Pay $450 for an Stainless Steel Apple Watch (Series 6)

If I'm spending $450 for the upgrade, I might as well just go for the premium material if I don't care for the Series 7.",Others
154,"Yeah, they don’t repair watches. They just replace them.",Others
155,">for me it’s the perfect size and fit.

The size and fit hasn't really changed much with S7 (only by 1mm). I was referring to the extra room for text and revamped UI from the new version as being a benefit. Not the larger physical size.",Others
156,"Kind of disingenuous on Apple’s behalf here, the spacing on the words and letters is completely different between the two.",Others
157,Looks grey to me my dude,Others
158,On your Apple Watch go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health.,Battery
159,But those aren’t on your wrist.   Wasn’t a big complaint of the Apple Watch being that it wasn’t a circle?,Others
160,">No, my priorities are valuable features. Fast charging and 20% larger screen aren't a priority for me

That's... exactly what I just said above - that the outer material of the watch is more of a priority than fast charging and the larger screen w/ a revamped UI. I was mostly just curious.

>I'm ready to drop $450 for an upgrade. I could either:Pay $450 for an Aluminum Apple Watch (Series 7) orPay $450 for an Stainless Steel Apple Watch (Series 6)

Fair enough! Worth mentioning that one of these options is used though and probably won't come with the same warranty and might not be in the same condition or have the same battery health. But I do agree that buying used previous-gen electronics will get generally be a better value than buying something that just came out.",Others
161,"yes i’m speaking about the screen size, sorry if I wasn’t clear",Others
162,The case size hasn't changed much for the 45mm it only got a mm taller. The 41mm case is a mm taller and wider.,Others
163,"I believe that's just how it looks on a 40mm screen - the longer words are forced down to the next line because there isn't enough room in the right margin to fit them. It does seem like they could make the whole text bubble wider though, on both models.",Others
164,">The same keyboard Apple stole from a third party developer?

I guess? Seems like it would be hard to know if Apple had been working on their own keyboard or if they literally just ""stole"" one. I do agree that it was a dick move to force them to delist that app though.

Also not sure what that has to do with if the Series 7 is worth it or not.

EDIT: Funny that this is such a controversial comment.  I'm not even saying they didn't steal it - it just seems like this sort of thing requires proof to be certain.  And do people really believe that Apple *wasn't* ever working on their own watch keyboard all these years?",Others
165,...what? How did you stray even further from the actual color? lol,Others
166,Oh duh - same way you check the phone haha. Thank you. Also I got mine day 1 and it’s also 81%,Others
167,A circle would be even better. But flat edges on the current design would be better than what we have now IMO.,Others
168,"Nah ignore the text bubble, look at the spacing between lines of text, it’s much tighter on the S7",Others
169,Mines 79. I’ve decided to get the new watch mainly because of the AoD.,Others
170,"Ah, I see what you mean. But I'm not sure if that's disingenuous unless it's a doctored photo and not how it actually appears. It does seem like they could reduce that on the S6 though, assuming it is accurate.",Others
171,Just to clarify: you think the midnight color looks grey? First you said it was black and now grey? What is going on,Others
172,"Apple hasn’t made a actually black anything in a while. It’s always grey. They made a jet black iPhone 7 but that’s pretty much it. It’s been space grey, graphite or midnight. All slightly different shades of grey. Calling it black is just easier.",Others
173,"Okay but I feel like we're drifting away from the point of this: midnight is not black, nor grey.",Others
174,It’s grey. Ask most people and they’ll say grey,Others

184,"IMO, Apple Watch is always the recommendation in general just like the iPad, especially when it’s health related. But, if you’re looking for a budget Apple Watch, you can buy one of Apple’s previous generation models for $200. I gotta say that Apple last much longer than other watch brands out there because of the software support even if it means the price, you get what you pay for. I’m still using Series 3 GPS and it still runs like brand new.",Others
185,"I ordered this and the SE phone because it was the lowest point of entry to get my grandfather that fall detection feature.

186,"I just picked up the SE as I can't justify the significant extra cost for O2 sensor that shows questionable results, an always-on screen (don't need to have the screen on when I'm not looking at my watch), and a U1 chip that currently has zero value.  The watch is a nice upgrade from my series 3.  Still won't replace my Garmin Fenix 5S for serious hikes (6+ hours) as activity tracking for that long crushes the battery.",Others
187,"I’d rather upgrade from an S3 to an S5 instead of an SE tbch. Isn’t there the ECG on the 5? Bc if there is, I had a heart condition. Was ablated but still a possibility to come back. I’d rather fork up the extra $100-200 to kinda see if I don’t have it come back",Others
188,Anyone on the fence I can honestly say my Apple Watch is one of my favorite purchases in a while. I didn’t think I’d use it as much as I do but just the little things like being able to find your phone or control music from your phone is something I really like. I also love the fitness features and use it to track my runs and listen to music since I don’t bring my phone. It sounds small but I can say I love having it.,Others

258,"I get that but if your worried about money, as I assume someone buying the cheapest option would be, than not having an always on display only saves you money by making the battery have a longer lifespan.

333,Stop thinking of it as a watch. It’s clearly much more than that. You don’t need some fancy chronometer to last 50 years either. Any cheap Casio will likely still be working fine in 50 years.,Others
334,"My 15$ Casio works for 10 years without a battery replacement and has functions and accuracy which a high end mechanical chronometer will not have.


A high end chronometer is *never* bought to keep time in these times. It's main function is being a status symbol for people who value that. And also as a fashion accessory... If those two things were irrelevant to the owners of such clocks, an inexpensive quartz digital clock is far superior.

And I also have some *better* mechanical watches, but the casio is my ""daily"" watch I wear everywhere and the mechanical watches are for more formal occasions (where I guess I show off my wealth? ): ).


The Apple watch is a bit of both, because it definitely does offer high tech functionality no classic or digital watch ever could, and it is also definitely used as a status symbol.",Others

337, If it does turn out to be a software lock the developers in r/tweakbounty and r/jailbreak will probably come up with something.,Others
338,They have identical screens but aren't the guts basically a Series 4? That watch didn't have an always on display either. So maybe it's not the screen that's the limiting factor.,Others
339,"Not really. The Series 6 (and last year’s Series 5) have a little bit of extra tech in the displays that allow for the display to downclock to as low as 1 frame per second instead of running at the conventional 60 fps. If they left the screen on at 60 fps all the time, the watch’s battery would be dead within only a few hours.",Others
340,"Is it really? That's kinda a dick move, I always thought that the SE just has a cheaper screen than the S6.",Others
341,The SE would have the same always on brightness as the S5 because they have the same chip (half as bright as the 6). Tbh I bet someone could jailbreak that into watch OS for the SE.,Others
342,"There could be different chip binning, missing chip features and a cheaper battery. A tear down will tell us the truth but it’s all speculation now.",Battery
343,"Is it identical?  Because Apple built some low power tech into the Series 5 to have it be always on, maybe they’re using the screens from Series 4?",Others
344,"Kind of like Tesla vehicles.  Everything is there under the $30k car, you just need to spend $10,000 more to unlock the battery in order to go 100 miles more.",Others
345,"If that’s true, could jailbreak enable it?",Others
346,"It’s not just software, there’s some sort of chip in the S5 and 6 that locks the frame rate to 1fps while the screen is dimmed in always on mode. But that’s the most important factor in a smart watch to me so sadly I can’t imagine buying an SE.",Others
347,">Which is honestly really stupid since the S6 and SE have identical screens. It’s just software locked.

Isn't this a big part of how they make money. You know, pursuade their consumers to buy yet another iteration of something that already exists?",Others
348,"Functionality wise? Sure. But anesthetics are a major reason smartwatches finally took off. Sadly, a lot of people couldn't care less about 2 weeks battery on a watch if the screen looks as unappealing as a sticker.",Others

It’s supposed to be a premium watch, it’s gonna have good screen. More fitness-only watches can get away with darker screens.",Others

351,Apple has always been really good at [price anchoring](http://changingminds.org/disciplines/marketing/pricing/price_anchoring.htm).,Others
352,"I think that’s the thing, they priced it so close to the 6 to encourage people to get the 6 instead. If I didn’t buy the 3 last November, I’d have got the 6 tbh",Others
353,"Is it actually? I've been thinking about getting an Apple watch for a few months now, so I'm curious why the aod is a big deal. Doesn't the display light up right when you raise your wrist, or is there a lag or something?",Others
354,Got a s5 with LTE off eBay for 350 ... 44 size about 4 months ago,Others
355,I actually got it specifically because it DIDNT have AOD. I have two little kids and they become infatuated with my watch if the display lights up. SE was the perfect upgrade from my very battered S3 and I’ve been loving it.,Others
356,"I’m saving up $400 for the Series 7, but when that comes out I’ll probably find myself in the same boat, willing to settle for the Series 6 for cheaper, or really the Series 5 for the AOD. I love that I was able to get the Series 2 from my friend for $100 used, but I’m ready for the upgrade. So anyway, $400 is a lot to pay, and I don’t do payments on stuff like that, so I’m saving an extra $35 monthly at the moment by taking 30 minute lunch breaks (instead of my comfortable hour-long ones) and clocking in, and hopping to a few minutes early.",Others
357,the fact that you need to raise your arm and have that little delay is reallyyyyyyyyyy annoying. i bet they tested this over and over to make sure it's true and feature locked it. i got other watches without always on display and i absolutely can't use it as a watch. it drives me crazy.,Others
358,No not particularly. Low light OLED’s can be incredibly efficient. Most of the power consumption is not from displaying stuff but rather processing stuff using the cpu. White OLED’s are the most efficient anyway since it is a simple open channel without color processing. Power consumption is minimal,Others
359,"I think it also only turns on automatically if you enter that you are older than a certain age (e.g. 65... not sure exactly), otherwise you need to turn it on in the settings.",Others

362,Ah the series 4 the one that was the first Apple Watch to have fall detection.,Others
363,Yeah I care more about my grandpa than the money I give to Apple.,Others
364,Same. I’ve had the SE for a week now and I’m really enjoying it,Others
365,"At this stage even if you don't need the extra features of an SE or higher, the S3 just doesn't have enough onboard storage. Every update requires you to wipe it, update then restore these days.",Others

369,That never really happens but if it did it’s not worth the price difference for the two times a year I may need it :),Others
370,"Fair points, nice that people have the choice now.  Everyone can evaluate if the feature difference is worth the cost.",Others
371,Google it.  People are showing watch results vs proper pulse oximiter results. The top of the wrist is a poor spot to measure O2 sat.,Others
372,Just go read any of the plethora of views. It's inconsistent and doesn't work at all half the time. It's also not medically certified. It's not medically accurate.,Others
373,I have a s5 and have the brightness on medium because high is too bright. I'm shocked anyone thinks it needs to be brighter. on high there's no privacy and when the environment is dark it makes me look like an idiot. there's no ambient sensor.,Others

I do watch my HR sometimes. Hell, it’s the middle part of my modular screen that I never get off of LOL.

But yea, it was a cryoblation, not a heat ablation so there’s like less that a 2% chance it comes back... and if I’m honest it probably would’ve come back by now and I would’ve noticed at least once lol.",Others

388,I think it’s an appropriate comparison since they are competing in the same space. If you want to be in the Android space don’t expect a decent watch unless you go Samsung.,Others
389,"I completely agree. I had to replace multiple fitbits, sometimes in as little as 6 months. My Series 1 Apple Watch has never given me a bit of  trouble and has a lot more features.",Others

I hardly use it if I’m not at work or running which to be honest I hardly do lol",Others
403,"For sure, there’s a lag. You get used to it. The “always on” feature (should be standard really) isn’t with an upgrade imo. And there’s not much you use your watch for anyway, yes there’s apps, but most need the phone nearby or activated by phone first, so it’s kind of redundant, just use the phone.

The Watch is fine, but at nearly $1000 (gps + cellular + additional watch bands + protector cases) you can get a good classic time piece that’ll hold it’s value better (Apple Watch/Android Watches lower in value so much faster) and likely has a better design (fashion) and character.",Others

In my country we have dedicated ‘Community Alarm’ service who install specialist equipment which links to a local social work office with staff dedicated to raising the alarm/attending to assist.

As for those without “heart problems”, the ekg may pick up a-fib in some patients. This can be problematic. In medicine, sometimes wide-spread screening isn’t always a good thing. If a one lead EKG shows a-fib in a seemingly healthy individual, that person would probably want to go get a work up.

Yeah Starlight is replacing Silver.

Edit: I watched a review video and the screen change is absolutely huge in my opinion. Coming from a 4 it is very tempting. I didn't think there was anything in 5/6 that was compelling enough to cause me to upgrade but this might.",Others

It’s 3 years old; to me, might as well upgrade rather than spend money on it replacing the battery. I also kind of figure that with the 7 technically being a complete case redesign (even though it largely looks the same) we aren’t going to see some wild redesign next year; Apple will probably want to use the new design for at least 2-3 years. Doesn’t really give me reason to wait another year.",Others

904,"Should be easy to fill up 10 minutes if the reviewer is actually ya know... reviewing the device. If the comparison to the S6 is the subject of the entire video then that reviewer is simply bad at their job. Catering to annual upgraders is ignoring the vast majority of their audience. The average shopper is either buying an Apple Watch for the first time or upgrading from a much older version. At most, the S6 comparison should be a one minute section of the review and the rest of the time should be spent showing off *all* the features of the S7, regardless if the same features have been available on the previous generation.",Others
905,"After a week you would think they would be able to tell you what differences in usage the improvement have made. I think it’s fine to compare it to the six but really and truly u shouldn’t have to upgrade a product every year anyway. I’m sure most of the people with the iPhone 12 Pro aren’t buying the iPhone 13 pro this year. Another reviewer pointed out earlier this week from Apple Watch 4-5 there were even less upgrades compared to what the 7 is getting. He also said the Apple Watch is now a mature product and we are not gonna see huge changes every year like we used to I agree with him, especially when the more complex health sensors are a few years out.",Others

And while watching reviews I've realized it's more silver than I thought 😅 I would agree with calling it champagne color. 

It's very nice but I kinda wish they would keep aluminum gold too... Nevertheless I already ordered what will match me more but I really think Starlight will be good option for people who like neutral, delicate colors.",Others
909,"Yeah, it's very nice color, just not for me but can see it working for many people! People complained that there is no neutral aluminum version but I think Starlight is pretty neutral.",Others
910,"I disagree, as soon as i saw it in the video i thought, boy that's blue and when they put the space grey next to it, it shows even more how much bluer it is. Black bands will on accentuate that. Glad I got Starlight.",Others
911,It will buy very blue if you go outside in sunny day,Others
912,Not on the aluminum versions.  Midnight is the closest to black but so far the images suggest it is more of a very dark blue vs the black/space gray of before.  You need to go up to the stainless steel or titanium to get space black or graphite.,Others
913,Not in aluminum,Others
914,That is correct,Others
915,The screen size from 4 to 5 is the same right? I could understand upgrading from a 4 because by then the battery is degrading and the watch is probably a little slow due to bulky WatchOS upgrades,Others
916,I’d agree but my ss5 battery has had it. I’m still thinking of a reduced price 6!,Battery
917,"The s3 to s4 was a 35% size increase in screen and a whole design change to rounded edges. The s6 to s7 is 20% increase in screen size with the same rounded edges. It’s nice, but It isn’t as big of a difference in any way",Others

I'm in the same boat. I'm not sure I'd call the battery terrible on mine but it's bad enough that I've started to notice.

So it sounds like people aren't saying *not* to upgrade to the 7, which is nice.",Battery
928,are people avoiding the 5/6 because it is a ‘slightly better 4’ (aka not a worthy upgrade) or there is something wrong with those models?,Others

930,I’ve had a Fitbit for a long time. You adjust to it.,Others
931,3 —> 4 —> 5 —> were all significant jumps in some way. 6 and 7 were iterative. I’m happy with my 5 and only upgrading to the 7 because my wife wants to. I’ll enjoy The upgrade but don’t expect to be blown away.,Others

935,"Showering isn't new though. This Apple support article is out of date but still states: 

>Showering with Apple Watch Series 2 and newer is ok, but we recommend not exposing Apple Watch to soaps, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, and perfumes as they can negatively affect water seals and acoustic membranes.

But the reviews makes you think you are getting a DSLR/mirrorless inside a phone....

I have the Apple Watch 6 and I have no plans upgrading anytime soon, but I would like to buy one as a gift to a family member, and I am debating with myself which model (6/SE/7).... and these reviews don't help at all, I really consider them fake reviews from people who want to be on Apple's influencer list.",Others

I go SS because of that scratch resistance, but the majority get aluminium, and I imagine most will want a proper black watch.",Others
941,That’s where I am at. My four is just fine so I am in zero rush.,Others
942,Yep. The four is still lightning fast and is as fast as a 5/6 for everyday tasks. Perhaps some third party apps  take advantage of whatever processing differences there are but built in stuff doesn’t seem to.,Others
943,"I never even knew the SS watches got different glass!  I've never managed to scratch the glass on my aluminum ones though and it looks like the series 7 aluminum this year gets some new ION-X crystal glass, but the SS do get sapphire.",Others
944,"It looks the same, it is physically different though; it is slightly taller for one. I would assume Apple would want some economies of scale out of this before making another physical change as such. But I could be wrong.",Others
945,"They are snappier tho, I’ve noticed it with the series 6. Day to day it doesn’t bother me, but if I mess around with a 6 for a bit, I notice the slightly slower performance. The difference is small, but on a device like this, the slightest annoyance or lag can make you not use it and go to your phone. That was the best part of going from a Series 0 to the 4, the screen was definitely nicer, but it was the snappiness that made it more pleasant to use.

Edit: to clarify I have a 4 currently",Others
946,I’m thinking the same.,Others
947,"> Totally expect next years model to take the iphone route (hard edges) 

Why would people want hard edges on a watch though? Unless they figure out how to make it much thinner, I guess. Otherwise, give me the contours.",Others
948,"Apple’s site says $79. I mean all things said it’s not really a lot, I just don’t like spending that kind of money on something I can probably only sell for at most twice that. Personal preference really.",Others
949,"The always-on screen from the 5, blood oxygen  sensor from the 6 are the big ones off the top of my head. More storage I think started with the 5 (32GB vs 16 in the 4). And then the 6 -> 7 features with the new display and whatnot. Probably a small handful of other things I missed.",Others
950,"More like the former I guess. It's not that the features they added weren't good (they are), but I know for me personally the watch doesn't change enough year to year to upgrade every year. I don't think Apple expects anyone but the absolute diehards to do that either probably. I feel like the 5/6 were more for new buyers or people coming from 2/3 than they were yearly upgraders.",Others
951,"I went from a 3 to a 6.   I likely won’t upgrade again for 3 more versions so,  keeping with the number scheme from the iPhone,  my next will be the Apple Watch X.  lol",Others

962,"1. Link the videos you are referring to. I have no idea who you are talking about so I can’t continue this conversation.

967,"> It literally isn’t as big of a difference by the numbers. What something seems and what it really is are two different things.

Except you can't look at it objectively like this. Size differences are all about perception. Reducing the bezels compared to just increasing the entire footprint, which is what happened with S3 -> S4, is going to make it *seem* like the difference is larger than it actually is. We're barely getting a larger case, but we're getting 20% more screen space, with greatly reduced bezels.

The jump from S3 to S4 was objectively larger, but the perception difference is going to be as big or bigger on the S7.",Others

The AOD brightness is dynamic and isn’t “stuck” or set to a particular percentage, however, the average brightness for AOD was about 200 nits.

So if you aren’t using it to streamline your work emails and calendars or to improve your health metrics tracking goals you won’t get much from it besides a pretty way to see the time.,Battery
1072,I’ve never heard smart watches pitched as divorcing you from your phone. Maybe just saving some battery. It’s also like a watch so it’s like a fashion statement which is like the only point of the higher-end models like you bought. I use mine a lot for the Home app and flashlight and mainly it lets you see if a notification is dumb or actually worth taking your phone out. I hear a lot of people like them for the alarm because it just taps you on the wrist. Mainly I feel like you paid more and expected more tech but you actually just got more fashion.,Others

Apple Heath can track *everything* down to the length of your stride, the oxygen level of your breathing, the quality of your sleep, the rhythmic pattern of your heart… and put it into a high quality, trackable data set that you can share with your doctor. Apple Watch is designed at its core to improve your understanding of your health. It’s the main reason people purchase this device. Beyond the health tracking features, the productivity features are almost a basic given. Complications are a cool way to track many things at once so play around with watch faces to find what gets the most of our if it for you. At the end of the day, it’s a watch.

1081,Plugging a phone is… is annoying? What? You’re not understanding the product at all here. The idea is that it does the same things your phone does so that you don’t have to have your phone out. You can keep your phone in your pocket. Obviously. If you just want fitness tracking by all means get a tracker that does only that. If you want a product that is a supplement to your phone and allows you to keep your phone out away in social situations while still being on alert then Apple Watch is the choice. It’s not for everyone. Definitely not for someone who thinks plugging a phone in is annoying. Seriously… people these days.,Others

1089,You seriously need to go to the Apple web site and look at all the info Apple give on using and owning an AW. Also there are lots of reviews on AW on YouTube and other tech review sites. Practically everyone here on this sub would recommend a S7 as it’s the latest model (this is a sub for AW after all) with the most features but also would recommend the SE too if money is an issue. All AWs and Apple Health app do not prioritise step counting as a primary judge of fitness.,Others

No regrets upgrading",Others
1092,I have the Apple Watch SE and it does the job for workout. I have more than enough info I need for when I work out. Only drawbacks are you get no ECG and always on display. That’s what I don’t like about mine. Other than that I’m happy with mine and hasn’t let me down.,Others

1108,EDIT: i bit the bullet. i’m enjoying this waaayyy too much right now. $175 for a 44MM SE GPS is a helluva steal. i will make a update post soon,Others
1109,"Honestly aesthetics in the end. First few weeks you'll try have fun messing around with all the feature then you'll just end up not using it for all it has. Only to see notifications if you're walking, your phone is not near you and to check time. Especially if you're in highschool and you're only part time it's really not that useful. And it's yet another thing to charge. You forget to charge it? Can't use it. And then if you really don't go out a lot then it's just gonna sit around eventually. My two cents is you could do a lot more with $190 than get a smart watch. If you want it to track fitness you can get a fitness band for way cheaper it also tells you the time, some even notifications. Then you can use the rest of the money on something else you really want. You want to just tell the time? Get a watch. You'll realise as well that you're just gonna reach for your phone anyway when you get a notification and such. A smart watch is a luxury not a necessity. If you're worried you could spend the money on other stuff especially if you don't have much already, don't buy it and spend it on something more useful to you.",Others
1110,"I’ve mine since christmas, and I’ve drived it daily since then. First months you will mess with the features, than you will start use it in a more practical way, like another user pointed out. But it’s still pretty useful to answer calls quickly, check the weather or your calendar. Also, it helped me to work out more. Not just a bit, a lot. I’m now doing some kind of exercise everyday to close the rings and get the achievement.",Others
1111,"I like mine because I had a tendency to walk out and forget my phone. What made me get it was because my dad passed away and my mom was trying to get ahold of me to deliver the news, but I had forgotten my phone at home. I went out that day and purchased an Apple Watch",Others
1112,I held off one because for the longest time I didn’t care about the fitness stuff. Quiet honestly still don’t. I got mine for two reasons. First - I’m a sucker for cool tech stuff. Second - I’m trying to detach myself from my phone a bit and if that means using my watch to play music while I go on 30 minute dog walks that’s fine with me.,Others
1113,I have ADHD and it’s been an absolute game changer for me. Just the use of being able to press a button on it to locate my iPhone was worth the money alone.,Others
1114,"It’s absolutely worth it!
Even more for $190!",Others
1115,Likely different for me as I'm much older. It encouraged me to get out and about and as a result I lost some weight. I can get notifications at work when I can't have my phone with me and it's also helped me to get better sleep. Frankly had I not had the watch I'd have gone back to Android.,Others
1116,"I was feeling the same way when I was about to get mine, and I decided to go for it in the end. IMO, totally worth it. I thought it would only be useful for when I exercise, but it actually motivates you to improve your lifestyle. It reminds you to breathe, to stand for a while when you have been sitting for too long and it is helpful to control your overall health. Being able to answer calls, see your notifications and reply to texts directly from your wrist when you don't have your phone next to you really comes in handy as well. And tbh $190 is a bargain, so I would definitely get it.",Others
1117,"It’s been one of the best gifts I have ever gotten.
I got the series 6 and the ekg really made a big different in monitoring my heart sensor.
I wear mine very say and love the compliments I get.
The only issue im having is that it’s better to upgrade with every new purchase",Others
1118,"Unless you already have an iPhone it would be a huge waste of limited resources. If you do, then research what it can and can't do. If your primary reason is that it looks cool then don't get it.",Others
1119,It’s helped me a lot mostly for keeping healthy,Others
1120,It’s a great addition to the phone. I use it throughout the day and I have lost 15 pounds since getting it.,Others
1121,"I use mine as a watch as well as a fitness tracker. I can’t saw how accurate the tracking is but it lets me know when I’m being too sedentary and helps me convince my brain to squirt happy juices when I accomplish things. Used it for calls maybe twice and I’m not a fan but it’s been a few watchOS versions since I tried so…
I don’t have the cell plan option and really don’t see how it’s worth it but that’s just me.",Others
1122,The Apple Watch helped me lose 20kilos and start a habit of being active through the ring closing app in activity. I also track fasts and meditations with it. So yes it’s definitely a super important product in my life if not the most important. If you don’t really care about the health features however it’s a pretty pointless product. The notifications on the wrist are nice but not game changing. I hardly use the calculator and the other apps at all.,Others
1123,"Sounds like you don’t need it.  I only use the Apple Watch to track my fitness, for text notification, and meeting notification. If you’re in school 8 hours a day then you’ll definitely have no use for it in that 8 hours.  I think it’s a waste if you’re not in an office and use it for exercise daily.",Others
1124,"I had the SE (4G+GPS) for about 5 months then sold it.   


I didn’t find it to be worthwhile as an everyday watch. Needs too much attention to charging everyday and wasn’t sufficiently standalone. Not enough customisation of how I want the screen to display info to serve as a day-long tool.  


I did find it to be good as a sports activity tracker, but then again fairly high priced for that segment of devices.

In the end it felt like wasted money sitting around too much, so I sold it to recoup. I might one day pick up a used GPS-only one for when I’m biking etc, if I find a cheap one. Would not pay full price at current price Structures as the value was just not there for me.",Others
1125,Of course. I couldn’t live without my Apple Watch because I am a fitness enthusiast. I have the series 6 and trying to decide if I’m going to get the 7 or wait until the 8 because I’m looking for more health upgrades,Others

1127,"I like mine, using it all the time to find my phone lol",Others
1128,I love my Apple Watch. My dad bought me a 5 last year. I used it a lot during the pandemic and stopped using it for a few months but I’ve been back to using it everyday. I have a 9 month old so it’s super easy to not have my phone one me but still able to answer texts. Also I love I can use Apple Pay and not take out my phone.,Others
1129,"It has improved my life a lot. Mainly because of its capability to track the calories you burn and your daily activity. The way I see it is that you can't improve what you can't measure. So, the Apple Watch allows me to improve in this aspect. All the other things are handy, having the calendar readily available, keeping track of the last time I fed my cat, no-screen way of getting GPS directions (and hence, a safer driving experience), and its ability to track my sleep quality are all great extras.",Others

1142,Why is it going obsolete in 5 years time?,Others
1143,"i do tend to forget stuff a bunch, so i use reminders pretty frequently. i also like walking and seeing how many steps/calories burned. heart rate stuff is pretty cool as well. i’m in love with the watch faces though, it’s the main selling point for me. that and the messaging lol. i’m seriously considering it thinking about it. if i regret it, it’ll be a nice learning stepping stone.",Watch Face
1144,"i figured. the first week i’ll be infatuated with the features and stuff, then it’ll become a handy *(dad pun intended)* extension of my phone. i’m still debating but when push comes to shove i’ll get it probably. if i’m not a fan, i’ll resell it.",Others

1158,"apple pay is accepted at most mainline places. it has gotten really prominent over quarantine due to tap to pay. i don’t know how much it will be used, i want to start working out again though. i know $190 is a little less than half off and that’s a steal",Others
1159,This is exactly why I'm considering an Apple Watch right now. Also in Europe and the constant mask wearing makes Apple Pay so annoying or just checking my phone in public in general. It's either that or going to Android for touch ID.,Others

spoiler alert..it’s not very good",Others
1165,I lost 45 pounds since I bought mine. I bought it for the fitness and health aspects. I love my series 6.   Might even upgrade to the 7 if it’s got enough new goodies.,Others
1166,"I know exactly how it be lol. Think about it, not for the brand. Think about it for what it will do for you and is it really worth it for you to get it now. It's a big purchase, use this as a learning step, just because you're a teenager doesn't mean you need to make stupid decisions. Other than that hope you can make the decision that makes you happy.",Battery
1167,I wouldn’t think so. $190 is already a great price. I sold my series 5 aluminum that had some surface scratches when it was a year old for $325.,Others
1168,My series 3 was 2 years old and sold for over $200.,Others

If already the sport thing is missing in your life and you have no intention to start it, I would say to leave (just cause you said that every dollar counts). In fact €190 for a brand new is a deal you won’t find again",Others
1177,Besides the new design and possibly slightly bigger display reports show it won’t be much different. Series 8 is when we may see newer health and fitness related features.,Others

so far….it’s not great. i’ve benched it already lol. it’s just not useful in my daily life :/ . it’s a cool addition; i’m going to wear it tomorrow to a formal event, other than that it provides no additional utility. i have started to excerise more, so hopefully I will get back into using it. otherwise, it’s face down on my dresser, dead. for me, charging it isn’t even worth the effort. i wish i would have saved my money kinda; i could really use it right now. i’ll probably never buy another one unless they completely revamp the watch.",Others

Also, if you exercise, do you wear it while doing so and how does it and the watch handle the sweat?",Others
1187,Mine scratches so easily!!! It’s way worse than my 3. I already have two deep gashes since release day. My 3 never had anything like that. Good thing I have apple care,Others

1195,"Same here. First time smart watch buyer, battery has been great (I charge at night). Normally finish around 16 hours with around half charge remaining.

Slack notifications all day, checking activity, workouts, flashlight, whatever.",Battery
1196,You would have to add the Phillip Hue light to homekit. And then you can control it with the watch by using Siri or the Homekit App.,Others
1197,Because I thought I would but then didn't plus I didn't want to go to a store and get a 4 when I can just get a 5 online with a band of my choosing and get 3% back with my Apple Card. Plus now in the future if I want to use always on I can since I have the option.,Others
1198,Hey no worries. It is holding up great. It’s never came off while working out when I’ve worked out. My wrists don’t normally get sweat so I don’t know how it would hold up. But it still looks like new to me.,Others

1209,"I did order the wrong size solo loop but that’s on me, not Apple. Luckily like many of you, I have a collection of other bands.",Others
1210,My series 6 lasts 2 days and at the end of exactly 2 days since last charge it’s at about 10% or under and at the end of one full day it’s at 60% so the series 7 is quite an upgrade in battery life,Others
1211,"Note that first day usage may be skewed a bit because you're likely using it more than normal setting it up.

It drained super fast on my first drain because I spent a lot of time messing with settings but now drain is reasonable even with AOD.",Others
1212,I believe you can also return just the band if your inside the return window of or and get the right size one,Others
1213,"Agreed. Though in my case, my results were for my first FULL day, not “the day I got it and tested everything I could”. Regardless, I’m very happy with both results and since I’m used to not having always on display, I may keep it off just to boost battery.",Others
1214,Thanks. I ordered online (too far from a store) but I’ll check it out. Appreciated.,Others
1215,"I just find it interesting. I learned my resting heart rate is WAY lower after an evening workout.  It was much less stable (I probably was restless) after drinking a fair bit. 

Not earth shattering, but good insight.  Made me feel more in touch with how I felt throughout the day when it was linked to metrics.",Others
1216,"I have a series 3. I definitely don’t think they should be selling it for that price, but honestly mine is completely fine for tracking my runs, workouts, etc.

I have the cellular version though which much have more storage because I’ve never had to do the factory reset to upgrade, etc.",Others
1217,It’s also priced to compete with other cheap watches on the market at a similar price range,Others
1218,It fools a lot of novices. A lot of people who arent tech-literate just see an Apple Watch for $199 and think it's a good deal and buy it. Had a friend and cousin buy it recently.,Others
1219,"Series 3 does fine for activity and sleep tracking, notifications, messages, timers, weather, heart rate, Apple Music, and no-contact bank and credit card functions. It’s an iPod Nano.",Others
1220,"it’s still a great no frills fitness tracker that is STILL somehow better than 2021  android wear watches AND fitbits while being cheaper than the both of them

also probably has some good industrial use",Others
1221,"Because most people with an Apple Watch don’t use any function besides telling time, and checking messages quickly.",Others
1222,"Honestly the price isn’t even good considering how old and slow it is.

Should’ve been the SE at that price point.",Others
1223,"It‘s used for up-selling.
You see how cheap the series 3 is, and start thinking about getting one.
Later, you visit the website and see the SE is just a little bit more expensive, and get it instead since you are already sold on the idea of getting an apple watch.",Others
1224,They should just give it away for back to school instead of AirPods if they really have too much inventory to clear for s3,Others
1225,"Kid’s first Apple Watch. Although, stupidly on my behalf, mine got the SE…",Others
1226,"I think it’s because the Series 3 isn’t really competing against the other Apple Watches.  It’s competing against the other fitness watches.  When viewed through that lens, the Series 3 does quite a bit for $199 if you’re someone who’s looking for a fitness tracker.",Others
1227,It’s a crappy choice to make the other choices look better in comparison. It also is good to compare and contrast with other models,Others
1228,It doesn’t even make sense bc it’s not much cheaper than the SE,Others
1229,It’s pretty slow on watch os 8 too. Watch os 7.5 was great performance even though the battery life wasn’t as good.,Others
1230,It’s a viable option for parents to buy an Apple Watch for their child/children without breaking the bank.,Others
1231,Would very much recommend a series 4 if you can snag one on eBay. I just picked up a S4 Cellular to replace my old S4 GPS and it still works wonders. I got my GF an S6 and can’t say that I feel like I’m missing much.,Others
1232,It’s plausible a lot of the people buying them clearly see it’s an older device but the price works for them.  They probably have realistic expectations and don’t use it for more then notifications and fitness tracking. Im sure when Apple can get the Se price down they will finally kill it.,Others
1233,"I have a friend who bought a Series 3 last week. She just wanted the fitness tracking and notifications, so it's perfect for her - and it's nearly half the price of the Series 7. So there's definitely an audience for it.

1235,The updates do not have that problem anymore btw.,Others
1236,"I’ve recently sold mine as I upgraded to a S7, but you are making it sound a lot worse than it is.

The Series 3 can still do all the basics of an Apple Watch, and that’s all some users want.",Others
1237,I think that’s the whole point. A $500 fitness tracker doesn’t sit right with people usually. $200 a lot more in line with cheaper fitbits and other fitness trackers,Others
1238,"The cellular model had 16GB of storage whereas the GPS model was 8GB, iirc.",Others
1239,"It also easier to decide to buy a watch at 200 and then decide to spend just a little more for the much better se. 

Pricing strategy",Others
1240,"Honestly I thought the same but knowing that the SE is the standard ""cheaper"" series make me wondering so I looked it up.",Others
1241,And ist maybe also the fact that people who bought it will stick tobapple and invest in a newer and more expensive one. But first thought was literally: apple why,Others
1242,"I like watching tech vids but not tech savvy sometimes. 

Esp not with apple products as an android guy. 

However..... spotted apple watch series 3 on sale black friday for 109 bucks and thought it made a great gift for my folks.

That is a decent price right?",Others
1243,"I have a series 3. I have put off upgrade after upgrade. 

It’s hardly fine. It’s slow, chunky, upgrading it is a whole ordeal. The extra for the SE for a new buyer is 100% the way to go. Save them from the misery.",Others
1244,This is fixed with newer updates.,Others
1245,"Idk, my GF has a series 3 and constantly has issues on every update.  As soon as the series 7 hits the family and friends store, I’m buying her one",Others
1246,"Indeed, Apple worked some kind of magic for watchOS and made it much smoother on the S3. WatchOS 7 was a nightmare for me to install. Ended up keeping my S3 for another cycle, trying to hold out for a redesign.",Others
1247,"I still have a series 3, before that I had a series 0 but so far and for my use I haven’t felt the need to upgrade at all..yes upgrading is a mess but other than that performance feels fine to me  
I do remember the huge jump from series 0 to 3 though",Others
1248,watchOS 8.0.1 improved the performance drastically. It actually was enough to make me put off buying a series 7.,Others
1249,"Couldn't agree with  you more man. I owned the series 3 about 2 years ago, and when I had it it was starting to slow down and become a headache. I can't imagine it now. I don't think its ethical of apple to be selling such a poor performing device.",Others
1250,"Yeah, mine runs like shit even after countless hard resets/wipes and then re-pairing it to my phone. I certainly wouldn’t buy a S3 today but I don’t wear it much so I’m still waiting to upgrade when they add more health sensors. Maybe next year.",Others
1251,I bought my series 3 shortly after it was released in 2017 and it still works great with no issues. I occasionally want to update but don’t have enough of a compelling reason to do so. I can even get away with charging it every other day depending on how much I’m using it.,Others
1252,"Yeah if you just stick to the default Apple apps the series 3 is still very good. I’ve given up using any third party stuff as it’s so much slower. 

Play/pause/skip is all pretty unresponsive for me in the Overcast app for example but the default music controls are instant.",Others
1253,"I dont know what to tell you, sorry its happening to you but i have a base model which has like 5gb and its working fine for me for a while now.",Others
1254,"Agreed.  I have the 3, 4 and 7.  3 is so fucking slow it's painful to use.",Others
1255,"Yes, watchOS 8 now has incremental updates like iOS.",Others
1256,For a given value of “slow”. I find my older iPads to be painfully slow in comparison to the latest. Someone who has never used one think they are fast.,Others

1289,"No problem, thank you for reading :) 

Yes I think it isn’t there yet. Perhaps one running a meant-to-be-stand-alone OS (like a skinned Android) with a Bluetooth mini QWERTY keyboard would the issues I’ve highlighted. Sort of like a tiny blackberry with a wrist strap. At that point though I would glue one to the other and make a mini BB. But then you could just get a Jellyphone 2 at that point. 

One other consideration that popped up for me a few times is that it’s your phone on your wrist. If you are going to a formal event, it really stands out and makes you look like a SpyKid. I think most smartwatches will, the displays look too 2D to fool anyone that it’s not a ‘real’ watch (even with Always-On). I guess you could take off the straps and keep it in your pocket, but its so little and slippery it will end up flying into someone’s wine.",Others
1290,"Funny story, a Jelly 2 is what I actually use now 😂 now I just have to attach it to my wrist.",Others

1296,i am also very happy with my SE - works very well overall,Others

1304,I accidentally smashed my Series 4 literally 42 days outside of my AppleCare warranty and ended up buying an SE to replace it with. It’s like 99% of the features for 70% of the price. Hard to go wrong in terms of value.,Others

1308,Bought it over the 5 because I don't need all the two extra features the 5 has.,Others
1309,"I love the SE. I can say it’s even better than the 6 because of Cost and that it has more storage than the S3, so it’s a win for me. Plus I use it all the time when I’m listenin to Music, so I don’t have to rewind a song from my phone when I can do it on my wrist. And let’s not forget the Fitness. Major plus for me. I’ve been a Apple Watch owner for over a year now, movin from the S3 to the SE and I’m glad I decided to get it, because this watch is a Game Changer!",Others

1311,"I think that's the best Apple Watch made to date, because how many first Watch users can buy a great device with much lower price (especially in more poor countries where it makes really significant difference). Great business decision and execution. Win for users and for Apple.",Others
1312,Upgraded from series 3 to SE back a few months ago and I love it,Others

1314,I love it,Others
1315,I loved mine. Had it for a couple weeks then it broke (Apple replaced it for free) but I need an Apple Watch so I upgraded to the series 6. It’s a great buy. The only thing I didn’t like about it was no always on display.,Others

1318,"I am considering getting one. It would be my first Apple Watch, if ever, and I am thrilled to read the positive comments in this post!",Others
1319,Went from S3 to the SE over the S6 and don’t regret it. Maybe should have waited since the S7 will have flat sides but overall the SE was a no brainer.,Others

1322,I’ve had my SE for about six weeks now. It’s my first ever smart watch and I love it.,Others

1335,For the price difference I saved up for the series 6 so I could have the always on display. Given it’s gonna be an investment for me I decided to save a little longer to get it. Now I’m waiting for the series 7 to come out hopefully in September lol,Others
1336,I’ve been using my series 1 for 5 years and I can’t believe I wanted so much to change it,Others

1342,I just got mine today! I love it so much,Others

1344,"As someone who doesn't give a damn about EKG and AOD, the SE was perfect for me. Then again, I use Voiceover with screen curtain enabled. Helps me get almost 50 hours out of this thing. Only thing I wish it had was 5 GHz WiFi.",Others

1346,I have one :),Others
1347,"Certainly not exactly a “cheap” watch, but for what it offers, it’s a rather decent deal. Pretty happy with my AW SE",Others
1348,I went for series 6 which is the most feature rich version but the SE is fine for younger people,Others
1349,I love my Apple Watch SE it's a fantastic product for its price.,Others
1350,Love it.,Others
1351,"How does the SE compare to the 3 practically speaking? I can read specs, but I’d like to know how it plays out in practice. I’ve had a 3 for about a year now, and it gets bogged down a lot. I don’t even have a lot on it. Just playing music and Nike Run Club at the same time can cause crashes.",Others
1352,In love with mine. Nike SE from now on,Others
1353,I love it and well worth the price.,Others
1354,"The SE has served me brilliantly! Best value for money by far. In fact, I have the same band as yours too! Which has also served me brilliantly in cooperation with the cream sports loop! Though mine is a 44mm cellular instead of 40mm regular. Hope you enjoy yours!",Others

Other than that, it's solid.",Others

1361,Anybody have any photos of different bracelets with the standard grey SE?,Others
1362,I love my SE! Great investment.,Others
1363,"I decided to go with the SE as well, as I won't use Always-On (my girlfriend turned hers off to save battery and improve privacy) and am not in need of the health features of the Series 6. Also, my choice of style (color and metal) is the same on the SE and Series 6, so although I could just as well have bought a Series 6, I couldn't see any reason to not just take the SE, as the things I need is identical.",Others
1364,"I’m loving it. No need spending twice the price for sensors I’m not gonna use. I do miss the AOD a little bit, but definitely not enough to justify the price of an S6",Others
1365,"I bought an S3 back in 2019 to see if I would fit with an Apple Watch and really took to it, then I got the SE when it came out, mostly for the bigger display as I didn’t feel I’d miss any of the other features and it’s been incredible. I passed the S3 on to my wife and she loves it.",Others
1366,DONT TAKE IT SWIMMING!!! MINE DIED!!,Others
1367,A really good upgrade from the series 3 in terms of speed and screen size,Others
1368,"Upgraded from a £60 fitbit and WOW I’m impressed. I had the fitbit inspire (without heart rate) before, but I made the decision to buy the SE a year and a half after I got it. The fitbit was basically a pedometer that can tell the time, and the AW is what a smartwatch should be. The features I liked best after upgrading were: colours & custom face, apps, Apple health stats, and the way it syncs so easily with my phone without having to open up the AW app. Really impressed with it so far and glad I got it over the S3 and S6",Others
1369,My first Apple Watch and I love it.,Others
1370,"I bought the S5 after the S3 got broken before the launch of s6 
The screen always on function is a huge battery drainer so i never used it",Others
1371,Honestly the Apple Watch SE is the like best Apple Watch you can get right now apart from the Apple Watch Series 6 it’s a really good watch recommended I own it I’ve owned it since 2 July and it has been the best watch watch,Others
1372,I think the se is really Gud even now that they have the ecg on it,Others
1373,I have the same watch band and everything but mines like space grey or something,Others

1379,"GPS on the SE is the same as on the 6, ja?",Others
1380,My first smart watch and I love it. Super useful in keeping track of your fitness and wellness goals.,Others
1381,I charge mine for only 15 minutes a day while I'm showering and pooping and it never dies.,Battery
1382,I like the bang for buck you get with the SE but I had to get a always ON display & yes I know it’s NOT worth the extra money.,Others
1383,just got it  from black friday and love it!!!  need to watch videos on it tho on youtube to get use to and how to make the watch more usefull but love it!,Others
1384,Absolutely the same feeling here,Others
1385,Everything since the 4 looks the same. Mind you after owning a 4 for nearly 4 years I am happy that it still looks modern apart from the scratches,Others
1386,"The SE is very nice. If I was upgrading this year, that’s what I would have gone with. However, I upgraded last year from an S1 to S5 and absolutely love the always on display. I wouldn’t be able to go back to a watch that doesn’t have it. The EKG I could very easily go without, it’s neat and I guess nice to know everything’s fine but it wouldn’t be something that I wanted to hang onto like the always on display is.",Others
1387,"exactly I got an SE too, but from where I am, the SE is  actually 70$ expensive than the Series 6 in U.S. due to the taxes and stuff.  Sk basically if I was in U.S. this money would have gotten me S6 but I lobe my SE anyway :)",Others
1388,"or AOD, but same thing still applies",Others
1389,Yeah your statement is true. AOD drains battery . IMO I think Apple will discontinue the S3 this year and bring the SE’s price down even more . The SE is what the Apple Watch was meant to be . Instead of paying an overpriced $399,Battery
1390,"What do you like better about the SE vs 3? I’m trying to decide which to get, not sure if the SE is worth 35% more in price?",Others
1391,I don’t get why many people want this feature anyway? You could just raise your wrist and the screen will instantly turn on. Not to mention AOD takes up lots of battery!,Others
1392,The always on display is annoying as hell in a movie theater and can get you kicked out if you don’t turn it off.,Others
1393,i agree it cost me US$379.15 here in isr ael for the very 40mm base model!,Others
1394,forgot the list mode was an option—trying it out now!,Others

1400,The Deep Navy Sports Loop!,Others
1401,I have the GPS only version. Bought it last October because I was on a prepaid phone plan which doesn't allow any extra devices. I just switched to postpaid so I'll be looking to get the cellular version here soon. I'll definitely be sticking with the SE though. No reason to pay extra for features that I'm not interested in and the SE is a great price for what it offers.,Others

Is it to make it look more pretty?",Battery
1409,"Eh, I’ve not had any battery issues with my Series 6 yet. In fact, I am getting better battery life right now than when I was using my Series 6, without messing with the display.",Others
1410,For me when I’m lifting I like to glance without having to put the weights down to flick my wrist a particular way,Others
1411,I thought I’d like it but I found it to be more annoying. So it’s off. Now I wish I just saved the money and got an SE :(,Others
1412,"Once you get used to it you can’t go back, imo. Also I still get 1-2 days out of my series 5 with AOD on.",Others
1413,To be able to just glance at the watch and get a ton of info makes it a must for me. Especially like on the bike.,Others
1414,"With the tech, aod sips power, if that on the watch",Others
1415,"I really don’t know. The screen wouldn’t turn on but if you touched it, it would still do stuff like you could feel it vibrate if you clicked on something. Me and the guy at Best Buy had no idea how or why it did that.",Others
1416,"Without this options Apple Watch is mostly Notification Center for me. Sometimes music controller, which is still mi band functions. Apple Pay doesn’t seem that useful when you always have an iPhone in pocket. The only interesting feature is MacBook unlock, but it’s kinda security hole in many scenarios for me and ecosystem only. Apps are mostly useless, just like terrible realisation of telegram app. So you see my point I hope.",Others
1417,"And one more thing, look at price gap between mi band and Watch SE. That is a big one. Especially when you consider those devices as pretty similar. Yet, price gap between SE and 6-7 is much lesser, but you are having whole Apple Watch experience with a lot of health features and so on. That’s a personal opinion of course, but my thoughts about this is when you spend a couple of hundred bucks, pay a bit more and have a lot more. If not, just go with cheaper similar thing which even lives longer.",Others
1418,"for me on a budget, I’d happily miss those things out for an SE and a unspent hundred bucks. If I had more money I’d definitely go for the s6 for the AOD and stainless steel option",Others
1419,"Also worse GPS. I think the SE is kind of a trap. With the series 7, the 6 will become TE watch to buy even if on a budget.",Others
1420,Good ECG is important. This from AW is not good and gives a lot of false positives.,Others
1421,"He can't answer that because it hasn't been 4 years since the release of the Series 4. It's been 3.

EDIT: Actually hasn't been 3 years yet, either. It will be so next month.",Others

1423,Honestly haven’t noticed much of a change but I never really let it below 30%,Others
1424,"Personally I turn it in during workouts and I feel it’s very useful in those cases. I always have trouble getting the screen to turn on while running, biking or swimming and it’s very convenient to see your stats at a glance. After the workout, I usually turn it off. The battery drain is not worth it IMO.",Others
1425,"with AOD on and display set to max brightness, my cellular model will last till 6am. I get up at 6-7. 24 hour battery life isn't that bad",Others
1426,same thing over here on my series 6,Others
1427,"That’s what the SE is aimed for. You want to try Apple Watch? Buy SE, you love Apple Watch? Buy Series 6, that have many more features",Others

1429,Always On Display. :),Others
1430,"yup, I can't stand that guy, he's such a creepy nerd, but his comments are mostly valid in this video. Maybe you're just biased towards apple.",Others

",Others
1432,"Really good at notifications in exactly the same way that a Pebble is, since it's an Apple product you have a little more granular control over notifications but overall very similar to Pebble and other smartwatches. All of the stuff that isn't notifications/communication is kinda janky. The other stuff it adds is kind of a mixed bag (buggy/slow, non-native apps, but sometimes things work well). Industrial design is really good.",Others
1433,Good question. Some of the reviews were so underinformed (*cough cough* ^Nilay *cough* ^MKBHD) it's amazing they managed to get through a review of version 1.,Others
1434,"Plus, you can read your notifications in imperfect light. Unlike the Pebble. ",Others
1435,"I came from an S2, to a S7 and wow, what a jump. The screen, the sensors, to even just the look was a crazy difference. I also went from 42mm to 45mm and it actually fit better for me. The new Midnight color is also black, which I prefer over the space gray. IMO it's worth it to get the better technology, but it's not that different from the 6, so if you want to save $100 go for the 6, or even the SE if you don't need the sensors.",Others
1436,"i personaly just got a 6 because it was on sale and the 7 was to expensive. and from what i can tell they r pretty similar. 7 has faster charging, is a lil bigger, stronger front glass, and that's abt it i belive. so to me those things were not worth $130 more",Others
1437,"I had a S3, but traded up to a S4 and the difference was night and day.  I'm tempted with a S7 as well but will probably stick with my S4 as the feature gap between it and the S4 (IMO) isn't that big.  If you really think you'll use an Apple Watch then I would go for the S7 as you'll definitely notice the difference coming from a S3.",Others
1438,"you're not getting anything worthwhile over the Series 6, or even the Series 5 for that matter.",Others
1439,"“Worth it” is pretty subjective. It sound like you didn’t get much out of a series 3 and there’s not much that the series 7 does over the series 6 (or even the series 5). Definitely don’t get the series 3 either way, that’s way too old now, but you could pick up a pretty good condition series 5 or 6 used (or even new in box).

But if you didn’t like the watch before, I’m not sure what you would be getting out of it a second time around.",Others
1440,"Think back to why you sold your Series 3.  What were you using the Apple Watch for?

I personally believe the Series 7 is a fantastic Apple Watch but the price tag is out of my reach.  I was also looking at the SE, which I ended up getting to replace my Series 3, and what sold me on that was expandability.

Sure, you can buy a new 42mm Series 3 for $200 or less.  With the way Apple's software updates have been going, they are making it difficult to update the Series 3 to a new watchOS because of the limited amount of space on the watch.  The Series 6, Series 7, and SE all have 32GB of space while the Series 3 only has 8GB.  Come OS update time you're possibly looking at having to delete stuff off the Series 3 watch, unpairing, pairing, and updating.  Pain in the ass.",Others
1441,Well I would have to disagree with some of the comments here I went from a series 5 to a series 7 with cellular on the new seven series and the screen size makes a huge difference in particular for a 40 year old man who is struggling with seeing things up close. The fast charging is brilliantly better than on my series 5 I could not be happier with my purchase and the upgrade from 5 to 7,Others
1442,I just upgraded from a aw5 to a 7. My husband got it for me as a Xmas Present. Only reason I upgraded was because the 40mm screen was ro small for me. I don’t have the best eyes and it was super hard to read notifications. Now with 45mm 7 I have no problem! I also love the keyboard I use it to text a lot.,Others
1443,"S3 to S7 was worth it just for the extra watch faces alone, but the bigger screen size is a nice bonus. S4 already had some of the better faces so you may be alright if it isn’t that important to you.",Others
1444,">I had a S3, but traded up to a S4 and the difference was night and day.

If you really think you'll use an Apple Watch then I would go for the S7 as you'll definitely notice the difference coming from a S3.

1445,"For me, screen size (noticeably bigger on S4), responsiveness (S3 very sluggish compared to S4) and - most of all for me - the Infograph faces which are S4+ only.",Others
1446,"An absolute joke that some people believe Apple swerved to this on a whim. I know the leakers don't want to admit they were wrong, but geez. It lacks any commons sense to say these changes could be done quickly.",Others
1447,"The 7 looks great to me People complain about the 7 this year not having an updated chip and new sensors, but honestly how many more sensors do we need? And you don’t really need a new chip every year, as long as it pretty snappy when opening the text app or email it’s good, it’s not like a phone where it needs a whole Lotta processing power.
Heard the flat edge design was supposedly planned for this year and then canned….and saved for the series 8, if that’s the case I’m grabbing a 7, so far I don’t care for any of the renders of that design, too techy looking to wear on my wrist,like a tiny iPhone with straps. The rounded edges at least give off more of a watch like feel to me.",Others
1448,"I’m tempted to buy as my 1st ever smart watch. Although, I might wait for the improved SoC which I believe should release next year when they move to 4nm, I don’t know. It’s a high cost, and I know it probably will only have a 4-5 year lifespan, whereas my citizen eco watch is probably 15 yrs old.",Others
1449,I love the series 6. Definitely going to be upgrading to the 7. With the larger screen I think the 40mm might be better now.,Others

1455,"I would personally wait one more year. I know people always say “if you wait you’re gonna wanna wait longer since companies are always innovating” but I suspect we will see Apple Watch on a newer CPU node (better battery life), more health features and maybe new design next year.",Others
1456,Exactly! It blows my mind that they are unable to think they were duped or that they simply got wrong info. They act like changing the Watch design is like changing a shirt and can be done at the last minute. Crazy,Others

1458,"Honestly we’re rapidly approaching “why bother” territory with CPU improvements for watches. I would be much more excited for new sensors.

Battery life is definitely the apple watch’s pain point.

I would say, try and pick up an Apple Watch 6 for cheaper. They have been going on sale for $250 periodically for a while.",Battery
1459,"Honestly, go for it now. They’re so good now that there’s not going to be much more perceivable difference in performance for anything the watch will do. Series 4 was a big leap forward and it’s been smooth sailing ever since.",Others

See you in 2022 i guess.",Others
1461,"I expect they’d go to 5nm next. The S4-7 are 7nm, still based on the a12 and a13 lmfao. I doubt they’d skip 5nm and go straight to 4nm but maybe lol",Others
1462,I'd recommend you getting a Series 4 used for a good price if you could. I think that's the best deal you're gonna get honestly. I had S3 and switched to S4 a year later. The change was massive. I've tried S5 and S6 but they're just the same if you don't use always-on display.,Others

My S5 have started losing my heart rate for 1-5 minutes during my runs. It's almost never for a majority of a run, so at the moment I'm not too annoyed, just a little perplexed. Well, my previous Forerunner instead often just showed my heart rate at ""sitting"" rate when I was trying to run at a decent speed (I am not an experienced runner), so I guess a wrong heart is more annoying than no measurement. 

""Sleep"" have given me some weird sleep and wake up times when I tried it, so for that I use the Forerunner instead. 

So yeah, I agree with your assessment of the AW,",Others

1609,"Yes, I have used both a Wahoo Tickr and Polar H9 chest strap with the Apple watch. As soon it's connected via bluetooth, the heart rate readings are coming from the chest strap instead of the watch. You can confirm this by using the heart rate app. If you get an instant reading, it's coming from the strap and not the watch. Another way is to log a workout, go to the Health app, and under Heart Rate you'll find ""Show All Data"". Most workout apps will mention your chest strap as the source. Some apps just mention the app as a source, regardless of whether or not you're using a chest strap.",Others

Is Garmin’s data even accurate or are the numbers on their Watch just fluff? Like body battery, heart rate, or any metric it measures? Then again, how accurate is apples in a lab setting? We are all wearing these devices to get these data points but can the data gathered actually stand up to lab tests?

Small update but I just got the watch, think it was 70% charged when turning it on. Have done couple hour long workouts and never plugged in and still at 12 days of battery. Apple get on this level.",Battery
1612,I really like having Body Battery and find that it is a very useful training tool. I check my morning HRV using other apps already but I’ve noticed certain behaviors which reduce HRV and sap my battery. I also use Stryd for running and train by power rather than pace. The major benefit of the Fénix over the Apple Watch for me is the battery life and sleep metrics.,Battery

1618,"Thanks for all of this insight.  Currently on an AW4, it currently serves my needs but whenever the Fenix 7 comes out I will consider making the change.  The ability to use it as a cycling headunit, golf gps, as well as battery for long hikes and runs all appeals to me as I won't need to worry about charging for weekend trips.      

I feel like I may miss the ease of use of responding to texts etc on my watch... but hopefully after a while I will forget I even had that option.",Battery

1623,"For me, the body battery metric on the latest firmware is absolutely spot on. I’m really impressed with it as a metric - though I don’t necessarily use the information as a tool. It simply validates the way I’m feeling (which I suppose is a form of bias). 

Same with the sleep metrics.",Battery
1624,"I find measurements from AW and Fenix pretty similar, including calories, VO2max, HR max, HRrest and so on. There are differences, but these are couple % differences.

I guess that number of people who really care about this kind of measurements is preety small (and they all use proper sport watches), the majority of people is just fine with closing rings and Training Status is something that would mostly de-motivate them ;)

I'd love to see Apple Watch Garmin Edition instead of Nike edition - that would be best watch ever.",Others
1625,"Just the response I was looking for. The AW touchscreen blows for running. In the summer, my sweaty paws can't swipe. In the winter, my sleeve rubbing against the screen will cause it to do something crazy. It's really annoying when you are finishing up a run and look down to see your AW workout paused.",Others

For me the biggest issue is the API on the weather which is nearest weather station (fortunately mine is only 8miles away), rather than doing it via direct location and using a source like Weather Channel etc. But if your nearest one was 100miles or so away (which some people have) it wouldn't be of much asssistance.",Others

Same error is obviously good enough if you train for yourself (like I do), but getting consistent readout is also a hard thing: GPS signal strength varies if there are dense clouds, so on that days you might get different distance (and pace as a consequence).

I'd imagine that, as technology does, it's gotten cheaper and more accurate in the last decade. The question is whether it's cheap enough for a device like the Apple Watch, and accurate enough to replace finger-prick testing.

It would be a hugely disruptive tech to include if it satisfies both of those requirements.  There's *big* money being made exploiting the testing needs of diabetics.  I wouldn't doubt there's some part of that industry doing whatever they can to stall or prevent something like this coming to market.",Others

1705,"I mean, the lack of info on progress of the tech in the past ten years might also be an indication it’s not advancing and getting better or cheaper. 

Trust me, there’s no conspiracy. The first to do glucose monitoring without a prick of any kind is going to make a killing. They all currently require a device to be imbedded in your skin at the moment and frequent maintenance. 

As for current glucose monitoring, using a CGM with a smartphone is a nightmare as the FDA has to approve each version of the device’s app. This often means you can’t update your OS or risk your monitor no longer working. 

I don’t know how Apple could get around this. “This glucose monitor is not intended to make medical decision”. Yeah that’s not going to cut it.",Others

1708,Sounds lame as hell and seems like just a way rich people like to flex,Others
1709,"I totally hear you. Totally understand the use case. When I go hiking it’s really quite annoying to bring a watch charger with me, 

But i think there should be better solutions out there than stuffing the watch with battery for the 5 or 6 times a year that we go 3 days without charging.

Assuming you’re at least taking your phone camping with you? And that you might be bringing some from of power to keep that charged? I’d just really like to see apple simplify the way the watch charges, something Qi based, something that lets the watch charge via the iphone? I dono. 

I totally hear how annoying the watch is to charge when traveling, but when you’re not traveling I’m always gonna charge it daily, its just simpler to have a routine like that,  once you have a routine around charging your devices they’re just never out of battery and you never even have to worry about it.",Others
1710,That’s crazy my se lasts just under 3 days on a charge. I don’t even have a charger at my girlfriends house because it don’t need it.,Battery
1711,"Good points.  I agree that they couldn't get away with the ""non-medical"" distinction that they do for the blood-oxygen sensor. Some folks would be using that glucose data to determine things like insulin dosage.  That's not something you want to mess around with.

I would assume that they'd need to deal with any sort of glucose monitoring function in roughly the same way the EKG function (which IIRC also required FDA approval) is managed. I'm not sure of the particular details of what's required for that, but I'd guess it's similar to other medical devices.",Others
1712,"Not a very good flex if you’ve never heard of it. It is unnecessary, but so are muscle cars from the 60s and yet people buy them. Just a hobby.",Others
1713,Is the luxury watch industry something you weren’t aware existed or what?,Others
1714,"I charge it in the evening because I wear it at night for sleep tracking. Usually what happens is that I get invested in something at home and forget to charge it before bedtime, then I have to just put it on the charger during the night and lose that night’s sleep tracking so I can use it the next day. Normally this works fine but on days I’ve been using a lot of transit directions it dies before the end of the day easily.",Others
1715,"Fair points.  If the battery life was a bit longer I’d be happier.  I do like the AOD but I need the watch to not die on me before I get home.  Here’s hoping the 7 series does better, Apple always seems to improve battery life each generation by virtue of advancing tech.",Others
1716,"No, not even close. Royal oaks are not income generating assets and I don’t know that you can make a solid long term investment case. People buy the, because they like them",Others
1717,"I know what a Rolex is, that’s pretty much the only luxury brand of watch I can name. I had a g-shock when I was a young teen, but otherwise the only watches I ever owned was that and my Apple Watch. When I was in college I started wearing a pedometer to count my steps, which is why I enjoy the Apple Watch (and also because it helps me stay off my phone as much because I see my notifications on my watch instead of checking my phone throughout the day)",Others
1718,This would be amazing.,Others
1719,I would LOVE this.,Others
1720,"Agreed 99%. But someone spending this much money on a watch is doing it obviously because they can, but I’m pretty sure they want to as well. If I had that much money to pretty much waste, I would totally buy a watch instead of something like an old car like I mentioned. It’s more interesting in my eyes. And car guys would probably scratch their heads about why all the same.",Others
1721,Battery life on the WatchOS8 Beta have been atrocious on my series 6,Battery
1722,"Meh, even if I was a car or watch person I couldn’t see myself spending that much on anything. Well I guess the equivalent of a car would be a lot more expensive too. Let’s put it this way, if I came into a fortune I could dock around with, I would pay off student debts and buy a house first. I would probably upgrade my car, but I wouldn’t be buying a Ferrari or anything like that. Other than that…. I don’t really think my spending would change all that much if at all.",Others
1723,Well it’s a beta. But I’m worried to hear that,Others
1724,"Dude, it’s not that I *want less battery life* 

Obviously less battery life is not ideal. 

It’s that *I want a thinner watch*",Others
1725,"I really don’t understand some people. 

“I decided I wouldn’t wear it and now it’s just sitting there. Useless”",Others
1726,"I don’t wear jewelry and I told myself that I would never get the watch. However, after my boss recommended it for work and leisure, I decided to get the 6 series GPS + cellular. Have to say after a little over a month using it I’ve come to love it. I put it on in the morning before going to the gym and the only time I take it off before I go to bed at night is when I take a shower. I like the Siri functionality especially with my AirPods Pro in. It also works really well when I take a walk at night time and leave my phone on the couch. I can listen to music and still answer calls, texts and emails from the watch. I do, however, wish that Apple would focus on the Home app on the watch when not connected to WiFi or connected to your phone via Bluetooth. My Home accessories don’t seem to respond over my watch’s cellular data. That’s really the only problem I’ve run into so far.",Others
1727,"I think the reality is that from outside the Apple Watch seems like really cool tech but it’s not obvious if it’s actually something you will use.  I wasn’t sure before I got it.  Turns out I use it a lot and love it.   But I can see how some people wouldn’t.  I almost forget my use case doesn’t match everyone else.  For instance ... I don’t use Siri at all, for anything and have literally never paired headphones to mine.  

Also ... I have an iPad.  I don’t use it.   At all.  Ever.  I know some people love them.  

Truth is we have a lot of overlapping tech and which pieces are most useful depends on you.   The parts of the watch that are really specific are the all day calorie/health stat tracking.  If you don’t use that given almost everyone carries a phone it’s certainly going to be a “maybe” as to whether you love the watch.",Others
1728,This has to be satire. It has to be.,Others

1732,I also have an iPad that I’ve barely ever used. I agree we have overlapping tech. That’s why I think it even stranger to turn to a watch for “entertainment.”,Others
1733,"I got the iPad mini at launch, thinking it was the size that turned me off. Nope. I like a keyboard, and multiple windows, and multi-tasking, etc. the iPad is just a Netflix movie tablet for when I travel and camp. hah",Others
1734,"Totally. But what’s so confusing about this to me is the expectations are just weird. It’s a one-inch screen that’s advertised primarily for health and fitness tracking, or an extension of your phone’s basic functions. Why would anyone expect it to be a consumption device?

Not finding a device useful for you, fair ‘nuff. I love my iPad, but I can see why it just wouldn’t fit into some people’s needs.

But you perceive a difference between whether the iPad offers anything to you in particular, and whether it’s bad at what it does offer and what it’s supposed to be. Those are two different questions.

Expecting things that just make no sense and then giving a bad review of the device for not living up to an illogical expectation is just odd.",Others

1831,I think you're just seeing the blue daylight reflecting from a nearby window or daylight LED lamp.,Others

The watch works and doesn’t have a scratch on it, but it’s bulky on my wrist and somewhat slow to respond to taps. I’m hopeful that I can get a slightly smaller form factor without compromising the size of the display, and I am really looking forward to not having to tap to see the time!",Others

1955,Exactly. Wasn’t the last report of Teslas being “hacked” revolving around a third-party app?,Others
1956,"So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way",Others

1962,">So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way

Its not the app on the watch controling your car.. that is not possible because everything needs to go through tesla servers and be verified with tokens etc. Basically what the app does is imitate the original tesla app by issuing the same commands and using its token. If it is open source and it can be seen that the tokens are stored on your device not on some db hosted with the developer then it is safe as it works exactly like the original. But as you said those token gives access to your car and anyone sharing them needs to be cautious about it.",Others
1963,"I did use the “remote start” under settings before to remote start the car before heading to the garage, but then my phone was with me … will try without the phone altogether.",Others
1964,"Yeah, but that token cannot simply be stolen like that. It's not like it's laying around. It's within the apps realm only.",Others
1965,"There’s two ways you would do this where you wouldn’t share your credentials with a third party. 

First is to make the requests directly to Teslas servers from an application, second would be to set up a self-hosted server that facilitates interaction with Tesla’s servers and no third party. 

Either way you’re typing your credentials into an “unofficial” app, they’re just never going anywhere but to either yourself, or Tesla.

I haven’t looked into how Tesla handles authentication, but I doubt they have an Oauth system.",Others
1966,"I'm not suggesting it can be ""stolen"" because it doesn't need to be, it's already been given freely to the app.

Once you have the token, the app can harvest data it wants, and can send whatever command it wants. The developer can do anything the token has access to do.",Others
1967,"The people that are trying to protect their data harvesting businesses are down voting you too now. 

If I wanted to gather data for myself id do exactly as you described. I honestly don't think most of these people understand the danger of giving a third party access to your secrets.",Others

I checked my previous orders to make sure I wasn’t losing it and sure enough a band i paid $32.99 for at regular price (not during a sale) was listed as a “Black Friday sale” for $32.99 marked down from $109.96. I HATE when companies do that. In reality, they’ve  never actually had a true sale. Also, their shipping is super sketchy. It takes forever to get your order even though it’s coming from New York and shipping within the US. there is no tracking and you just have to hope you didn’t get your money stolen.",Others

So without that support, things will be missed occasionally. MKBHD travels to every launch event and interview in person, uses the products, writes the script, then films and edits the videos. 

He does have a bit of extra help now, but he is still crazy busy, so some mistakes will be made. 

It’s easy for us tech-nerds to pick out mistakes in the final video because we only see 4-15 minutes of the hours and days that go into filming and writing, and our minds are fresher with facts on the content.

I ordered the smaller size, which is fine (I wore a 9 on my Solo Loop), allowing about 7 “links” to overlap onto the smaller band.  I wonder if the larger band would have been better allowing more of the magnets to hold the band in place.  I am going to go to my local Apple store to try the large band on as I still have a week to make an exchange.  Oh and by the way, the 7 is amazing.

2191,"If your heart is set on an S3 then get the cellular even if you are not planning using cellular capability. This model has enough memory to update without going through all the shenanigans necessary with the GPS model. But, as the others are saying, you will miss out on so many features available in the newer watches. If price is your pain point buy an S5 from swappa.com.",Others
2192,I suppose it’s likely that the price of the older models will go down once the new model is released. Maybe I’ll wait until September…,Others
2193,"Thank you for your input! Sounds like if I want a new one, it’s either the SE or wait until the 7 comes out and get a 6 for cheaper.",Others
2194,"I just posted a similar question, here’s the thread. I ended up going with the 7, but I do plan to use it quite a lot.

2195,"Get the SE. Since you’re 14, many of the Health features won’t benefit you. You can’t use ECG anyways… Since you won’t rely on it as much as you said, might as well keep the money and use it towards a better phone instead.",Others
2196,"I didn’t want to pay for the 7 but wanted AOD. So I just got an open-box six on Ebay for 275 w. free shipping, same cost as a new SE. I think I’m going to be happy with it, assuming the seller actually sends it and it’s in the promised condition 😂. If not, of course, there’s always the eBay money back guarantee.",Others
2197,"I got the series 7 on launch day; it is my first smart watch. After having it for two weeks, I'd say I wish I had gotten the SE when it came out last year instead of waiting all this time for the 7. Blood oxygen sensor and ECG are total gimmicks, so unless you have a legitimate cardiovascular health concern, I'd save a few dollars and go with the SE. Fast charging and the big screen are nice, but I don't think it justifies the increase in price. Also the keyboard is a bitch to actually use. Go with the SE, I think you'll like it.",Others
2198,"I had the SE before, I didn’t upgrade but it’s a long story and now i have the S7, let me tell you that I wouldn’t really have upgraded, now the S7 is soooo nice, big screen, faster charging, keyboard, always on display and more health sensors, i would say if you don’t care about always on display, the screen difference isn’t something that you would notice, it is something that you get used to, if you got the SE believe me the bigger bezels aren’t that noticeable, and the faster charging is nice, but if you have time before sleep that you don’t need your watch the SE is good enough, the health sensors, well it depends you know more about yourself of course, hopefully I didn’t miss a lot, i would say that you won’t regret both, if you have any questions don’t be bothered to ask me 👍",Others
2199,"I
Don’t think the ECG would actually work for you if you go by your real age. There’s a age requirement to use the feature.",Others
2200,"Id go with the SE just because it can do almost everything the 7 can do. Another option that I’d highly recommend is to check third party retailers like Best Buy and Target, I saw the Series 6 for $250 on Best Buy one day which is an insane deal considering you aren’t missing out much from the 7",Others
2201,I don’t use the O2 sensor nor the ECG and still bought the series 7. The bigger screen is gorgeous and I like the new colours (starlight). I’m 28 and have a good job tho so thankfully for me the price gap between the SE and the Series 7 wasn’t a decisive factor. If you’re tight on money go for the SE. You’ll love it,Others
2202,I’m also 14 and I have the SE 40mm and it’s perfect for me so I’d recommend the SE ;),Others
2203,"It seems you’re only paying half for it, which means the SE would cost $140 and the S7 $200 (or a little more for the larger sizes). I recommend the S7, as the larger display alone is worth $60 to me.",Others
2204,"I got a refurbished 6, seems like the 7 wasn’t much of an upgrade",Others

2206,Dang it kid save your money for college unless you're parents are rich?,Others
2207,The SE is litteral shit,Others
2208,"Just wondering, would you still have stuck with the 7 if you weren’t planning to use it as much?",Others
2209,"Ah okay, thanks for the honest opinion. I know the ECG and oxygen sensor aren’t important to me but just wondering would you consider the always on mode an important factor?",Others
2210,"Thank you for the in depth answer, just wondering did the upgrade overall feel worth it?",Others
2211,"Oh I didn’t know that, thanks, however I think I am mainly focused on other factors such as the screen size and always on mode.",Others
2212,"That’s good to hear as screen size is a key factor I’m thinking about, thanks for the info!",Others
2213,"Haha, I’m actually paying for half of it.",Others
2214,"It’s really not. My friend has an SE, upgraded from Series 3 and he is super content! But I respect your opinion",Others
2215,"I am wearing one right now, and I can confirm that it is in fact not literal shit.",Others
2216,"I would say if you’re not used to wearing a watch, the AOD is nice to have but not essential at all, and the SE is an excellent choice. I was quite happy with my S3 when I had it. But I’ve got used to having always-on now, and I’d absolutely miss it if I went back to a watch without it.",Others
2217,"Nope, you would barely notice it.",Others
2218,"Like i said I didn’t upgrade, sold the SE in july and bought this now, but I remember the SE and the exact experience, i can tell you the S7 is worth it if you can afford it without thinking twice about the money, and as a first watch yes, but for you like you said you don’t use your watch often, i would say the most important deciding factor for you is if you care about always on display or not.",Others
2219,Then those will be the only other two benefits you will gain from 7 to SE. aluminum on 7 has more color options so there’s there’s a minor consideration. Then there’s the faster charging option for the 7.,Others
2220,I don’t really want to drop 400 dollars on a Series 7 since I can’t or don’t need to use most of it’s features like ECG or blood oxygen. I want to get the Nike since it has more features without additional costs,Others
2221,Not really. I’m still learning how the thing works to be honest. I don’t think the o2 reader or the ecg are worth the additional cost for my context.,Others
2222,"I think this is the most sensible answer in this thread. The Always On Display is the killer feature as it means you don’t have to raise your wrist to tell the time or to see if it’s a notification that’s worth stopping and raising your wrist for. More importantly, some apps, like Workouts continue to display metrics when your wrist is lowered eg let’s say you’re riding a bike or running, glancing at your wrist while it’s down let’s you still see the data. On an SE the screen is off so you need to raise to see the info. 

If this feature matters to you, then look into Series 6. 

If it doesn’t matter then SE.",Others
2223,"Oh, that’s a shame, thank you though.",Others
2224,"Yes that is true, I think right now I’m focused on how important I find those factors as there aren’t too many reasons to go for 7.",Others
2225,That’s quite true and I probably won’t be needing it. I guess the main factors I’m concerned about are the screen size and always on mode.,Others
2226,"Ah okay, that’s something I’ll be thinking about, thanks.",Others
2227,Also the 7 has a slightly better chip. May not seem like much but I imagine future OS updates in the years down from now it would help. It also has U1 which SE doesn’t have. All may seem minor but just some specs to consider about.,Others
2228,"Actually, you get a bunch of exclusive Nike watch faces as well that are not available to be downloaded elsewhere.",Others
2229,"I guess different folks will feel differently about that. I know the 7 has more screen but using the se it doesn’t feel dated or that the screen is small for me. The idea of always on mode is nice n all but I don’t know why I would need my watch screen on when I’m not looking at it, the rise to look thing on the se when I tilt my wrist works really well and brings the screen on. If I had the 7 I think I would disable aod. We all have different use cases though so that might be very different to yours.",Others
2230,No problem. Generally speaking every Apple Watch is good for 3 years before really big new features are added (I’ve owned them since Series 0). Series 6 is from 2020 so you’re good till about Series 9 in 2023. Series 6 has exactly the same internals as a Series 7 minus fast charging.,Others
2231,"There seems to be. I visited the website u/DIL3MMA mentioned and Target will roll out a deal for the SE in both sizes, the 40mm being $219. Big shoutout my guy, thanks!

I was unsure but I can’t really justify $180 more for the s7 as I’m really just using this as a workout device and notification checker.",Others
2232,"That’s a good point, thanks.",Others
2233,And you get to choose the Nike bands at first purchase which I think are better (especially the sport loop),Others
2234,The S7 screen is nice but it definitely hasn’t made the S4-S6/SE design/screens feel immediately dated the way the S4 did to the S0-S3.,Others
2235,"Yeah, I guess I can see always on being irritating so I think I’ll do a bit more research on that. Thanks for sharing.",Others
2236,"How long until a slightly modified version is released as the OnePlus Watch?

If this would run the 4100 platform, it would be an instant buy for me. At 249€, I'll just wait for the first 4100 watches. The next Fossil most likely won't have it, but they might a revision later on that has 4100.",Others

I am only concerned about its battery life because my Apple Watch easily gets through a day and still has around 40-45% charge left. If Oppo watch is able to get through a day easily, then I feel it’s a total bang for buck. I would easily recommend it to a lot of my friends who are on Android.",Others

2273,Er no. 768MB ram is where the performance starts going up massively.,Others

So a better performing CPU, with better power efficiency is huge. It's why the Samsung and Apple watches work so well. (other than those platforms squashing background app CPU usage).",Others

I agree for the packaging, OK, but really not for the design of the watch. I think the Oppo is much much better than the AW design wise.",Others
2289,"So, the worst Wear OS watch still has a better Battery life with AOD than the AW.

And Samsung Active 2 can go for 3 days with AOD.",Battery
2290,"Yes. Ofc I do know that. But in terms of the smoothness of the OS, notifications swooping in at the right time, the haptic feedback on AW( this is just too big of a deal to me now- can’t go back ever) and other such small things made me just love AW more than these watches. WearOS tbh has a lot of potential in my eyes. Its just that Google hasn’t taken it seriously and realised its true potential. 
Samsung Active is more of a fitness watch rather than a true smartwatch. Yes I will agree it does all the things but the Tizen OS part just doesn’t have my attention. It infact repels me tbh given everything I have heard about it in terms of the poor app support on it.",Others
2291,"I have actually ordered from Amazon UK before, so maybe there are just restrictions on certain items? Or maybe it's more limited now due to the pandemic?",Others
2292,Interesting.... Guess I'll just sit back and see how it plays out then.,Others

2298,Thanks man!!  I'll do the same,Others
2299,"No. There are very clear differences between most of the round watches that make them clearly distinct designs. This Oppo watch is so heavily ""inspired"" by the Apple Watch design that arguing otherwise becomes ridiculous.",Others

2301,"Like what, the dials or buttons on the side? Like how apple has a dial and oppo has a button?  I get that they look alike... But to act like it's some big deal they are shaped the same is a bit ridiculous.  Look at the fossil 5 and Movado watch, they look identical.  Now, does it need to be an oval?  Have two buttons instead of 3?  The point is the total package, not just a shape.  So yeah, the outer design is inspired, or imitated.  Who gives a shit.",Others
2302,"Well not really. This is one of the finest smartwatches available, but the ecosystem is too closed, the battery life is not so good, there are practically no watchfaces to choose from (whitch is a complete dealbreaker for me) AOD is not good, armbands are proprietary and it's quite overpriced IMHO.",Others

2304,Well that’s basically Apple to be precise. They are known for being notorious for exercising control everywhere possible. AOD is ok for me at least. Cannot say about other’s experience though but I am fine with it. Same goes for the battery life. And obviously Apple being Apple they will keep their bands proprietary. Hell they haven’t phased out lightning ports on iPhone till now. Price wise - yes it’s overpriced. But then this is Apple. It’s not like I am trying to defend them here. But that’s how they have always been. They are just too focused on their revenues and they know that people are willing to shell out money (at least for now). So why not cash in on that opportunity. Every Apple product just seems overpriced tbh. But they are willing to keep it that way as long as people are paying.,Others
2305,Thanks! Do you know if it matters if we order from Germany vs the UK?,Others
2306,"I wouldn't summarize it better than you do.

The fact is when you compare with a Samsung Watch active 2 AND if you have a Samsung phone, the Active 2 seems a lot better in quite some aspects.

When you compare with a Fossil gen 5 ... no, please don't do it 😅😂🤣😂.

Apple devices are overpriced but you still can sell it for a good price. Other brands loose most of their value as soon as you open the box. So the price difference is not so bog that it looks.",Others

2337,"Updates have improved battery life for me. I also went through to make sure I had my notification settings set up as I like them which probably helped a bit too. 

I’m at 34% right now after 14 hours",Battery
2338,From the S3 it’s definitely worth an upgrade.,Others
2339,"Yeah, if I had a S4 there was no way I would have considered a S5.  That being said, going from a dirty S1, I appreciate the extra storage (did not get LTE) and the AOD.",Others
2340,I’m glad to have picked up a S4 now that it got cheaper. Hopefully S6 will be a noticeable upgrade next year.,Others
2341,"Something on macrumors had it saying people were complaining about battery life, so I think Apple is probably aware.",Others
2342,I’m at 15 hours off the charger right now with always on enabled and I’m also at 50%,Battery
2343,Do you have raise to wake on? With the always on display I turned that feature off and have found battery life to be much better that way. It’s also helpful to use less complications on the face you use wherever possible.,Battery
2344,I got my S5 on launch and I’ve been using Overcast without any issues. No watch before that so I can’t speak to previous models. watchOS 6.0.1.,Others
2345,"That's exactly why the always-on display isn't important to me. There are clocks everywhere, and in the few instances there isn't a clock around, I have to raise my wrist to see my watch anyway, so it defeats the purpose.",Others
2346,Well there wouldn’t be any real difference in usage. The display on s5 goes down to one refresh per second(which could technically handle a ticking second hand). But while using the watch it goes back to its native refresh which is what gives it that smooth animation.,Others
2347,Agree with this!,Others
2348,"Battery life depends heavily on how you use the watch. If I only use my S3 as a watch, I can get well into a third day. If I work out, listen to music, etc, I usually have to charge it every other day. or even overnight.",Battery
2349,"Yup, now at 14% at 21:20, been on since 06:00 and done a 15min workout. 

Looking forward to the S5 though, should last another 5 years at least.",Others
2350,Do u want AOD? If not then 4. If u want to shell out the extra cash and want AOD then s5.,Others
2351,"For <$200 I think I'd go with the S5. AOD (which you can always turn off it it's too much of a detriment), larger battery and a newer (read: new) product that will most likely be supported for slightly longer.",Others
2352,Still rocking my S1 here. Probably gonna pick up a S5 after I graduate cause mine has become incredibly slow. At least compared to the new ones.,Others
2353,Do you have the Space Black version or the grey version? How about the scratches? Just thinking about buying the titanium version but I have seen that is the most easy to scratch.,Others
2354,What is it that you enjoy now? Just curious because i'm on an S2 and i wonder what i would do more with an S5.,Others
2355,"I have aluminum, what’s the allure to ceramic? Just aesthetic?",Others
2356,"I mean clearly if you can afford a ceramic watch the question of ""is the upgrade worth it"" doesn't really apply to you. I think they were saying it's not worth the upgrade for people on a budget",Others
2357,"I second this. I also changed from series 4 gold SS to series 5 ceramic. If ceramic had been available in series 4, I would have gotten one. Always on display (AOD) was one of the major reasons I upgraded since I really wanted my AW behaves as a normal watch. The second reason was ceramic. I love the color and the most scratch resistance material.",Others
2358,Theatre Mode will disable Always On. I use this at night.,Others
2359,My theory is the S4 was supposed to do AOD but the display unevenness at low brightness meant they pulled the feature.,Others
2360,Upgrading from S3 or older? Get the S5. Already have the S4? Hold.,Others
2361,As a series 2 owner I am not disappointed at all - maybe I could have got an S4 but this watch is such an upgrade I have no buyers remorse. The AOD is nicer than I was expecting but the upgrade between the S2 and S5 is massive,Others
2362,"I was coming from S3 and was dead set on the series 5, but after it didn't have sleep tracking and didn't even have a new processor, I just got a used 4 for half the price",Others
2363,"It was also a great upgrade from the series 3!  Screen size alone made it worth it, but the always on is nice to have for workouts for sure.",Others
2364,I have S5 and I can tell you first Hand there’s hardly a difference in battery life having the display on or off. Maybe 20-30 mins at most.,Others
2365,"If you don’t need AOD, then the S4 would definitely be sufficient. The S5’s main upgrades are the AOD, built in compass, and 32gb storage (vs 16). Everything else is essentially the same, including processor speed. If you could find it for significantly cheaper than than the S5, I highly recommend it.",Others
2366,"Can confirm, going on 13 hours on my S5 rn at 44% with AOD on all day.",Battery
2367,Same. I’m at 59% after 11.5 hours off the charger.,Others

I’d likely be more on the “you’re using it a lot” side of things, but to me, my usage isn’t too unusual.",Others
2370,"I would want it to be at a full refresh rate while issuing, I would want to decrease the refresh rate of the always ok feature to preserve battery life.",Battery
2371,"You are totally right. My friend uses his watch more than a simple watch. Notifications, reading email, workout tracking during daily comute so the 3-4 days he gets are impressive. I get 2 days from my Gear S3 so S4 battery life is way better.",Others
2372,"Same, my battery performs very poor. S4 would be also a good choice since almost identical as S5 and it’s cheaper",Battery
2373,"That’s what my biggest gripe was, I loved my S2 but it gradually became slower. This happens over time so it’s not as noticeable but every now and then it would just bog down and I would just become frustrated.",Others
2374,Serious question: what's the point of the titanium version if it's the easiest to scratch? Pictures online make it look almost identical in appearance to the aluminum cases.,Others
2375,"I have the standard Titanium model and no scratches at all, that being said I’m also a cautious person but have bumped it a few times and dreaded looking at it because of everything I’ve heard. No scratches still.

It’s funny, people say that the standard Titanium model is the easiest to scratch yet my S2SS has micro abrasions out the wazoo even after a few days of ownership. My Titanium still looks like it just came out of the box.",Others
2376,"On my S2 there was always a notable loading time before I could do anything, like opening/using apps and using Siri. On the S5 everything happens almost instantly, so I actually started doing a lot of smaller things, like setting reminders, on my watch instead of picking up my phone. My S2 was mostly used for Activity Tracking and telling the time.",Others
2377,"Love the color and it's nearly impossible to scratch, plus it has the sapphire screen.",Others
2378,"I had very specific criteria for it being ""worth it."" Just because because I can afford doesn't mean I'm automatically going to buy it.",Others
2379,Yeah it does and I use it at night too but if your sleeve covers the watch it should turn it off anyway. No reason to switch theater mode on and off because it wastes battery in your sleeve,Others
2380,I do this at night. But an automatic complete darkness shift would be an awesome feature.,Others
2381,What kind of battery life do you get?,Battery
2382,"9to5Mac said the S5 is largely unchanged and has the same exact processor.

2385,"I will say this to your first point, after the most recent update to my phone’s OS (13.1.2), it seems like my watch battery life improved substantially. I wear from 7:00 AM to about 11:00 PM most days. Before the update, my watch would give me the low battery warning between 7:00 and 9:30 PM. After the update I’ve not seen it once.",Others
2386,Yeah it seems like the S5 is probably what they were shooting for when they started designing the S4 but then had to pull back on features due to time and cost constraints. I’m personally hoping the S6 is a nice leap from the S4/5 but given the lack of competition in the smart watch space not sure we will see much improvement.,Others
2387,"Yeah, I definitely considered that.  As a long time Apple customer, I have done similar things for Macs.  Just wait till the new MacBook Pro is announced and go buy previous model when prices are dropped. I know my sleep schedule is horrible, I don't need my watch to tell me.",Others
2388,I got about 14 hours on my S5 and I'm currently at 50% with AOD all day as well.  I also worked out today for 25 mins on a treadmill.  S5 Rocks!!!,Others

2391,It already does this? Maybe I’m misunderstanding what you’re asking.,Others
2392,"The promo material really doesn’t show off just how nice the stainless steel & titanium finishes are. The light clumps on the titanium in a unique way that gives it a very different look in person, also it doesn’t look as brushed as it looks in ads.",Others
2393,"I have the regular Ti one, so far so good. I don’t agree on the appearance, the Ti has a much different shine to it, the brushed finish is visible and it isn’t so white/silver like the Al models.",Others
2394,"This echoes my change in behaviour too, once I upgraded I found myself using my watch more because it's more efficient.",Others
2395,I second this too. The ceramic color stands out over all AW colors and it  is extremely gorgeous. I love the ceramic strength material which makes it the most scratch resistance.,Others
2396,I didn't say otherwise. I just think your criteria aren't necessarily aligned with what most people consider when deciding whether to upgrade.,Others
2397,"My battery life is abysmal as others have reported. I've got an open case with Apple support about it. I've also seen threads where beta testers for WatchOS 6.1 say that battery life is improved, so I'm holding out for that.",Others

2399,"This is not true. While the display uses the same tech, the controller hardware for efficiency/low power states necessary for always on display are not present in pre-Series 5 models.",Others
2400,"Did you watch the video? 2 minutes into the video MKBHD states that the always on display is a hardware feature, not software.",Others
2401,They’re not though. The Series 5 has a different screen controller in hardware that adjusts the refresh rate of the screen so you can have always on. The S4 doesn’t have this chip. There is also a U1 chip in the S5 that the S4 doesn’t have. So no they couldn’t offer this feature in software without depleting the battery in just a couple of hours.,Others
2402,"That’s good news. If they can optimize it to the point where it lasts just as long or longer than the S4 with AOD, I might get a second watch.",Others

2415,"That I don’t know. I would assume there’s a limit to minimum amount of times a panel can refresh in a second. I think the minimum is 1hz.

Edit: I think I see what you may be saying without putting it into correct terms. Maybe 1 refresh every 2 seconds. So it skips a second. Makes sense now.",Others

2423,"Yeah, sorry not very eloquent on it—very much a layman on the topic. The usefulness of an always on display that refreshes once every 30 seconds is, for all intents and purposes, the same as one that refreshes once a second.

I guarantee it's gonna come out that Apple had to redo the Series 6 with new firmware due to the issues with production.

2507,"I’ve gone in store and tried the S6, and I think the 41mm in graphite stainless steel is for me. I’m quite happy investing a little more into it as I plan on keeping it until it’s pretty much redundant - the titanium model was on my radar but anecdotal evidence doesn’t seem too compelling it’s worth that extra cost. It’s a lovely looking watch tho!",Others
2508,Do you have a guess as to how much the price of the 6 will go down? I have a 3 and my plan the whole time has been to wait for the 7 to come out to get a 6 lol,Others

2512,"I mean, we had a new blood O2 sensor, always-on altimeter, much better always-on display and more on the Series 6. In comparison, Series 7 is a joke",Others

Where are the 45mm bands that ""only fit the new watch body"". No one spends that much money on production unless it's gonna happen. The truth is something screwed up and they had to scrap it all in a panic to meet the deadline. Imagine the free fall Apple stock would  be in if it was announced that a watch design already in production with JIT parts orders were trashed. It's gonna come out. Mark my words. We will find out soon the other watch was supposed to be this year with a new processor and larger battery. Apple doesn't just have TSMC spend money making a new chip to toss it out. The new chip info was production info from TSMC. TSMC doesn't do stuff for free.",Others
2517,Actually the process is the same. It's all assembly line. No difference between any phone/smartwatch/tablet. It's all about putting the parts in the frame in order and using the tools that are preset to torque down the screws or apply the two sided adhesive films. Anyone who has done any electronics assembly work can do the job.,Others

According to a paywalled preview of a DigiTimes report accessed by MacRumors, next-generation Apple Watch models will adopt double-sided System in Package (SiP) packaging from Taiwanese supplier ASE Technology.

On its website, ASE Technology confirms that its double-sided technology allows for module miniaturization, paving the way for a smaller ""S7"" chip.

From ASE themselves.",Others
2550,"But honestly S4 and S5 chip were nearly identical too, and I guess Apple would rename S6 as S7 so the chip continues to match the Series number in the future",Others

2570,"If my current Watch broke, I would order a new one on the same day, so yeah, I think it's worth it. The hard part about explaining the appeal is that what I like about it is all the small things it does, all the time - for me, there's no singular killer feature that justifies it, but the sum of all the things make it worthwhile.",Others
2571,"For health features you could buy a Garmin or fitbit and this would give you some good health stats, especially the Garmins.
Where the Apple Watch shines is the deeper interaction with an iPhone.  Be selective with the notifications the watch receives and it is incredibly productive - no need to keep checking your phone for important notifications because you’ll have had them delivered discretely to the watch (haptic notifications are more subtle than the likes of garmin).
It’s nice for example to drop in walking directions in an unfamiliar city into your phone and let the haptics on the watch then guide you. Different taps for left and right and delivered at the point you need to turn.",Others
2572,"At first, I loved having all the features and notifications on my wrist. But I still found myself pulling my phone out for most things. Siri on my S3 became so slow and unresponsive that I flat out turned it off. I took the complications off my watch face except date and weather. I find myself wanting to disconnect more apps from my watch more often than I use them.  

It's a nice workout companion, especially if you can't bring your phone around with you when you do whatever you do. But for everyday wear, I really think I'll spend $400 toward a Hamilton or something nice instead of an S5 or S6.",Others
2573,Apple Watch series 3 onwards might be worth it. My series 0 wasn’t in my case but it was the first gen product.,Others
2574,"I was in Istanbul Airport, sitting myself in massage chair, and my iphone gone! Really fortunate that 5 airport staff find it one month later. Imagine having an Apple Watch, you spend 300-500€ not only for your watch, but essentially give boost to your apple exosystem and could save your iphone worth of +800€",Others
2575,It’s well worth it for the health features alone.,Others
2576,I wasn't into smart watches at all. I like watches to just tell time and that is it. I picked up a Apple Watch 5 because I wanted to be able to quickly without my phone control my house via homekit. Since I got the watch I love it. I don't use always on face and I get 3 days out of it before I need to charge it again. I have the wifi version not cellular also. I love how it shows me all my notifications and I love the stand and move. It is actually making me get up more via my IT job and I love that. It also works nice with maps and navigation where it will vibrate different when a different turn (left or right) is coming up and it just overall has been a great experience. I would say 100% get one if you have an iPhone and have other apple products because it just seamlessly syncs between them all.,Others
2577,"This is a weird one for me. I didn't need an Apple Watch, yet after I bought one to try, I can't live without it...",Others
2578,"I have one but am probably selling it. I’m pretty physically active so I don’t need  my watch to tell me my metrics other than using a stop watch for tracking my rest intervals. I hate notifications on my wrist as I’m trying to be more present with my kids and family. I know I can turn off notifications but it is just another thing I have to manage. Also I like to travel minimally but the Watch necessitates packing another unique cable. I purchased a $10 Casio F-91W and honestly have not missed my Watch at all. 

The only exception is music while I am at the gym. Now I have to carry my phone with me but that is not that big a deal as I carry my workout log, a pen and water bottle with me anyways.",Others
2579,It’s worth what I paid for a used one. It isn’t worth what they charge for it new. I’d say they’re about 50% overpriced.,Others
2580,"It’s worth it but don’t get the one with cellular data unless you are without your phone constantly or you like running and won’t take your phone with you

I like that I can connect my headphones straight to the watch and listen to music and the walkie talkie feature is also really fun!",Others
2581,"Well, I had the original Apple Watch (Series 0) since 2016 and while I enjoyed it a lot in the beginning, it was never supposed to last more than a couple years since the processor they had in it was a single core. And while the other generations of the watch looked cool, I didn’t feel it necessary to get them. But once series 4 dropped, I instantly wanted it cause that shit looked sexy as hell but still decided to wait it out till series 5 and finally upgraded from my dying series 0 to the series 5 a couple months ago. And well, maybe it wasn’t for me but I honestly felt that I was doing perfectly fine with my old series 0 and I wasn’t really benefiting much from the power and tech that’s in the latest watch and honestly, the price also made me question the purchase (being a college student will make you question every single dollar you spend lol). So I’m returning it and sticking with my trusty series 0 for a year or maybe even a couple more. So in short, I’d say it isn’t worth its asking price but if you can get one for a decent discount, then why not go for it.",Others
2582,"I tried it, but it wasn't for me. I don't like checking my phone often so yeah.",Others
2583,Eh.  Never made the must have list here.,Others

2585,"I didn’t “need” an Apple Watch until I went out and bought one. It has taken care of so many tiny/simple problems for me that if I lost it now, I would be running into multiple inconveniences everyday. I’m a forgetful college student, so for me 1) the feature that allows you to set off a ring/tone on your phone so you can hear and find it is a LIFESAVER 2) I like to have my phone put away so I can be present while I’m in class, out with friends, etc. Being able to read a text preview on my watch the second it arrives is really nice and allows me to see what people are saying but decide to respond at a later, more appropriate time if it’s not urgent. If you have the money, get one, it’s a game changer. If it’s not affordable, eh. You won’t know what you’re missing. I bought mine from Apple refurbished, been a few years I can’t remember what series but I haven’t had any problems with slowness or glitching.",Others
2586,This thread wont be good for my wallet,Others
2587,"I sold mine. 

Bought the S0 on release day and gave it back to Apple.

Tried again with a S3 LTE on release day as well.
It was pretty nice. I could go to the gym without my phone, just the watch and AirPods. The issue was battery and speed. So often it would hang, so often the battery wouldn’t allow me my full routine at the gym. But it was still pretty nice.

I’ve enjoyed it for one year, then as soon as I stopped going to the gym, I had zero use for it.  

You have to cater a lot to your watch. And it’s slow to do pretty much anything IMO. I know the latest series are faster, but can’t really speak about that.",Others
2588,Have had my Series 2 for 3+ years and it’s one of the greatest purchases I’ve ever made.,Others
2589,"I have been using my GPS Series 3 since launch every day, I use it when running and lifting to track my workouts and it also gets everyday use for not getting my phone out to control music/see texts/ whatsapp/ weather/etc.
Battery life is still good I use it to track workouts for over an hour and a half each day, half of them with GPS, and I still get over 50% battery before charging every night.
So in my case, totally worth it and one of the best Apple products I have owned.",Battery
2590,I think so. I was of the mindset that I didn’t need one until a friend loaned me his old one when he upgraded. Now when I forget to charge it or don’t wear it I’m finding I miss it.,Others
2591,"I never use it other than to track my sleep and use Gymaholic for workouts. I wear it every single day. Never go anywhere without it. I’d say it’s worth it if you are very active, otherwise don’t bother.",Others
2592,"I got a Series 3 as a gift a few years ago. To me, it’s just a nice thing to have (for workouts, for notifications, for its sleek look with the Milanese Loop Band). It’s not an absolute necessity for me. I’m certainly glad I have it! But would I spend my own money to buy one? Maybe not. And when I’m not wearing my Apple Watch, I’m wearing a regular ol’ analog watch",Others
2593,"Having a smart watch makes life a little more convent. I work with pesticides and instead of having to interrupt  my entire work flow and de-glove to answer a phone call or message I can handle that on the watch with my ""clean hand"" or even my nose in a pinch. The workout tracking helps me monitor how active I am during the day and the whole ""closing your rings"" activity tracking is addictive. I can see how these help people lose weight and remain active. Also, the series 4 and 5 have ekg abilities for those conscious and curious abo8t heart activity. The most important thing as it pertains to safety for me is the fall detection. I work all over the place and if anything happened to me it automatically contacts emergency services. I'd say it's worth it. If you're that curious and don't want to pay full price try a site like swappa for really good deals on new/used watches. I picked up a mint series 4 stainless for well under current model prices. You can even find older models for well under $200.",Others
2594,"You're asking on this sub, so you probably  expect to hear positive things...

I got it to track my swimming workout, and splurged on the LTE version because the ability to take calls without my phone would potentially be helpful. I haven't really used that very much, but it's nice to have.

What I actually wind up using it for is to check the weather and set timers, and I seem to do those multiple times per day and it's very convenient for that. I also get my text notifications on it. All of these save me pulling out my phone. I still  carry my phone, but with a toddler it's nice to be able to do things virtually  hands-free.",Others
2595,"I don't think it's worth purchasing a brand new one. That being said, I recently got mine (used but great condition) and I really like it so far. I just got it so I could get DeltaTrainer, a workout tracker that analyzes your form and pairs you with a real trainer. So far both have been going great",Others
2596,yes. in my experience it’s best for notifications and directions from maps,Others
2597,"I had every Apple Watch up to and including series 4. Decided it wasn’t what I wanted from a watch. Charging it every single day was a hassle, always wondering why my battery life was shit, Siri being unresponsive, AirPods sometimes pairing to phone instead of watch and vise Versa. Ended up getting a Garmin instead. 2 week battery life, heart rate monitor, GPS. I don’t think I’ll go back.",Others
2598,Other then working out part I’d say no,Others

2600,It doesnt work too well with any Android smartphone I own. :(,Others
2601,"I just love the convenience of it. Seeing exact calories burned is pretty neat. Recording workouts with it. Starting music from it without taking out your phone. Temperature and weather conditions at a glance is great. I’ve gone probably less than 5 days without wearing it since I got my S3 almost two years ago. $200 for a new S3 straight from Apple is a steal, it’s got everything you’d need in a smart watch. I’d say it’s worth it, something I use every day without fail.",Others
2602,The Apple Watch is the true ball and chain of the ecosystem and it’s absolutely worth it. Apple Pay on the wrist makes for an easy life. Workout competitions with friends get me moving more. Not checking my phone for every single notification.,Others
2603,Honestly apart from looking good (but always anxious about scratching your glass screen) and looking at the time/calories burnt/sleep tracking. I did not in the slightest felt it helped me much. I sold both my s2 and s3 after a few months of using it. It doesn't feel like its a product that one would need at the moment. It isn't yet at its prime i believe. Apple needs to convince us more as to why we should get it.,Others
2604,"It’s great being able to leave your phone on silent but still know every message/phone all because of a little buzz on your wrist, the same when driving or cycling when using maps, knowing a turn is coming up without having to constantly look at the display of your phone/CarPlay is great. I never wore a watch before the Apple Watch and I’m 5 years in now.",Others
2605,"I use it so I can go swim for an hour, chill in the hot tub and take calls when I’m critically required to do so for work. That’s the only reason I have one, but it’s a pretty compelling use.",Others
2606,I use the Watch for 95% of all my payments. It’s so convenient. That alone makes it worth it. Add to that all the other amazing stuff it does.,Others
2607,"I paid $150 for my S1 and cannot see myself paying regular price for this thing.    sure it's interesting to get stats on my activity and sleep but it's all just fluff for me, nothing life changing.",Others
2608,It's so useful to not have to pull out my phone to do most of what I want to do now. I am even typing this on my watch right now.,Others
2609,Hell yeah it is. I like it just as a neat digital watch!,Others
2610,"For me it’s worth it as it works way better than my old Fitbit, you can see a lot of info at a glance, you don’t have to pull out your phone to use Siri, can change music easily, check notifications, make phone calls, and it can be set up to track irregular heartbeats.   

I’m trying to get into shape again but my heart isn’t in the best shape and the other day said my heartbeat was irregular. I checked on my omron blood pressure monitor to verify and my diastolic and systolic numbers were high. I had to take a pill to get them back to normal. If i didn’t have this watch I’m not sure i ever would have known and who knows what could have happened. It’s nowhere near as accurate as a cuff or chest blood pressure monitor, but you can’t wear those all the time.",Others
2611,Do you exercise enough and want something more? If not then it isn’t worth it.,Others
2612,"What I’ve experienced is that its difficult to explain why it’s worth it until you’ve started to use it. For some it’s a big purchase and I’ve had several friends say, it’s too much, it can’t really be that worth while. It isn’t until they’ve started to use it that they find value in the watch in their own unique way.

Overtime what I find valuable in the watch has changed. From using it for notifications and not having to take my phone out, skipping songs, now to exclusively being a fitness watch and wearing it every day regardless if I workout because I’ve grown accustomed to having it on my wrist every day. If it broke tomorrow, I would go straight to Apple store to fix it. I lost my workout band a few weeks ago. I was scrambling at 8pm to see where I can go to buy a band so I can use it for my workout the next morning.

TLDR; it’s worth it but it’s difficult for me to explain why it’s worth it until you’ve started to use it for awhile.",Others
2613,"i’m in the ecosystem already, so i’m bias, but i really love my apple watch. i’ve only had it for about a month or so, but it has def been a plus for me. the biggest thing is that it keeps me off my phone. i like being able to respond to a message from my phone or (most of all) controlling my music, podcasts, & volume from it. also, as someone who isn’t as active as i would like, the activity tracking does help push me more, whether during a workout or just day to day. i got it for christmas, but i would pay for one if i had to. also i have the GPS version. i didn’t need the cellular.",Others

2615,"Incredibly worth it if you’re active; if you have medical insurance through your employer, check and see if they will reimburse the cost of a base model Watch.",Others
2616,"My 2 cents: It's a great product but you got to see how much friction it adds to your life. I had the series 0,2,3,4. They all ended up being sold. Reason? All the activity features, notifications and whatnot weren't really making up for: having to charge it every day, having to bring one more charger/cable (and therefor have multiple devices charging in different points of a hotel room) with you wherever you might stay more than a day and last but maybe the most important part, there is still no screen that has the same ""under the sun"" visibility as a classic mechanical watch.",Others
2617,"No, it isn't. It's a gimmick, at least for me. Grab yourself a regular watch instead",Others
2618,I’ve owned 3 of them but this S4 might be my last. I should be more active and I do walk/jog the dogs but I never use the watch correctly for it. I like it for notifications but I still pick up my phone so it just isn’t worth it for me.,Others
2619,I use a fit bit blaze for all the features you mentioned 200$ the apple watch makes calls and  takes pictures more than I would ever want my watch to do. Blaze also tracks my sleep which is very helpful,Others

She never wears it in the house because she’s always near her Mac or her phone, but she’ll definitely be wearing when we’re out and about. If I asked her, she’d say it was worth it, but I definitely do not want one. In the end it’s value/use is going to be super subjective.",Others
2622,"Allows me to keep my phone in my pocket, complications are super useful and fully customizable, time is dead accurate, control my sound system anywhere in my house, great for the gym and swimming. Oh, and it tells the time.

Long story short, I can’t go back to a dumb watch.",Others
2623,apple employee here: worth it if you regularly work out,Others
2624,"If you can afford it, it’s totally worth it. I use it for notifications, fitness tracking, timers, and Apple Pay mostly. If you’re on the fence, get an older model and see how much you like it.  I also have complications on my watch face so I can see the weather and S&P 500 at a glance.",Watch Face

2626,Other than for tracking exercising I found it pretty worthless. It still needs a phone to update apps and isn’t a true stand alone device yet. When it gets there then perhaps it will prove it’s utility. I don’t have the latest version so is it there yet? The one I have lives a drawer 95% of the time.,Others
2627,I was never into smart watches either until I got my first one,Others
2628,"I can’t get used to anything you wear. Tried the watch and it feels like a handcuff to me. Tried AirPods and they felt like ear weights. I guess I’m just a phone guy. As much as I love tech, I’m not for wearing it.",Others
2629,"I use mine constantly. My hands are often in gloves or greasy, so it’s a life saver when I get a bunch of texts, calls, etc. I went nearly a year without one after my Series 0 died, really missed having it. But as the top comment says: I wouldn’t put myself in the red to have one.",Others
2630,"I bought a series one, had it till the series 4 came out and upgraded.. Not Cellular for both... use it for responding to messages with voice and music changes throughout the day, calculator app is handy, glancing at stills from camera alerts at the house, weather data checks, reminders/notifications, translation app came in handy a few times, SoundHound as it’s quicker to identify a song without pulling out my phone, all of my wallet purchases at Starbucks and the workplace food market, and the gas stations with the tap to pay, as well as lots of other few time apps uses.. I found it to be essential in my life now and can’t imagine wearing any of my regular watches from my collection, Aside from the pocket watches on the special occasions (but still wear the AW4 as well lol)  my wife is in the same spot, however she also has a workout routine which she also tracks data with her watch4 also.  Gets plenty of use.  I was worried I was going to damage it at work, so I was wearing a snap on screen cap over my series 1 at work as a carpenter/heavy vehicle parts handler for awhile before I realized the cheap plastic screen protector wasn’t taking any damage or scuffs so I stopped worrying about that, every time I smack it or rub it on anything I expect a scuff but never anything.  It’s extremely handy to not pull my phone out at work, as leadership can Hawkeye ya with a phone... worth every penny.",Others
2631,"I really like the fitness stuff.  Other than that, it's a neat gadget.   It doesn't do anything life changing for me, but I like it.  I like notifications for things that I don't get a lot of notifications from, but I turned them off for things like facebook  messenger where the notifications were annoying.",Others

2634,Can't ever use a dumb watch again.,Others
2635,"i shit on apple a lot, but i really do like the watch. the only reason i sold mine is because when i get sweaty at work i hate the way the watch feels on my wrist. i know thats a dumb ass sounding thing to say, but i never could find a band that fit my wrist and felt comfy no matter what.",Others
2636,"I find it one of the nicest, most impressive bits of Apple tech, but not ‘essential’.

If you consider it like an iPhone ‘nano’ with shitty battery life it’s fantastic. iMessage voice to text is incredible, Apple Pay, run tracking whilst listening to podcasts, etc... I can often just leave phone at home if not out all day.",Others
2637,Mine just sort of irritates me. I bought it two years ago and it was OK for about six months but since then it’s just gotten gradually slower to the point of frustration. I use it only for tracking my runs and checking the time now and use my iPhone for everything else because it’s much faster.,Others
2638,Yup I love mine. Had a S2 that I gave to my sister when I upgraded to a S4 bc I wanted a bigger screen. My favorite app on the watch that I say is a game changer from any Samsung Gear/Fitbit is the Apple Maps integration. Turn by turn direction with Taptic reminders on which direction to turn is great. Nothing else can match that that I’ve seen so far and it’s a perfect feature to never get lost or make a wrong turn/miss an exit.,Others
2639,"Its nice to have but not necessary. Use it for music, notifications, and messaging.",Others
2640,Eh. It’s a toy not a tool. If you have extra money go for it. I wear mine every day and it’s just a  notification mule,Others
2641,Weird question but are the series 5 Nike bands different than the series 2 Nike bands?  I recently upgraded and the new band feels thicker and more rigid. Wondering if it’s just cuz it’s new.,Others
2642,"For years I dreamed of buying a luxury watch, but couldn’t wrap my head around the cost. I waited as long as the release of the Series 2 to buy the Apple Watch, and never regretted it. I’ve only ever bought the one and it’s still ticking. I will confess to being fully imbedded into the Apple ecosystem, and has done as advertised by way of becoming part of daily life.

Long lasting, aesthetically gorgeous, and easily integrated with other Apple products under your direct control. That is what’ll make it worth it. A product to have just to have, maybe not so much.",Others
2643,My watch (4) best thing i ever bought. Worth every penny. Leaving phone at home is fab.,Others
2644,"I've always been a ""watch"" guy, so I like wearing watches. I had the first Apple Watch and thought it was okay, but it was slow and I didn't find the functionality too compelling. Fast forward to my S5, and I think it is an amazing device. I don't think I could live without it, especially the fitness tracking and the ability not to be tethered to my iPhone.",Others
2645,"It's the best piece of tech I own, including my pride and joy gaming pc, and I own a lot of tech.

A lot.",Others
2646,"I absolutely hate the fact that battery replacements out of warranty are prohibitively expensive. 
I got a cheap Garmin Forerunner just for GPS and heart-rate tracking. I can’t replace the battery there either, but at least it’s only 80 bucks instead of 300.

I wouldn’t mind paying 80 bucks every three years - but not over 200. That’s insane.",Battery
2647,"As owner I wouldn't recommend it. After initial good impressions, at the end of the day the only feature that's gamechanging for me is paying with watch. Other stuff is very usual - notifications, checking weather and setting up timer.

For the activity tracking, it's mostly annoying and builds up a dark pattern of feeling really bad if you've build 60 day streak and then went to a party and slept a lot, you couldn't do the 12 hours on feet chalenge. Also annoying when the app tells you to ""start"" trakcing walking - this isn't something you want to do, should be seamless - maybe it is if u turn it off but the app doesnt tell you that.

But the worst part is that it doesnt look good.",Others
2648,Yes. A million times yes.,Others

But I can afford it and it makes my day better. so yea",Others
2655,"Why get a smartwatch if you use it passively, as you say? A fitness tracker from other brand are lighter, last you a week and benefit from third-party apps to continuously feed its data to Apple Health if you so desire (on top of the trackers already working great with your iPhone)",Others

2660,"This is so true. Unlike the AirPods (which I consider similar to the Apple Watch in so far as you don't NEED it), it's hard to say that you use this product everyday. I usually like to explain that I actively notice when I'm not wearing it, and wish that I was wearing it.",Others
2661,"This. I hate my Apple Watch b/c it's another item I would replace instantly if it's lost or broken ;) 

I didn't wear a watch prior, and got a Series 2 on sale one day to check it out. I have a series 4 now and only take it off to charge. I use it for fitness tracking, alerts, and quick info. Good thing about the watch is I don't feel the need to get each new version. Every other version seems like a good cadence.",Others
2662,"As much as a hate to admit it, you’re totally right. Anytime I don’t fill the rings the watch never ceases to remind me that I’m not quite where I should be lol",Others

I’ve never thought of it like that before but yeah, since the first day the Apple Watch was in the hands of the public, I’ve had one on my wrist!",Others

2666,"> this would give you some good health stats, especially the Garmins

Not health stats, but sports stats. My Garmin Fenix 3 HR is 4 years old and yet I don't see any non-Garmin watch that could surpass it.

So yeah, if you're serious about sports, Garmin is the only way. There were some news article of a guy who ran a marathon with Apple Watch, but the sole fact that this is an article-worthy thing should tell you a lot.",Others

2677,"Yeah the estimated bill of materials is like 1/4 of the retail price (at least for the original model). There's some cool functionality for techies, but it's an unneeded luxury for most people (I'm still using a Series 1 that I bought when the Series 2 came out)",Others

2682,"Thank you so much for your insight. You see, this is what I am afraid of, that after the honey moon I might just set it aside. I do have a Tissot Watch which is very elegant which is why I am thinking twice before making the jump on to the Apple Watch as I am not in a good financial position now after having had bought my iPhone 11 Pro and MacBook Pro 16 if you know what I mean.",Others

2684,"my bad, lemme fix that",Others
2685,"Now that I read all the comments here, I only want the cellular version which means I can leave my phone at home and head to the gym with nothing in my pocket and be able to pay for stuff and listen to music! That's amazing.

Also, you touched on a great point where you mentioned the convenience of not having to pick up your phone every time to check a notification. You see, while I am doing cardio and listening to Audible with my phone in my pocket, if I get a notification I have to stop and take out the phone to see what's the notification then put it back. I can imagine simply checking the watch will save me a lot of that hassle.",Others
2686,"About 4GB for the series 3, I think they have slightly more now",Others
2687,"If you get the cellular version and have Apple Music you can stream all of your music without the phone. Or as long as you're within bluetooth range it'll stream directly from your phone I think. I current have the cell version so I don't remember what the storage is but when I had the standard Series 0 it had plenty of space for a pretty long playlist on it (I never filled it up). 

I love it (paired with AirPods or other wireless headphones) for exercising without the phone. Also (I've had one since late 2015), the most other uses I've got out of it is setting quick timers, notifications, and a much more reliable siri(at least in my experience) compared to the phone.",Others
2688,Never got into wearing normal watches.  Got a S0 and suddenly can’t leave the house without it.,Others
2689,Probably not possible on r/apple,Others

2696,"I got a series 3 for Christmas and I love this thing. It’s helped me get my sleep back on track and it yells at me enough to get my ass up and moving that I’m noticeably slimming down. It’s stupid that a little spinning thing in a watch screen helps, but it does.",Others

2701,Gymaholic for me. Love it.,Others
2702,"Nah if my AirPods broke I’m automatically buying more and collecting them the same day. going back to wires sucks more than not having a smart watch imo. All the watch does is be a small phone on my wrist, albeit very well.",Others
2703,Rings are my life now,Others
2704,"They all do stand nagging, badges as well as the body battery etc so casual health stats as well as sports stats.
You’re right about marathons though - I do the odd ultra (walking) and have a separate watch to record this which has a very long battery life. It’s one less fuss to worry about when you’re getting tired after 20 odd hours and wondering whether it’ll die on you.
That does remind me though - I’m old school and have worn a watch for 40 years. I have small wrists and the fenix 1 I had used to hurt no end. The Apple watches (on my third now, from s0) have been the most comfortable I’ve ever worn.",Others
2705,They say this every year. The truth is Apple massively slows every model down with updates. S2 for example was lightning fast at launch and is now a piece of junk. Same thing is kind of happening to S4.,Others
2706,"Absolutely. 

The cellular one means you’re paying additional $ each month for likely very little gain (unless you would leave your phone behind quite often).",Others

2709,This is so out of touch and ignorant.,Others
2710,"At the same time, $400 (or $200 for the budget/older model) for a device you use daily, lasts 3+ years, and is half the price of a phone isn't terrible. It's not cheap, but compared to other tech products it's certainly not expensive.",Others
2711,If you’re seriously comparing raw material cost with retail prices you should brush up on some basic economics.,Others
2712,"Well, I mean, my point’s not that they make a profit or anything like that. I think of it in terms of utility. If they couldn’t make it for a cent less, it wouldn’t change my position: I get about two hundred bucks’ worth of utility out of it. I don’t get four hundred bucks’ worth of utility out of it. How much they make on each unit isn’t my concern.",Others
2713,And the nice thing is that it's available for other camera apps to use as well.,Others
2714,"I have a cellular S3, and I can confirm it is nice to be able to leave my phone at home, or because my 6s+ battery was crap, I could leave my phone in my truck to charge while out and about, and still be able to stay connected. I upgraded to the 11PM, so I don't have to worry about phone battery life anymore lol",Others
2715,"If I still ran or biked that would be a huge win. I don't do either of those so it's more so I don't have to carry my phone around the house or on a walk around the neighborhood, or can leave it in my locker at the gym. It does cost like $10/month through Verizon for that extra  feature, though, so that may factor into your decision.",Others
2716,"Yeah the cellular model is amazing ! I forgot to mention the music stuff ! Also I love that every cashier I interact with looks at me like I’m a wizard, paying with my hand and all xD 

Yep, when I go running I can just quickly look at it and only stop for important stuff ! It’s so convenient",Others
2717,more than enough to put my favorite songs. Thanks for clarifying that.,Others
2718,So if I get the GPS version only it can stream music from the Spotify on my iPhone directly where I an keep the iPhone a few feet away from me while I workout?,Others
2719,"It has an e-SIM, so it basically forwards all calls and texts to the watch. Correct, it'll work on its own even if the iPhone is powered off (Calls and iMessages only and any apps that work completely independently; SMS messages do NOT work with the phone powered off or not on wifi and nearby). With the iPhone powered on and connected to wiFi, you can leave the phone at home and EVERYTHING will mirror to the watch, regardless of where you are with your watch.

So every day I leave my iPhone at home, powered on and connected to WiFi. So I get all notifications on my watch, and in some cases, I can even reply to messages (Signal, Microsoft Teams to name a couple) via voice dictation even though neither have Apple Watch apps.",Others
2720,"Yes, definitely. Especially since it’s precise.",Others
2721,Then when do you charge it?,Battery
2722,I second that! Been using auto sleep for a week and it’s the best hands down!,Others
2723,"They’ve done studies where subjects all slept the same certain amount of time, but they changed the clocks to make some of them think they slept less than they actually did. Just that difference of information impaired their performance that day (because they thought they slept less).  Or it was reversed, not entirely sure (don’t quote me). But there is credibility to what you’re saying!

Happy cake day!",Others
2724,Keep in mind it’s not even a accurate sleep tracker. It has zero way of knowing how long you spend in each sleep stage. It uses movement and potentially heart rate to guesstimate your sleep quality. Doesn’t have an SP02 sensor either.,Others

2727,"I’d definitely replace my wireless buds or headphones if that happened, but Airpods are similar to other mid to high end True wireless options on the market.  There doesn’t seem to be anything close to an Apple watch in terms of wearable app integration across so many categories, but headphones just pair, play audio, have a mic, and activate voice assistant, all with some touch or button controls- only the seemless pairing is proprietary to Airpods as a standout feature iirc.",Others

You're the one who should be providing some evidence to back that up, otherwise I'm sticking to my stance which is that your comment is utter nonsense. If the Apple Watch was truly FIFTY PERCENT overpriced, they wouldn't be flying off the shelves and Apple would be forced to drop the price in order to move them. Middle school economics.",Others

2764,"Because it’s a Watch and not an OS review? Those things are related and he does mention a couple points where Watch OS 6 plays a role (noise measurement is also availible on older watches and he still mentions it) but if you expected a Watch OS review you just watched the wrong video. Honestly, I don’t know why you did, especially since none of the new features fundamentally change what the Apple Watch is or how it behaves, you know, things that would be actually relevant for an Apple Watch review.

Watch OS 6 has tons of quality of life improvements and little (non-central) feature additions and all of that is nice but listing them all (or even many of them) within an Apple Watch review is, well, it’s just not necessary or what one would expect.",Others
2765,I am coming from Android (Galaxy S9+ and Galaxy Watch) so I am not super familiar with the icons. The list mode with the name next to it definitely helps me.,Others
2766,I use other watch faces purely as shortcut launchers only so I can avoid the blob UI.,Others
2767,It’s one of the must beautiful app pickers I’ve ever seen but equally obnoxious to actually use. Really the epitome of Apple’s mid-2010s design era.,Others
2768,I actually didn't even think about this when using mine. I can totally turn off the wrist raise activation and just wake it with the dial/crown.,Others
2769,"Holy shit this may be the solution, I have a S5 sitting at home and I can’t wait to get home and try it out but it’s been very offputting with all the talks about battery life",Others
2770,Thanks for the great idea!  I'll have to give this a shot and see how I like it.,Others
2771,"No. Apple introduced an audio streaming API in watchOS, but Spotify still hasn't used it. The Spotify app on the Apple watch only lets you control Spotify on other devices (including your phone).",Others

2775,"No. It’s just a software issue in watchOS 6.0

It’s working fine in Beta 6.1",Others
2776,It really shouldn't have much of an impact. Plenty of smartwatches in recent years managed it with negligible impact and Apple's got their special 'low power screen' with a much slower refresh rate compared to those.,Others
2777,No it didn’t,Others
2778,"My difference is around 20-30%.  I’m not regretting getting a series 5 over 4, but it is disappointing that one of the distinguishing features hurts the battery life this much. It’s not hard to turn the AOD off so it’s not something that is a deal breaker. I’m coming from a Galaxy Watch and while I like the Apple Watch more, the battery life on the Samsung is excellent. I also like the looks of the Galaxy Watch more since it looks more like a traditional watch, but the Apple Watch’s rectangular shape is definitely better as a touch screen.",Others

2788,But no one will come back on their review because it doesn't generate enough clicks,Others
2789,Had the gear sport before the series 5. It was a much better looking watch. But so far I’m finding the series 5 a little nicer to use day to day.,Others

2791,"He is unpopular here because he doesn't kiss Apple's ass like say iJustine does at every Apple item. People are way too sensitive here.Above you there is a comment complaining about his review of the 11 because MKBHD said why there is the notch still here or that big, it's a legitimate complain, it's the same design on the 3rd iteration, but people see it as an attack to their beloved brand.",Others
2792,He's unpopular because he doesn't dive into every feature of Apple products that help the fanboys around here justify their new purchases. Features that won't be used by 99% of people.,Others

Very clearly referring to the other already-existing solutions (pop-up cameras, etc). Not that I think they could/would have done it anyway, seems pretty mechanically stressful for the pop-up camera to go up every time you unlock the device.",Others
2796,"I've got a very particular situation. I went through a few stretches where my right hand and/or arm had bad nerve pain, so I've learned to use both mice and trackpads ambidextrously. My hands *really* hate the Magic Mouse (and a lot of other mice), so I use a Surface Mouse (the only mouse I've found that I can use consistently without pain), and I mostly use the trackpad for scrolling or for when my right hand needs a break. 

I use a lot of art and design apps, so being able to pan and zoom quickly and without contorting my hands is essential (scrolling a lot with a scroll wheel and occasional modifier key starts to hurt, whereas I can scroll in any direction all day with a trackpad). That, and sometimes using the trackpad just plain feels nicer (especially on a smaller screen or work area).",Others
2797,i believe he uses for editing and stuff on final cut like with gestures. You can do **a lot** more with the trackpad than the mouse for certain use cases.,Others

I actually got a lot of compliments from Apple Watch owners for how it looked more like a classic watch and the spinning bezel was always a Wow factor. 

I think the Apple Watch is pretty and pretty great in use but if I had a fancy dinner party (not gonna happen) I’d definitely pick the gear sport to blend in more with the traditional mechanical watch crowd.",Others
2804,"Cheap Looking? 

Is the Kool-Aid still tasty? It's been 10 years since I've seen this logic applied to a competitor product.",Others
2805,"> cheap looking

Well that's just not true is it.",Others
2806,"Indeed, it can do. Samsung went to a really big extreme when they did it with their Note series, and Apple still would need more space than just a camera for their Face ID tech so it would be possible to get a compromise.",Others

2808,I bought mine in November and am happy with it,Others
2809,"If you can spring for the se I think it’s generally faster, but at the core, they do the same thing. If you want a budget option to get into Apple Watch, the series 3 is a good bet.",Others
2810,Yes. I was debating the se or 3. I eventually went with the 40 mm se but it took me like a week to decide after seeing reviews and my needs.,Others
2811,"One thing to take into account is the memory of the watches. I believe the serried 3 has 8gb while the SE has 32gb. I work at a target and a few people I know with the series 3 have said that they can run out of memory and have to remove some things. 

So factor in that the SE has three times the memory too",Others
2812,Get the se just for the screen it’s a game changer,Others
2813,"i think it's a fine fitness-centric watch when you can get it for $120-130 USD, but at the $200 USD msrp, i feel you can do better (Garmin 245, 645 or Vivoactive 4, for example). not sure what Canadian prices are like for those, though",Others

2838,Superb thank you so much,Others
2839,Thanks for the excellent review. Anyone who has troubles in cable management or is willing to try a handy apple watch charger should not miss the Dongle!,Others
2840,"Interesting read! Thanks for sharing. Definitely a more unique use case.

Your comment about “scrubbing your run” got me curious so I checked... The Nike Run Club app has that feature (and I’m sure others as well). But yeah, it is kind of annoying how minimal the built-in workouts app is.",Others
2841,"I know you don’t want another app but WorkOutDoors is amazing for some of the things you want and listed above. I literally take the time after every workout to see where my heart rate was high (in correlation to the workout map). What the zone was. Elevation. Etc. it’s 5.99 once and turned my watch into a data machine. 100% worth it and I never buy paid apps. There are plenty of people who agree if you search for the app and reviews. I was hesitant to buy it, but so happy I did. Recommended to my brother and he loves it as well. Cheers!",Others
2842,"What made you choose an Apple Watch over, say, a Garmin? You don’t really seem to be taking advantage of most of what the watch can do, so I’m curious why you didn’t get something more specialized to your use case.",Others
2843,AW is very mediocre as a workout watch – Garmins are much better,Others
2844,"As for those of you who are saying that it would've been smarter to buy a cheaper, running-focused watch: by and large, you're probably right. However, the point I was trying to make is that my top priority was to have a watch that would be 100 % reliable and headache-free (especially when it comes to GPS and syncing), not getting the best bang for the buck or the most feature-rich running watch per se. 

Personally, I do not feel like I overpaid one cent and am completely happy with my purchase. I understand that most other people probably would not feel this way, but I'm extremely picky with stuff not working as they should (as the Airport Express anecdote, I hope, makes clear).",Others
2845,"Nice. I think at you’re case, I can say there are excellent alternatives at cheaper price and high quality. Amazfit watches are excellent these days, or even Huawei. Yes you could use a less than 100$ Amazfit Bip S for that purpose effectively.",Others
2846,A Coros Pace running watch with far longer battery life and priced around $200 would have been a better buy compared to barely using any of the Apple Watch functionality.,Others
2847,"Thanks for this, really useful! I’m just about to order an SE for just running and workouts. Have you used Strava on the SE?",Others
2848,Same boat as OP.  I had a series 2 AW but the battery is not lasting even half a day and its freezing up and I mostly use it for working out and running.  I actually picked up a Garmin VivoActive 4 to try out but one thing I didn't realize is that with the Garmin in order to transfer your paid Apple music over to the watch internal storage you have to have a PC/Mac and send it over with itunes and Garmin express.  The fact that I don't own a PC now its all Ipads/Iphones makes it a no-go.  I usually like to run without my phone so I like to have music stored on the watch.  I'm starting to lean now on picking up an Apple watch SE and use it strictly for running/working out like the OP.  The nice thing with the AW if you already have a iphone is how seamlessly it just works.  The garmin is very nice and seems to find GPS quickly but it doesn't quite meet my needs.,Others
2849,"Yeah, the Polar Flow app (which sounds like a meteorological app for tracking the melting of ice-caps but isn't) had this, which is why I more or less assumed Apple's app would, too, I guess. I think Strava's app has this feature as well, not sure though. Not a deal-breaker, more of a would-be-nice-to-have.",Others
2850,WoD is fantastic. I especially like that it maps the run/walk/hike live (even in some cases where I didn't expect it to be able to download a map). Really helpful in unfamiliar areas.,Others
2851,"Also, I must admit that now that I \_do\_ have the Apple Watch, I do find myself tinkering with it way more than I thought I would. And with the whole pandemic thing going on and the upcoming option to unlock my phone with my Apple Watch instead of my stupid masked-up face, I think I will be wearing the watch for grocery runs and so on.",Others
2852,Apple was dodgier than usual about CPU performance throughout the conference. :/,Others
2853,So will the discounted S6 be a better deal than the S7?,Others
2854,Series 5 was also effectively Series 4 with a new (always-on) display and compass.,Others
2855,"In my opinion, this year’s event was very anticlimactic. Because of the pandemic, I think that innovation for this year was probably difficult to develop, and therefore this year’s new lineup is just tweaking the old one. Unless you’re really excited about the 120Hz refresh rate, I would say this is a great year to take a discount and go for the iPhone 12 and Apple Watch Series 6.",Others
2856,Waiting on deals for the S6. My 2yr old S5 is showing signs of wear and the battery life is down to 83%.,Others
2857,"The target market for Series 7 watches is not Series 6 owners.  A few people will upgrade early because they really want to have the bigger screen or fast charging, but new customers and upgrades from 3 and 4 will play a much bigger part.  I have a Series 4 and don't plan on upgrading until it wears out, but if it got broken or stolen, a Series 7 would feel like a very real improvement.",Others
2858,"Pretty minor upgrade but I did laugh when after all the rumors about a square edge they emphasized that it was now ""rounder"" than ever.",Others
2859,"Is this a big deal though? Is the performance of the S6 lacking? 

Or is it more a “future proofing” thing to increase CPU capacity? 

If the old chip still is plenty capable is there any point in spending money and effort on making it more powerful if it doesn’t make any real world difference to the consumer?",Others
2860,There's a reason why Apple didn't talk about CPU in A15 either. Instead they used word play to show it's 40% faster *than the competition*. Which means the competition performance has increased significantly while A15 isn't a big upgrade at all.,Others
2861,I really feel like Apple should have just skipped this release of Apple Watch and started the transition to a 2 year release cycle.,Others
2862,"Damn, Does that mean the series 7 has the s6 chip from the series 6?",Others
2863,Wasn’t the chip in the S6 essentially the same as the S5 too?,Others
2864,"Also, the watch is the odd one with the official comparison pages on the apple website, it doesn’t allow you to choose previous watches like the iPhone and iPads. I suspect people will find out that there is actually no ~~kuch~~ much difference between each successive serie.

Edit typooooo",Others
2865,So will series 6 owners get all series 7 features ?,Others
2866,"Wow...is this sub actually learning how to be fans of Apple while still criticizing  them now? 

""It's been 84 years...""",Others
2867,Using last year’s chip to power more screen pixels sounds a lot like the dreadful iPad 3.,Others
2868,They always mention the chip and how it is better thsn the predecessor.But this time they did not mention anything about the chip in the watch section.,Others
2869,"Yeah so AW8 = same screen as AW7, but new internals and perhaps additional sensors.",Others
2870,"I would have grabbed a S7 had it literally had been a S6 with better battery life. Since it’s the same battery life, I’ll take a discounted S6 instead.",Others
2871,I don’t see the issue with this. They’ve done this before. Most people won’t upgrade their watch year on year. I’ll be upgrading from the S5 so it’s enough of a jump for me with the addition of the features I didn’t get by buying the S6,Others
2872,"Don't need more performance in the watch, but a smaller chip with better power efficiency would be very welcome",Others
2873,"So they're going to phase out the series 6 as soon as possible, if they haven't already, so you can't find a better deal on an Apple watch.",Others
2874,"So other than a slightly bigger screen, there’s nothing new?",Others
2875,I was really hoping for a redesign this year. I will still be upgrading my series 1 though :/,Others
2876,This years apple event was pretty disappointing. More of the same ole and nothing ground breaking and interesting.,Others

2886,yeah. brand new s6 cpu...,Others

2891,This sucks I was so hyped to buy a new Apple Watch. I’ll probably just get the iPhone 13 Pro instead.,Others
2892,Everything apple releases is the same as the previous version. It's just the best thing they've ever made. That's the only difference 😂😂😂,Others
2893,I’m just salty there’s no black option for the aluminum watch. Genuinely shocked they just didn’t do it this year. My series 3 is on its deathbed but it looks like it’ll have to stick it out another year.,Others

2895,It’s the newest Apple of Apple that ever was Apple. So new,Others

2903,"It’s not the first time they have done this, but at the same time it’s not a bad thing.

ATP.fm did a great little bit about this exact subject, as Marco said on the watch, efficiency is better than performance, from a dev perspective, as at least for his app, S6 chip was fast enough.
Instead, he would prefer if they could have more CPU for longer, instead of the app being kicked out of memory if it exceeds the limit.",Others
2904,I’ll keep my series 5 and my 8+ please and thank you. Both are working very smoothly and suffering no problems at all.,Others
2905,The sad truth is the volume of the Apple Watch is not huge enough to justify the development and production line cost of a new SoC. I hope we can at least have a 5nm watch SoC next year for the sweet battery life bump.,Others

Their comparison pages doesn’t even allow you to select their old series to compare to the new one, only way is to get a page with each watch and a list of specs rather than comparison. I suspect they also found out that it will too easily reveal that there is no “significant” upgrades or difference between each serie. With a new series number they can keep the price on the same level. I think this is good for the used watch market, it does keep old series more valuable.",Others
2913,While true it’s likely the global chip shortage is the reason.  And they’re making lemonade out of lemons.  Using what they could get.,Others

2921,"I feel like Always On was a game changer, I can see not being of that opinion but that is what made me go from not caring about Apple Watch at all to wanting one. A watch that doesn't always display time is kind of silly to me, but I can see why it might not be to others.",Others
2922,basically we’ve only had one processor bump from S4 to s7 that happened from s5 to s6.,Others
2923,"Still using my Series 4, there hasn't been much reason to upgrade. I've had always on watches before and used to turn the feature off...

Hopefully Apple will eventually put in another sensor, upgrade the chipset, or something next year. Maybe this year was ""redesign"" (I know, not much of one) and next year we'll finally get a bigger upgrade.",Others
2924,Always on is one of the biggest features they’ve ever shipped,Others
2925,"…and S6 was essentially S4 with “always on” and an O2 sensor (I regret upgrading). Sounds like S7 is an S4 with a slightly bigger bezel and a couple pretty new watch faces, along with the minor tweaks of the S5 & S6. The bigger bezel of the S4 is the last big jump in real improvements I register. 

They might have got me with the blood sugar and/or blood pressure features, but considering the economy I’m happy not to be tempted to upgrade for at least another year.",Others

Wait until you see what the Series 7 looks like!""",Others

2939,"The new display actually looks quite a lot nicer to me. Smaller bezels, closer to edge-to-edge, more screen real estate (enabling double infograph complications). If you're coming from the S4 you also get Always-on screen, which IMO could be worth it on its own.",Others
2940,"I mean, technically a newer chip would increase efficiency for the same tasks and counter balance the slight more power used to light a bigger screen. Is all theory but you get what I mean since newer chip often means more architecture optimizations and less power consumption per cpu instruction.",Others

2942,Fuck the chip in the series 3 is still good enough for 95% of features,Others

2944,The whole event felt underwhelming. Good for the iPad Mini though.,Others
2945,"Unpopular opinion, but I think the S7 looks _waaay_ better than those flat-sides renders. They managed to give us the extra screen real estate and smaller bezels without needing to go for the sharp design. It feels slightly less ""new"" but IMO its a win-win.",Others
2946,"Wait, why? Does the current watch really suffer from any performance issues? Hell, I have a series 4, and have never had it feel slow or sluggish to me… 

For the series 7 they significantly expanded the usable screen area (and therefore readability) on the watch, and it charges faster. Those seem like two great upgrades. What were people expecting?",Others
2947,"It was a new chip, not a huge difference but was up to 20% faster",Others
2948,"No. It was the S5 chip that was similar to the S4. 

The S6 chip actually has 20% performance improvements as it’s based on the A13’s High Efficiency cores. The S5 and S4 were based on the A12.",Others

2989,"Well to be fair, Apple always went two or so versions on the same die size before shrinking it again. And there have historically been some SOC versions that weren’t a huge upgrade over the last. Apple is also supposedly not coming out with their M2 chips until next year, so maybe they’re pushing all their efforts in their silicon to next year’s chips while keeping this year a small upgrade.",Others
2990,"The only specific improvement they mentioned was larger cache, as far as I could tell. Judging from that, I'm gonna say the rest of the CPU is exactly the same.",Others
2991,"They upped the transistor count from 11.8 billion to 15 billion, so there might be some performance benefit there.",Others
2992,Like that's not really the same the battery is puny compare to the iphones makes sense it can fill up that much.,Battery
2993,"To be honest, with how bad the supply constraints are in the industry, I’m surprised it took this long for Apple to bump into them. But I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the real reason the silicon didn’t get much for an upgrade across the board. Especially on the watch. If they have supply constraints and use the same CPU for both series 6 and 7, they can allocate what they have to wherever the demand is instead of not being able to sell series 7 because they don’t have the new chip but meanwhile might have a lot of stock of the Series 6 chip or vice versa.",Others
2994,"I think they omitted this because of the presentation order. iPhones were presented after the iPad but at the same time they wanted to talk about A15 during the iPhone presentation.

So rather than saying „it has the brand new A15“ and not go into detail they did not mention it at all.",Others
2995,The s6 already has insane fast charging,Others

3001,That’s the only reason I finally bought an Apple Watch during the launch. I was waiting for AOD.,Others
3002,"That’s also the reason for me, I waited till the S6 till I was completely fine with the watch.  As an normal watch user an Apple Watch without always on display looked kinda dead to me. Also i didn’t like the Delay and raise my Handy anytime I want to read the time, just like on an normal watch.",Others

3005,S6 had a better chip and a screen twice as bright.,Others
3006,“New design” lol,Others
3007,The only incentive I can think of is not having to factory reset the device just to upgrade watchOS,Others
3008,"That is true, good point!",Others
3009,"Yeah for most of the stuff, but my S3 has started feeling quite sluggish, so an upgrade might be in its place soon!",Others
3010,"Because, and this might shock you, not everyone already has an S6?",Others
3011,Well even Apple doesnt expect you to buy a 7 if you have a 6. People should stop expecting changes YoY that justify that. Is just not sustainable,Others
3012,"Well yes and no since the design of this watch is different. But if that’s not a big improvement from your current watch then yes there’s no point in upgrading. 

Are people expecting such ground breaking improvement to each watch that they will feel the need to upgrade every single year? I think that might be a little too optimistic. But for someone with a S3 this watch looks like it could be a nice upgrade.",Others
3013,"Also bigger, brighter screen, new case. But yeah.",Others
3014,"I skipped watching it all together, feeling like I wouldn’t miss anything. Looks like I was right.",Others
3015,"It’s getting to the point where it feels like the equivalent of doing a presentation every time the MacBook gets a small spec bump. There’s a reason why they announce them though press releases.

3019,That comment makes me sad. It’s like your excluding him. I feel we should all be included when it come to products.,Others
3020,Does anyone really notice that on a watch though? I can't say my S3 needs to be quicker unless it's doing an update. I'll upgrade for the bigger screen and always on though.,Others

3027,"For a trillion dollar company doing last minute improvisation, it’s still unacceptable for such a lacklusting update.",Others
3028,"To be fair they probably meant last minute as last minute before needing to go into mass production, not last minute before the keynote.",Others
3029,They do prototype countless designs of future products in their labs. Not too far fetched to believe that this was a contingency design that had lying around based off the previous Apple Watch styling.,Others

3106,"All of Apple's SOCs are related. Regardless, if we're going to guess what the issue facing Apple here is and proclaim it, without evidence, as the ""truth"" then I think it's more likely a combination of the watch being plenty fast enough and the chip shortage.",Others
3107,"They did at the end. They avoided it during the actual iPad Mini announcement, because they were saving the A15 discussion for the iPhone 13 announcement. But when they concluded it and re-hashed everything, they said the Mini is running the A15",Others
3108,"At the point the mini was introduced, the A15 had yet to be mentioned. I think they wanted to wait until the iPhone 13 announcement to properly introduce the A15, so they just mentioned the performance gains for the mini. As soon as I saw them do that, I thought to myself that it must be the A15 for them to not name check it, but I had to check the tech specs on their website to confirm.",Others
3109,"Maybe we were all beaten to a pulp by Apple throwing out specs every 2 seconds for all of their hardware that had little context. It was flashy, though.",Others

3115,"The USB-C decision is at least a financial one, and not a capability issue. They receive massive royalties from companies making lightning cables/accessories due to patents. When/if they switch to USB-C in the iPhone, they will lose billions of dollars.",Others
3116," That’s not really accurate. Node improvements are *either* X% performance gain or efficiency gain. I believe the new 5nm TSMC process is 4% of either vs their old 5nm. 

What they did for this was uarch improvements and a bigger battery. It’s unclear yet if it’s more efficient, but it does certainly have a bit higher performance. It’s actually also possible that they are using the new 5nm, but that’s not totally confirmed one way or the other AFAIK 

And FWIW it’s probably a *bigger* CPU, hence the 4/5 core GPU split. They probably use that for binning to improve yield on a slightly larger SoC.",Others
3117,"If you improve performance and efficiency it means the same consumption as it has for years, same-ish battery life.

3120,"Wondering when you wake up and move about, the watch has captured your SPO2 data from last night? I ask because after waking up, I need to keep my fitbit sense on for 20-30 min before the SPO2 data shows up. But luckily it gives me between 3-4 days of charge so no need to charge everyday",Others

And that link says ""open box"" yet the previous link I was using was for a brand new item.

Also please bear in mind that your mileage may vary. The Best Buy rep who I chatted with yesterday said ""normally this isn't a competitor's website that we would honor for price matching but I can make an exception this time"".

3122,"As a series 4 owner, I never once had an issue with delays or it not turning on. If anything it turns itself more often than it should because it thinks I am raising to see the time. Also sit turns on by time you look at it. It’s not like it’s a slow feature. I don’t really understand this argument.",Others

Reusing existing materials is great; not needing to is even better.",Others
3134,"I'm in a similar spot with a Series 2, and personally the larger/edge-to-edge display alone is worth that move IMO. The processor improvement (~2.5x faster) is pretty significant too *if* you're using apps on the watch often. I don't, but I probably would if the processor wasn't so super slow.",Others
3135,iPhone upgrade program,Others
3136,Doesn’t mean we can’t criticize them for their poor upgrades.,Others
3137,"Certainly and trust me.. I'm not buying any of these products.

This comes off as corporate shilling to me. People can't say they don't like X, Y, or Z about a product and they'd really want OTHER features that aren't there? And without these features, they're not really interested in products?

That's crazy dude. Get over it. People get to voice their discontent and lack of interest in products. That's not entitlement. That's consumerism and capitalism. Apple's not entitled to people's money just because their name is Apple.

Remove the yearly upgrade program and how many people do you think would be buying these phones each year?",Others

3141,"I'm glad to hear it, I just have heard from lots of others that they are disappointed.",Others
3142,"I am thinking for myself. Sorry if it wasn’t clear, but I held up upgrading to the 6 for the same reasons and although I am tempted by the no bezel design of the 7, the fact that it is otherwise unchanged from the 6 holds me back from upgrading for the same reasons.",Others
3143,"It used to be for the non-cellular model, but watchOS 8 has rectified that.",Others
3144,Talking about style decisions on Apple Watch 3. It had that silly red dot on digital crown and side button was made nicer on 4. Screen did got bigger and also edge-to-edge.,Others
3145,Apple has been steadily getting worse at contextualizing specs in real world usage since Steve died. Change my mind.,Others
3146,"That’s not logic, while it might sound logical they are probably producing something for next year. Look at AMD.. they didn’t have shit for years and then Ryzen.

It could be good to take a year off and just focus on full on development and production of something bigger then a minor chip change.",Others
3147,I don’t think I have. It’s a general comment on the competition lagging behind.,Others
3148,"I reeeeeeeally am tempted by the new Fold 3. But, I'm very deeply hooked into the Apple/iOS ecosystem of services and hardware, as is my family and home. So it'd be a real PITA to switch. Especially for what amounts to an experiment. And you have to figure that Apple will have a foldable or rollable at some point.

Imagine an iPhone Pro Max that unrolled to like a 14"" 16:9 tablet. Yum.",Others
3149,"Bro the Z Fold is a game changer. Finally got to move away from the massive surfboard phones, and it has a ridiculously big display too. Really hard to even consider going back to a normal phone now after a couple weeks. I was waiting for the apple event to decide if I'll keep it and... I think I'm keeping it.",Others

A totally different concept of a watch but I'm finding that it has most of the features of the Apple Watch but also has many many features that the Apple Watch does not.  And with all the bells and whistles running I get 14 days of battery on a full charge.  I can turn some or all the features off and get something like 2 months.  It's crazy good and until Apple fixes the battery life, I'm not using their watch.  I can't believe they sell such a nice watch that has 1 day of use before needing a charge.  Completely ridiculous.",Others

3154,omg shut up already. get a nokia or something,Others
3155,"Yeah, they could have done that, but they didn’t. We have yet to see an Apple Watch that can achieve 24 hours or more in battery life. Instead, we’re told that 18 hours is “great” and that’s that. End of discussion.",Others
3156,"You’re forgetting race-to-sleep. If you have a fixed amount of work to do, getting it done faster and then sleeping the processor will save battery, even if the processor consumes a little more power/sec in doing the work. watchOS is designed to race to sleep very aggressively. (Probably too aggressively if you ask anyone who’s ever made a Watch app.)",Battery
3157,"Looked over the data, it goes on random intervals but it does capture and record overnight and on wake-up.",Others
3158,"That’s great that it works for you, but I’ve had my series 4 since launch day and I would say probably 30-40% of my wrist raises require a shake to get it to realize it’s being looked at. It’s not good for a quick glance if I have to be super deliberate about how I raise my arm.",Others
3159,"Yeah it sucked in 2015 when it came out, but Apple has nailed it by now. Works basically every single time.",Others
3160,"Most of the time I have had no issue, but with longer sleeves or working out I have. Nothing like being mid push-up, pull-up, crunches, or on a run and having to mess up your form and rhythm to get your arm just right for it to turn on rather than being able to glance at it with the display at any angle always showing the time",Others
3161,Wow that’s awesome and can’t believe I’ve had this watch for this long and didn’t know this lol. Thanks!,Others
3162,"Wow, that makes a big difference.  Do you wear it overnight?",Others
3163,It was a **plastic** clone of the 5. Hardly a new design.,Others
3164,That’s the most comparable. But also the C stood for Colour no?,Others
3165,Agreed. It’s terrible that they still sell a Watch that can’t be updated without wiping it.,Others
3166,"So glad the watch didn’t match those terrible leaks, which people pretended looked good because Apple. It would’ve sucked if I had to wait through several years of straight-edged sharp-angled design before I could upgrade again.",Others
3167,They really don’t need to release a new watch every year if they are not going to change anything.,Others
3168,Oh they’ll miss my 500$ mark my words!!,Others
3169,"I am going to get an SE which has that larger display mostly because my battery is really struggling these days. With AppleCare+ the S6 is $160 more than the SE and an always on display, O2 sensor, ECG sensor, and 20% faster chip just doesn’t feel worth that.",Others
3170,"A new design was introduced last year, why would they change it again? It’s an “s” release.",Others
3171,"> not meeting expectations

That's what I'm getting at. People have this weird belief that every year Apple must announce something as game-changing as the original iPhone, and if they don't, its ""the worst keynote ever"". I just don't understand why people get so worked up about their own misguided expectations.",Others
3172,You can create an automation in your Shortcuts app on your iPhone that turns AOD on/off based on various triggers (like time of day).,Others
3173,"I’ve heard that the AoD knocks a solid 10-15% off the battery at the end of the day. Seems like a worthwhile tradeoff to me, but you can always turn it off and regain that hit!",Battery
3174,Still your Apple Watch Series 3 has the biggest battery size if I am correct. Series 4 downgraded the battery significantly.,Battery
3175,"How’s the battery? Os update tend to have bugs that cause battery drain.

It’s nice for those who already have s3 but won’t recommend it for someone looking for a new one. SE is still a better choice, was hoping Apple phase out s3 already instead of milking it.",Battery

I would love USB-C on my iPhone, if for nothing else then simply just to cut down on the number of cords I have… but, viewing it from a business standpoint, I totally get it.",Others
3181,"You see, I'm in a different boat. We are very cross platform at home and at work / college, and having all Apple phones and tablets alongside Windows machines and some Linux laptops and some Chromebooks and Samsung TVs was a PITA enough to stop me from getting even deeper into the ecosystem. Apple really doesn't play well with others. So it's strictly about phones and watches for us (well Airpods too...)",Others

The only thing that Apple doesn't do is easy end-user repairs, but surely Apple just wants to make sure  repairs are done right, and if you have AppleCare+ they really are not that expensive or troublesome.

Consumers have every right to complain about the things they don't want, and then they have every right to never buy the product. I will complain about what I don't like about the direction of Apple and then I will go on to NOT upgrade my phone even though I'm a member of the upgrade program.

3446,Yes! That's all part of the challenge. It also gets harder and harder to feed it every day (the step counter increases). Keep your Nomi alive for as long as you can!,Others

3448,Similar minds!,Others

I appreciate that so much, thank you!",Others

3454,Thanks heaps for that! Please let us know what we can do to make this better for you,Others
3455,"Hmm — this is a common problem. this is a standalone Apple Watch App (quite a new thing), so it doesn't need companion Phone app to work and sometimes, your phone's default settings block apps from automatically transferring to your watch. It's a bit painful and I hope Apple fixes this.

1 Go to the App Store on your Apple Watch

We'll keep it in mind (I'm assuming it runs on Android?) but it sounds like it may be too heavy a task to tackle in the near future. 

Thanks again!",Others

So great that you picked up on the metaphor!",Others
3473,😆 so glad your Nomi has found a good home. Too much petting is a good problem for it to have. On another note we have picked up on the glitch and will make sure its fixed soon. Thanks for the support K,Others
3474,"That doesn't sound good. Could you try and reset your watch and see if that helps? (I know, I just asked you to 'turn it off and turn it on again 🤦🏻but hopefully it works)",Others

Thanks for the download, I'm keen to hear your thoughts!",Others
3479,YOU DID IT!! Keep going! There’s so much more to come!,Others
3480,That's great news! How long have you kept yours alive for so far?,Others
3481,"Brilliant tactic. I've added it to our feature list — we'll get to it as fast as we can!

Thank you so much for supporting us!",Others
3482,"Hey there! You don’t need to have the app open. Nomi works separately from the Activity app. Every step you take is still counted, but starts from zero every time you feed Nomi!",Others
3483,Great idea!! This is definitely something we'll do this next release. Might go down this thread asking people to rate it in the app store for now :) thanks for the suggestion.,Others
3484,This is great and thank you. That was a special moment for me too!,Others
3485,It looks like your Nomi was alive before the update so unfortunately you'll only be able to choose casual mode for your next Nomi 😢 (updates will work for any Nomis hatched after the update),Others
3486,Hi ninepennylane. We've got a few ideas on things that might help. Just have to work out the mechanics on how to build them  😅 thanks for the feedback though and 22 days is really great work! Congrats!,Others

3499,Thanks for hatching your Nomi! It only currently has a small circular widget for the 'Modular' watch face. We'll be adding more complications soon!,Others
3500,"Hi there! It doesn't. It tracks steps separately. Every step you take fills in the ring above your Nomi's head. When the ring is full, you can tap it to feed your Nomi a heart!",Others
3501,"Thanks so much for that feedback! Nomi is absolutely supposed to track the app when it's not open. When the ring is 'charged', do you tap it to feed your Nomi?

Nomi needs care to survive. Every step you take fills the ring above your Nomi's head. When the ring is full, tap it to feed your Nomi! This happens after 1500 steps (on the first day — it gets harder but it sounds like you're doing so much more than needed!) 

Please let me know how you go.",Others

3509,Would something like a calorie count be useful to you?,Others
3510,It doesn't at the moment but we are working to make it a bit easier in our next update which is coming very soon. We hear you!,Others

3515,"Really sorry to hear about that, we havent heard about the app restarting like that but we've recently fixed a bunch of bugs and have also lowered the step count. Please feel free to let me know if you're still getting any errors and we'll look into it. 10 days is a huge effort. 🙌🏾",Others

3518,Done!! Congrats your #16 on health & fitness.,Others
3519,"I'm so sorry. That sounds like a glitch! I'm not entirely sure why something like this would happen. My co-founder let me know that it could have been an iOS update issue. To quote:   
— ""There was also an OS update recently, it’s possible the file was encrypted and when the app went to read it it got the handle to the encrypted file (as she hadn’t put her passcode in yet after the software update). The app would then effectively treat it as new and then when she reset it found the old file (which had died).  


This is a complex and highly unlikely issue. Once again, I'm sorry this happened to your partner's Nomi after surviving for so long!. We'll try continue to try to solve this issue.",Others
3520,"Hi there! Whoah 43 days is an achievement!! Im very impressed! 

I’m sorry to hear that - just to clarify do you mean it’s been losing hearts overnight?",Others
3521,Hi Laletje! Thanks for letting us know! Could you please send us your watch series and size?,Others

3524,Hi there! I'm so sorry for the late response. Nomi lives for as long as you keep the streak up for! 66 days is a huge achievement — is Freddy still alive and well?!,Others

3526,Died reading this,Others
3527,"Hi there! This is my fault. I should make it more obvious, but when you press the ring with the heart in it, you can feed your Nomi! 

Here’s to hoping you give it another shot! Thanks for the super useful feedback.",Others
3528,"2 quid is too expensive, has a 1k phone and spends 400/500 on a watch but won’t pay 2 quid for app.",Others
3529,It’s the price of a coffee. Sometimes it’s fine to take a little leap of faith every now and then.,Others
3530,"Yeah, it's been hurting us. We hope Apple do something about this soon!",Others
3531,Thank you! It’s downloading as I type. Will it work when I’m using my stationary bike?,Others
3532,Any plans to add it as a corner complication with a “health” bar to know where the little dude is at on food?,Others
3533,I put it on the dock and when I go to open it it crashes,Others
3534,"When you feed the pet, does it start the step counter over from zero? Or does it carry over excess steps? Most of my walking is done in large bursts.",Others
3535,"Oh that was my mistake, I searched on the iphone’s watch section/got into the normal store I guess. Many thanks, found it on the watch.",Others
3536,"Ahh, I missed that! Okay. Got it. Poor guy's gonna die because I didn't tap him on time.",Others
3537,"That's spot on queerestqueen! You've absolutely nailed it. Sorry for the lag lend27!  


To add, you'll also note that the number of steps per heart goes up each day by 50, meaning it's harder to keep your Nomi alive every day!",Others
3538,Op add it in post ... it’s helpful,Others
3539,For some reason it says i’m not logged in on the watch app store app. Even though i’m logged in on every possible settings menu,Others
3540,Well I’m a mobile QA engineer and occasional iOS dev so will let you know if I come across any bugs. But congrats. 🥳,Others
3541,Also it said „get the Nomi Watch Face“ or something similar. How?,Watch Face
3542,"Is there any guidance on what needs to be done for it? How many steps? Is it automatically fed? I’ve walked about 2,500 steps since downloading and the top circle has filled but the bottom bar of hearts only has a partially full one. Maybe a little “how to play” on a left or right swipe screen?",Others
3543,"I’m excited, I also sent this to a few friends. I’m an engineer on a tugboat so work is too dangerous for my Apple Watch.",Others

3545,Already way ahead of you 💜,Others
3546,"I only noticed it during setup! So far, all other screens have been fine. But all the screens during the setup steps had it. I hope that helps enough!",Others
3547,TBH I uninstalled it because it was so buggy.,Others
3548,"I can definitely post up a review! I have a suggestion like maybe being able to put Nomi to sleep with a slower rate of heart depletion at night since he’s sleeping, or for not so active days. I’ve had 2 Nomis die overnight one was 7 days old the next was 14 days old almost to his 3rd evolution :’-(.....I’m on my 3rd Nomi his name is Clyde.",Others
3549,You got it! Keep it comin’ :),Others
3550,Three days - since downloading the app. Can’t wait for it to grow :),Others
3551,If i could go to work I wouldn’t have any problems to get the steps but right now at home it’s harder :),Others
3552,Not on full lockdown no. I'm in NYC. But I'm WFH so I'm not commuting (which is my big walk daily) and we are trying to limit our outside time.,Others
3553,"I’m constantly tempted to upgrade, but I currently literally only use it as a Watch. So it would be wasted on me...he says wanting to play with a Tamagotchi.",Others
3554,I found it now. Turns out out the voice commands for Apple watch in norwegian makes it a struggle to find.,Others
3555,I've kept Roger alive for FOUR days! I'm genuinely enjoying this app! He's very smily today as we went for a run and later we're going to walk the dog.,Others
3556,Thank you. I’ll try it out later,Others
3557,Hey! I would love to review - is it possible to do that through the iPhone or do I have to use the watch to do it?,Others
3558,"Thank you for the response! But I do not have the Apple store app on my watch :/ I’ve tried looking in my phone and watch settings to see if it was switched off or hidden but nothing :(( I really want to play soon but still running!!

Edit: I do hope Apple fixes this soon too :(",Others
3559,O I didn’t get it cause it costs money :/,Others
3560,Done :),Others
3561,Aaaaa haha ok. Another question though. How long does 1 heart keep my precious little blobby alive for?,Others
3562,"You see, I love little apps like this that encourage people to go walking to take care of somebody or something else. Before I got a smart watch, I was playing Pokémon Go, before the main series games went to shit. I was primarily playing so I could transfer all the Pokémon I catch irl to my console game but with Nintendo keeping over half the Pokémon in the Pokédex out of the main game, I quit cold turkey and got myself a smart watch. Anyways, outside the rant, I loved having a tamagotchi as a kid and it looks like you recreated quite the similar experience! I commend you for that and look forward to seeing you port it to the google wear store.",Others
3563,I downloaded it however the steps do not sync up properly with the health app,Others
3564,"🤷‍♂️ I’ll give it a shot. It’s hard to reproduce the crash, (I know that makes it harder to diagnose but it is what it is)  so I’ll report back after a bit to let you know if the crashes disappear. Since Series 2 is a bit older/weaker than the latest models, have you tested the app on a Series 2 device?",Others
3565,"Cool cool! Thanks! It’s really cute! Excited to see what the baby blob turns into. I’m also super jazzed that it’s low maintenance. Just steps. Though, it would be nice to be able to adjust the steps per heart. For myself, I’d love for it to be around 5k per heart. :) 

Thanks for making this! Hope it’s a success!",Others
3566,I’ve already finished a workout since downloading!! Congrats on the app release 👾👾👾,Others
3567,Is it the number of days I’ve kept it alive?,Others
3568,Another thought would be to have Nomi not go through food while the watch is off the wrist and charging. We’ve both had one die while it’s on the charger.,Others
3569,"I installed Nomi last night and went to sleep.  He starved to death.  Added a new one this morning, and he’s a happy chappie😀",Others
3570,Thanks! My Nomi is still alive on Day 5 and has morphed.,Others
3571,😇😇😇😇😇😇 Going to show my spouse this super cool app!!!,Others
3572,"Just evolved! And awesome, so appreciate your response. Can't wait to see what y'all have coming :)",Others
3573,Every time I tip on the Nomi it makes a chirping sound. And it makes also chirping sound when it shows an emote.,Others
3574,Oh! I misread. Silly mistake.,Others
3575,Thanks! I searched Nomi in the App Store but didn’t find it...what does the icon look like?,Others
3576,"Great, thanks!! I'll grab it as soon as I can. I may wait a bit long, as was reading the comments and seeing some of the people having issues are S4 / S4 LTE users and that's what I have. But may still purchase now, even if I wouldn't be able to use it yet lol",Others
3577,Thanks. Got it now,Others
3578,Yessss. I’m so excited for updates! Thank you for creating this!,Others
3579,I’m at day 8 and looking forward to the next milestone change!,Others
3580,"Hi mate, I already had a review on there but just updated it as I’m at day 25 now. Keep up the good work and let those updates flow!",Others
3581,Any chance to delay that until after the quarantine is lifted? I’m at 8 days.,Others
3582,That would be perfect!,Others
3583,Only thing I can’t find is a “tip” option. Id love to supper the development more. This app is honestly so awesome and the user interface is very clean and visually appealing. Good job!,Others
3584,"Ah didnt think about that. Much appreciated, keep up the good work, i really like the app.",Others
3585,"THANK YOU! What, really?! That's amazing!",Others
3586,"Series 3, 38 mm 😊",Others
3587,👏 looking forward to the update. Hoping the redesign will be intuitive and accessible similar to force touch!,Others
3588,They have my money and their response kept me from seeking attention in the Apple store. Your money isn’t needed.,Others
3589,"Also, this is the screenshot of the 2/5 review: https://ibb.co/6DvQJCv
You responded to it.",Others
3590,"Of course your development costs need to be paid for. But that's independent from letting people try your product for a few days before they switch to premium. I tried all the virtual pets on the app store and they are just not great. Right now, I can't buy an app based on two screenshots and one 2/5 review, so I'll wait for other people to post reviews first. Good luck on your app, the screenshots look great!",Others
3591,I've taken my fair share of risks on apps that were buggy and unusable. To each their own.,Others
3592,"Hey bud, I was making a friendly joke. I completely understand that people are going through a quarantine period at the moment (as am I!). Hope you're keeping safe!",Others
3593,"What is this? A human response? Apologies from an internet stranger? 2020 just keeps on surprising. 

I didn’t see your initial reply, but I hope your mood is better! ☕️",Others
3594,"For the time being, it only works with your steps, meaning your arms must be moving. It sounds like it might be useful to enable workouts so it counts the time you spend on your stationary bike!

3596,Hi there all the crashes should be fixed now plus a few other changes. hope you're now enjoying the Nomi app. We're working away to add more feature but in the meantime we'd really appreciate a positive review in the app store if you had some time to spare 😊 thanks again for your support.,Others

3602,Thanks for grabbing it! The 'Modular' face should allow you to add it as one of the small circular complications — you'll see its face and how it feels right on the complication!,Others
3603,Brilliant! Please do let us know what you find!,Others
3604,"Hey, thanks! Super useful! Which Apple Watch do you have?",Others
3605,Hi grae_me we thick we've now fixed all the crashes! hope you're enjoying the Nomi app. We're working away to add more feature but in the meantime we'd really appreciate a positive review in the app store if you had some time to spare 😊 thanks again for your support.,Others
3606,Hangry Nomi does get pretty sassy!,Others
3607,"Oh! On the 'Modular' watch face, you're able to choose a small circular widget that shows your Nomi's face. It even switches faces to show you it's mood!",Watch Face
3608,"Not yet, there's only one for the Modular face for the time being. We'll make a note to add it in the near future for you!",Others
3609,I'm so sorry to hear that! We have been working super hard to squash those bugs in the last few weeks. I hope you could give it Nomi one more chance!,Others
3610,Brilliant suggestion. We'll be figuring out the best way to do this in the coming weeks! Thank you so very much and best of luck with Clyde!!,Others
3611,not sure the middle finger she gets periodically is helping... <-- Lol! It's just a little hangry. Thanks again.,Others
3612,"Oh yeah, I would be too were I in NYC. I’m lucky to be in MN and a second-tier suburb that borders rural areas. Plenty of space from people outside. Good luck, friend.",Others
3613,Oh thank you! A review on the iPhone will work! Thanks again!!,Others
3614,Have you updated your watch to the latest WatchOS? That could be it!,Others
3615,"Thanks for the support designmoreweb! What do you mean by 'not sync up'?

Is it not counting steps?",Others
3616,We haven't tested on a Series 2 devices so your feedback is so key! We're planning on saving enough cash money to buy older models to QA on. Thanks for keeping an eye out!,Others
3617,Ace! I hope you find joy in feeding your Nomi and keeping it happy! Thanks again!,Others
3618,Hi there! Hope your nomi is still alive and kicking! If you're loving the app we'd really appreciate a positive review in the app store if you have some time 😊 thanks again for your support.,Others
3619,"Sorry, I breezed right over your question! Yes it is!",Others
3620,We’ll be pushing an update in the next week that hopefully solves these problems for you! Thanks once again for the great suggestions!,Others
3621,"Oh my goodness. That's adorable. Thank you, there's more to come very soon (and hopefully forever!)",Others
3622,"Thanks for this, we'll take a closer look into this right away. We hope to solve this with our next update!",Others
3623,"Ahh yes, I think they're there by default, we'll add it to our backlog. A work-around for the moment would be to put your watch on mute. Hope that helps! Thanks for the feedback.",Others
3624,It's a smiley face on a white background! Can you try to search from your watch's App Store? Try searching 'nomi' or 'watch pet' and that should return the right result! Many thanks for your support!,Others
3625,Thank you! Any support would be greatly appreciated. We're going to make this the best watch companion possible! Please reach out if you have any questions — I'd be happy to answer them,Others
3626,Thanks a million! We're always keen to hear thoughts and ideas. Thanks for supporting us,Others
3627,We’ll be adding some really useful things in the next week that hopefully solves these problems for you! Thank you so much for your efforts!,Others
3628,Oh my! Congratulations! You should be evolving quite soon then! Thank you very much for your ongoing support!,Others
3629,"Hope you're spending some time with it at this age, they grow up so fast! 😄",Others

3631,"Hi sd408 we've now lowered the stepcount to adjust for the quarantine issue, hope you've now got it with your new update. If possible we'd really appreciate a positive review in the App Store. Thanks again for your support",Others

3637,You're right! My co-founder must have responded to that one. It seems like a bug that was ironed out!,Others

3639,Fair enough. Then just wait instead of asking for something for free. Easy as that.,Others
3640,2nd Edit: alright guys I get it. I’m cranky and it was a joke. Sorryyyy. I shall get over meself.,Others
3641,That is a BRILLIANT idea. Thank you!,Others
3642,"Looks really interesting! Is there a reason for using steps instead of calories, though?",Others
3643,Thank you. I think these sort of features would definitely be a huge drawcard for those in quarantine and wanting to keep fit.,Others
3644,"Yes, but i meant as not a circular complication; i tried putting Nomi as a corner complication but the little dude isnt an option for it. I was hinting at a possibility of a corner complication with a sliding bar showing if Nomi is on the lower/mid/high end of “food” at the current time, if that makes sense? Much like the Cardiogram app corner complication, or Pillow, Sleep++, Timer, etc.",Others
3645,"You can't sadly. Reddit doesn't allow that.

Try replying to your own post and then ask any of the mods if they can pin the comment to the top.",Others

3649,Yea it came with yesterday’s update.,Others

3653,It shows different steps on the watch and different in the health app before I downloaded I had 1500 steps on the health app after I downloaded I went for a walk on the health app it showed 2000 more steps so total 3500 however on the app it only showed 73,Others
3654,"So far I haven’t opened the app that much to be honest, between self-quarantine and working from home. The feeding animation seemed a little laggy but otherwise so far so good. I’ll post back with some long-term results in a couple days, hopefully with good results haha.",Others
3655,Oh good!  I thought I already killed 3 and couldn’t figure out why because mine is always happy.  I work in a hospital and walking around plenty.,Others
3656,"Yes, day 14!! Looks like some scaling issue. In the infograph watch face part of nomi’s face is cut out (tear drop missing). Looks like X-large face has no errors.

3662,"Yes, it did! Thanks so much 😊",Others
3663,Nice 🥳 I’m unfortunately back at 18 days because my Nomi died around 70-80 or so.,Others
3664,"What are you talking about, dude? I am asking for a free trial. Most apps work that way. Just read the comment and stop white-knighting around.",Others
3665,No worries! Thanks for the kind words :),Others
3666,"dude chill, twas a joke",Others
3667,"Ah, I must have misread! That's a brilliant idea. We'll drop it an upcoming release! Thanks sd408!",Others
3668,Hi Johhu we'd really appreciate a positive review in the app store if you have time and are still enjoying the nomi. Lots more features to come 😊,Others
3669,Go you! Well done for evolving Patrick! Thanks a million :D,Others
3670,"That's very bizarre. It uses Healthkit to track your steps so every step your watch tracks should be counted!

Is the problem still persisting?",Others
3671,"When the ring above your Nomi becomes full, do you tap it to feed your Nomi?",Others
3672,Ha! Yeah it gets a bit hangry sometimes. It's lucky you didn't choose to hit that snooze button.,Others
3673,"Oh, thanks a milli for this! We're on it ⚡️  


Can I ask which Apple Watch size you're using?",Others
3674,"Thanks for the great detective work on how to solve this, we're still trying to replicate this and will try and work it out 🤔 hope you and your Nomi are doing good 😊",Others
3675,Oh wow! Congratulations on keeping your Nomi alive for that long! We’re actually going to push an update to accommodate for those in quarantine in the coming days. Thanks again!,Others
3676,Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. That must've been frustrating. By 'reset your Nomi do you mean your Nomi died,Others
3677,I completely understand! We did lower the number of steps quite drastically to accommodate for the lockdown. Please do let us know when you start using it again :) Thank you for your support!,Others
3678,So happy to hear you've been more active! Day 8 is tremendous! Do you mean 1500 steps per day? I'm wondering if you received Nomi's last update,Others
3679,Oh no!! It’s getting tougher aiming to get to 60!!,Others
3680,"No worries, I personally just have a preference for those types of complications over circle complications for some reason. More “pleasing” to my eyes. Lol thanks for making the app!",Others
3681,Thank you! Same to you! I’m plenty busy finishing up my degree!,Others
3682,"Yeah it’s now part of Firebase (used to be part of a tool called Fabric), never used it on a watch app so you would have to look at that but yeah there might be a solution. The crash I have steps to reproduce to DM me and I’ll explain it for ya.",Others
3683,"I wanted to let you know that I reinstalled Nomi and I've been super happy with it! I didn't realize Nomi would evolve into all these cute forms! Super fun. The bugs are gone and it seems like you fixed the error where it didn't show the number of days I'd kept Nomi alive (looked like a formatting error, it just showed ... instead). Great app, glad I paid for it!",Others
3684,"Yes, i can do that :), oh and i don’t if it’s a bug but my nomi hasn’t grown since the update, I wonder why :)",Others
3685,Haha yeah awesome. Shame blobby died on the first few days of quarantine. Hit harder than I thought tbh. Not starting another life until I can leave again or I will be going through them so fast. He got a good 9 days though,Others
3686,"Yes, I thought the numbers were how many nomis that died, but now I know it's how many days it's been alive!  Now mine is on day 8 (almost 9), and I love it!  

I know some people have requested to change steps to calories, but I really prefer steps! Will you please keep steps as an option, too?  I walk and can keep with with increasing steps, but calories maybe much harder as I'm not a very big person - even I walk a lot, my calorie consumption may not be nearly as much as larger people.",Battery
3687,"Series 5, 44mm case",Others
3688,My boi just turned 21 but hasn’t evolved for what seems like ages. Has he reached an evolutionary cul de sac? He aught to be able to drink and gamble today.,Others
3689,Thank YOU for helping us out. Good luck with keeping your Nomi alive — keep it alive for long enough and there'll be surprises!,Others
3690,Agreed. Would love to see this.,Others
3691,Thankss for the update! We'll look into this one.,Others
3692,Your Nomi will be evolving very soon (and will continue to evolve in future)! Best of luck!,Others
3693,"Poor blobby! We recently pushed an updated that greatly decreased the number of steps to help people in lockdown keep active within their homes!

I hope this helps in some way :)",Others
3694,Thanks for the feedback ftgander - It is helpful! We're working to make it easier to keep alive in these tough times and the next release is just around the corner.,Others
3695,Absolutely! If anything we will have both as options. Congratulations on keeping your Nomi alive for that long!,Others
3696,Happy to hear that :) 20 days?! You're up there with the best! New evolution will be coming soon! Keep it up!,Others
3697,"Oh wow. Okay, this is bizarre. We'll have a look into this and get back to you! I hope this doesn't happen again with your newest updates!",Others
3698,Haha! Congratulations on 21 days! Brilliant effort — your Nomi's next evolution will be happening very soon!,Others
3699,This is all so wholesome! What a community!,Others
3700,"Thanks for another update, my Nomi is now 29 days old and finally grew again!  I especially like that the app displays my Nomi’s name on the all screen!  Will leave a review😃",Others
3701,The new update (Version 1.8) still has the issue,Others
3702,People rock! You all rock! 🎸 😄,Others
3703,"You are brilliant. Thank you for the time you put into writing this. The original intent was to feed nomi with your heartbeats using a similar formula, but decided against it for now to prove the concept without over-investing in the formula. And it looks like people like the concept! It

I’m so glad you brought this up, Id love to continue this conversation via DM",Others

3706,"Ah yes, I understand! That's a pretty good idea! You're not up to the final evolution yet (far from it!). There's been a delay with the update, but there are many more to come!",Others
3707,"I had this issue when I got a new iPhone and had to pair my Apple Watch again, the permissions were not there in the menu. Uninstalling the Pokemon go app and reinstalling it made the options appear again for me. Give it a try and hopefully it sorts it out for you.",Others
3708,"The player data from my phone syncs for me, but every single time I hit the START button on the watch, the “Open Pokemon Go on your IPhone to review HealthKit permissions” message pops up, and doesn’t let me track distance. How do I solve this issue?",Others
3709,What the hell last update killed my Apple Watch it won’t sync with pogo anymore. I liked using it to speed up my egg hatches. I’ve done everything including reinstalling app on phone and watch still no sync. Any help would be appreciated ,Others
3710,Same issue here. I try to hit cancel but when I push start on the watch it goes back to same message. Never starts. ,Others
3711,Go to your settings in Pokemon GO and turn off adventure sync and then back on. it should ask if you want to turn on a setting. fixed mine.,Others
3712,So the Pogo app isn't showing there. I thought I had done it right but obviously not? Any idea how to get it setup to show here? It does show up in Health ,Others
3713,Thanks. I will give it a shot,Others
3714,I have had the watch since this post and still haven't solved it. Just nother stupid thing from Niantic,Others
3715,I was hoping there was a way to make it go away. It does that EVERY time I use the app? Sounds like Niantic,Others
3716,I’m having the same issue myself. I can’t figure it out. :/,Others
3717,I have figured it out. This mystery. I opened the health app. The white square with red heart at top corner.  Make sure your watch is listed in there AND Pokémon go is listed under app section. If you want screen shot just email me at allgottago@mac.com and I’ll send them. I hope this helps at least one person! ,Others
3718,Try toggling the motion and Fitness off in the settings first.  Then toggle the adventure sync off and on in the pogo app.  Then  check the sources in the health app.  It should trigger pogo to appear there. ,Others
3719,Go to the apple health app and switch all on under resources. It worked immediate for me,Others
3720,Just wear it. It’ll count your steps a touch more accurately and report them through adventure sync. I haven’t used the Watch app since adventure sync went live,Others
3721,"You are correct. This worked for me when I went into health app, went to sources at bottom, clicked on Pokémon go, turned off all categories, then turned on all categories. I went back to check the watch and boom now it works again. I have found that while app is active in the watch you can spin stops while moving faster then normal. Although I should never condone driving and playing (some of us do it) it helps with spinning stops at 25 to 30 mph.. sometimes more.",Others
3722,I just mean overall. Pogo seems like a shitshow (should have known) so what other apps are sweet on it?,Others
3723,"Oh wow. Thank you, that worked!!",Others
3724,What finish do you have on the watch aluminum ss or titanium?,Others
3725,The original is a hair trapper too. Only really when I put it on though.,Others
3726,Good to know. Thanks!,Others
3727,I really enjoyed the Tom's Guide review. They do a great job of not being fan boys and using numbers to support their claims. ,Others
3728,Do the watch reviews normally go up around the same time? I’m guessing there are less people that review them compared to the phones ,Others
3729,"[Just watched this Chinese review on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/kqz67DkJfvE?t=8m2s) You don't have to understand the words, but starting from the timestamp I link, there are quite a few samples that demonstrate that XS is a huge step forward in terms of camera performance compared to X. To sum up:

* Pixel size grew from 1.22μm to 1.4μm and gets deeper, all in all allowing 50% more light in (this part is from another review I watched)
* Number of Focus Pixels have doubled
* Significantly improved low-light performance
* Significantly improved HDR performance (especially at night with harsh light sources)
* Live HDR preview in the viewfinder
* Main camera's focal length gets a bit wider from 28mm to 26mm
* Stablized front camera video recording
* Stereo sound recording in videos",Others

I’ve upgraded annually via carrier financing since 2010 but the XS Max seems to finally be the perfect phone for what I wanted. Can’t wait. ",Others
3734,My biggest takeaway from all these is that Google is doing something right with their cameras on the software end. The Pixel's camera has gone unbeaten for some time now. ,Others
3735,"Why does everyone seem to think a phone needs to be “radically redesigned” every year? That always seems to be the biggest criticism leveled at the iPhone - “it looks the same as last years model!” Seriously, how many variations are there on a 6 inch piece of metal and glass?

3740,"I’m thinking about upgrading from a 6 to possibly the Xs but likely the X (though it’s no longer for sale though Apple...). I’m not a fan of losing the headphone jack, so once I do this I’m mostly forced to go Bluetooth because I often have to charge and take calls at the same time.

I’m still gonna wait for iPhone Xr reviews though.",Others
3760,"OK, I haven't been able to find an answer to my question anywhere...

&#x200B;

Can the iPhone Xs or Xs Max shoot portrait mode with the adjustable bokeh using the wide angle lens or is it still just the telephoto?  I have the 8 Plus and only being able to use the telephoto for portrait annoys the hell out of me.  I had the Pixel 2 XL and it used software (like the Xr) to implement portrait mode using the wide angle lens.  That's all I want and would upgrade for this feature alone. ",Others
3761,How do you make tables in reddit,Others
3762,"Wow, it's crazy how much better the XS camera and A12 is than last year.

I swear Apple silicone cases last exactly one year as mine is starting to fall apart just like it did after a year on my 7+. ,Others

Almost looks like the technique used by the micro 4/3 cameras to get a 40mp shot by doing pixel shift stitching (which would improve details in shots). My take away is that phone cameras are all just using a lot of software tricks now to get passable shots.,Others
3783,Is that really surprising? Apples cameras have been middle-of-the-pack for a few generations now and they didn't make any big steps forward this year to correct that.,Others
3784,"I've heard alot say the pixel 2 still has the best overall camera for stills, assuming you don't use zoom.",Others
3785,They usually offset the iPhone and watch review embargo by a day,Others
3786,"Pretty happy to hear this stuff coming from a 6 to the XS w/ primary reasons being speed increase, display quality and camera quality.  XS got all 3 on lock down!",Others
3787,"This is the info I was looking for, thanks",Others
3788,Pretty sure the low-light/HDR improvements are from the software updates they mentioned and should be included in iOS 12 for the iPhone X. Unless they made them exclusive to the XS for some reason...,Others
3789,They've officially priced me out! I'll be holding onto my 7 for a long time from the looks of it.,Others
3790,I can't even bring myself to get a regular X. I think I'm gonna upgrade to an 8 this winter. I love my 6S but tbh I just want a camera upgrade,Others
3791,"> I still find my 8 Plus' screen superior though.

In what way?",Others
3792,I’m actually thinking of “downgrading” from my X to a Xr. Get a better phone and pay $10 less per month,Others
3793,"Surprisingly enough, the Verge's review (in my opinion) was pretty good. The quality of their videos varies wildly between their journalists though, so it's not too surprising.",Others
3794,"Interesting, I’m not familiar with this. Do you have a link to a mirror or summary?",Others
3795,"Why? 
They were never pc enthusiastic channel.

They were always about mobiles and general consumer devices. Their garbage skills in PC building shouldn’t change that.",Others
3796,The Verge is a joke.,Others
3797,I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks The Verge is a low quality website. I go out of my way avoiding it as well as Forbes and Fox News. ,Others
3798,To be fair... they may be all about electronics but they don't build computers.  Sponsoring them to build one was a terrible idea and it showed.,Others
3799,"Has anyone that's used the camera understand why they call it out as ""good not great?"" Is it a step down from the iPhone 8/X? Seems like it should be better, or is it just a relative comparison and there are actually cameras that blow it out of the water?",Others
3800,I’ve never cringed so hard on a tech video before this one.,Others
3801,"So I think one of two things happened:

1: it was all a PR stunt. It definitely got people talking about the verge, and although they got disliked into oblivion, people were making reaction & mock videos, getting people to talk about them even more, etc. great for clicks = ad revenue

2: it was the kids first or second time building a PC with little help. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him before, maybe it was one of his first jobs on camera and he built his own PC, so he volunteered and the boss gave him the green light. I don’t even really blame him because he was so young and unknowledgeable, producers should have spotted some of the problems",Others
3802,Who was the writer of that?,Others
3803,The guy who did the XS review for the Verge needs to never do a review again. ,Others
3804,I just watched that video and am not seeing anything glaringly wrong  beyond not starting with the CPU. His warnings and descriptions are accurate enough for enthusiasts or prosumers.,Others
3805,Really like this review actually. He did a pretty solid job much better than The Verge review I watched,Others
3806,Same man. Saw MKBHD was wearing one in his iPhone video,Others
3807,"A-freakingMen this is the first one I haven't carrier financed and bought straight out. I intend to use it beyond a year, I can't imagine the next iPhone beating it by much. ",Others
3808,I hope you’re right on the battery. My X gets pathetic battery life. ,Battery
3809,I pre-ordered the XS but debating to return it for the Xs Max due to battery life. I just hate large phones because I love keeping it in my pocket and prefer the smaller size. Is the size really that big of a difference? ,Others
3810,"Hey so this is the first time I've really ever looked into an upgrade, is there a difference between using a carrier contract and getting it straight from Apple?",Others
3811,"The XR was almost the perfect phone for me because it literally had everything and no extra bells and whistles that I don’t use like 3D Touch. I just couldn’t get over the lack of a 1080p screen. I get that maybe it’s not so bad, but for 2018 it’s sort of the principle of the matter. You should have at the very least a 1080p lcd screen. ",Others
3812,"The only negative about the max besides the price and the pathetic 64gig option is, it's just a bigger iPhone but isn't modified in any way in the software to take advantage of the bigger screen like the note 9. Regardless, enjoy it! ",Others
3813,I personally want a smaller display. If they had half the bells and whistles in an SE footprint then I’d pay top price to get it. ,Others
3814,just hit me that the XS Max is the iPhone I really wanted *last year*.,Others
3815,"A while back MKBHD did a blind comparison with iPhone X, Pixel 2, and 2 more I can’t remember. I pretty consistently picked the Pixel 2 pics (iPhone X second). It really is a great camera, especially at looking “natural”. If I switched to Android I’d go Pixel I think. ",Others
3816,It’s not surprising given the reputation of Google in the software engineering field. ,Others
3817,Really excited to see what the do with the Pixel 3,Others
3818,Agreed. Even last year going from my 6 to an X was incredible. I can't imagine going from a 6S or a 7 to the XS. Probably just that much better. I wanted to upgrade this year but this phone still feels as good as day one.,Others
3819,"Exactly! As a current 6 owner eagerly awaiting my XS, I am hoping the camera jump will be ridiculous.",Others
3820,"That's how tech reviews work. Tech reviews always compare the last version to the newest. Most tech reviews won't compare it to 6, 7, 7s, 8, 8+, X. There are just too many versions to compare. People want to read what new features were introduced. Not a recap of the last 3 years. ",Others
3821,You're right. I noticed that too.,Others
3822,"I actually prefer for phones to look the same for 2-3 years while being refined, similar to cars. Gotta give the design time to mature and iron out problems. ",Others
3823,"Yeh I was thinking the same reading some of these.  Like ffs it's a S model, the entire point is to not be a radical new design/product why the fuck are you so called professional reviewers not able to grasp this...",Others
3824,"&#x200B;

probably tomorrow or Thursday.

&#x200B;

reviews for both products haven't dropped on the same day before",Others
3825,"You can see that the iPhone utilizes a bit of blur and smoothing around the facial features which leads to small details getting washed out or missing completely.
In all fairness, for many people this is a desirable effect in photography. 

For those who like photos which are as close to reality as possible or want to do post-processing it often sucks.",Others
3826,I can’t speak for the new ones but I came from a pixel 2XL to an iPhone X and the camera is noticeably worse in average to low-light situations. Much more grainy. ,Others
3827,"I agree their photos were hit and miss - but I really noticed it on the portrait of the woman with the brick wall in the background.  I'm not sure if they used portrait mode for that shot, but everything in the background was blurry and lacking detail relative to the Pixel 2 version.  Although it seemed less significant on the face.  ",Others
3828,Included it. Thanks,Others
3829,"I have the Beats X as well. Comparable to the AirPods sound quality wise maybe better if you get a good fit (in-ears). 
However despite having the special Bluetooth chip, pairing is a little annoying. No magic like AirPods, old school long pressing the on button and waiting a few seconds. ",Others
3830,AirPods will blow you away and I see them on sale quite often now.,Others
3831,"There isn't much to be tested, everything can be tested within a day, except battery, which can be tested within two days at best... It's almost the same phone as X.",Battery
3832,Some people in the watch sub were saying the walkie talkie was pretty poor audio quality but I’d be interested to see a wider review pool!,Others
3833,"I think a lot of people downplay the tech that is jammed into this phone. Too many people get hung up, still, on the fact that there is no headphone jack. It definitely has downsides. But man does is it have some awesome tech. ",Others
3834,"Definitely, it's a huge upgrade from iOS11. My 6 feels so much better and faster now that I'm happy keeping it for another year.",Others
3835,"Yeah I felt the same, especially when I saw the picture you reference. ",Others
3836,"yea, if I was to get an android phone. It would be the Pixel. ",Others
3837,"I had a Pixel 2 and sold it. A lot of the photos were too dark. A beautiful summer landscape rendered dark and gloomy. A family BBQ dark and foreboding. Yes, the Pixel 2 camera is technically competent but it tries too hard to keep the detail in the highlights, often making the rest of the scene too dark. That's why I sold it. It wasn't faulty or anything - others have reported the same.",Others
3838,[MKBHD's review here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAF9BWpzwvI) Really liked this review. He did a solid job,Others
3839,"Yes. Your phone will still get updates for years to come and is still very snappy, especially with iOS12. Get a nice vacation or treat your relatives with a nice meal instead.",Others
3840,If you're fine with that size of phone the XS Max would be pretty cool. Aside that if you got the money why not?,Others
3841,"All of these reviews were made in a few days. The ""big"" reviews by sources like AnandTech and GSMArena are yet to be released. But it might take them a few more days/weeks. 
Tom's Guide did a good job imo, but others too.",Others
3842,"Doesn't think new iPhones are the best thing ever = bad reviewer. Funny how this works. He does this review stuff for about 10 years now, he knows his shit. He has given good and bad notes to all kind of phones and was generally pretty spot on. If Josh still was with the Verge he'd probably been a lot harsher on this batch of phones.",Others
3843,"John Gruber uploaded some on DaringFireball. Also one of the reviews contained links to Flickr, but not sure which one.",Others
3844,I liked Mashable’s review the best. But none of the reviews will be biased towards a Xs or Xs Max. That’s simply preference if you like a bigger screen or not. Personally the smaller size is my perfect fit. ,Others
3845,It isn't out until next month. ,Others
3846,That’s just one point of view. Another might be that most users charge overnight and don’t need to be encouraged to use a fast charger which will cut the lifespan of their new phone when they don’t need one. Another might be that must users don’t touch the adapter and it’s both a costly inclusion for Apple and the environment. ,Others
3847,Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/wiki/table-format?st=JM86GYE8&sh=3a4e02e7,Others
3848,Sure you did,Others
3849,"I've checked EVERY review listed in the table for Face ID thoughts. The best comparison is in [CNET's video](https://youtu.be/cAcBFBPwmrQ?t=222) at 3:43 - 3:52. I can consistently replicate the iPhone X result. If the X🅂 only gets that much faster at unlocking, my wallet feels totally safe. I can't find a comparison with locked notifications, though.",Others
3850,"My sister is still using my old brown iPhone 6 leather case which I bought on day 1. Granted you can see it’s age, but apart from that it still looks pretty decent. Like an old wallet. ",Others
3851,"Interesting, it doesn't ask me (Adblocker disabled). A paywalled article would be completely inaccessible except if you are willing to pay to read it.

3852,Try opening it in a private browser. Does that allow you to view it? ,Others
3853,I wouldn’t say it’s crap but I wouldn’t say it’s worth the upgrade from the X. The biggest difference I see between the X and Xs is in the TechCrunch review. They have 2 smart HDR photos and while the X photo isn’t bad I see a noticeable improvement with the Xs,Others
3854,Even with a better camera it’s hardly worth an upgrade ,Others
3855,"The camera is extremely not crap. By any standard, it’s an excellent camera, if not one of the best available. Whether it’s the very best remains to be seen. ",Others
3856,"Unless you take a million photos or game a lot, you probably won’t need a new one for 3-4 years.",Others
3857,Is this seriously an issue? Never used a gimbal before so I have no experience with it. ,Others
3858,The camera is honestly the main upgrade for the phone...,Others
3859,It isn't out yet. ,Others
3860,well it looks like you won’t be upgrading lol touch id is probably never coming back ,Others
3861,"""this"" what?",Others
3862,"Cool, thanks for the context and the hard work put on the reviews.",Others
3863,"Kudos to AT team. Your reviews are TechPorn. I could read your novella-ish comprehensive reviews on and on. 

A small request, if you could spare some time, kindly do review Poco F1 too. I'd love your take on this very capable budget phone and insights into its liquid cooling tech as well. ",Others
3864,"You guys do an awesome job in your reviews , always look forward to it.  ",Others
3865,Nice! Thanks! Been missing your Apple kit reviews. It all kinda disappeared after Anand left.,Others
3866,This is fantastic news! I hope you guys recap the SoC updates made by the A10 and A11. I know that's a BIG ask but any info you guys can provide so we know how we got to something as insane as the A12 is a huge information win!,Others
3867,This warms my heart. Thanks for reviewing the Xs lines; I can’t wait :),Others
3868,Thanks for the update.   I have been reading AnandTech for a long time (I do miss Anand's excellent reviews) and hands down this is the best tech review site on the internet.  I look forward to AT review of the new iPhones.  Thanks for all the excellent work you all do.,Others
3869,"I've always found it odd that there hasn't been a Macbook or iMac review since 2015. Anand's coverage of Apple's hardware boosted the site's reach far beyond what regular hardware did back then, and once he left any hardware reviews coverage for Apple's notebooks dropped off rapidly. ",Others
3870,"Sounds good, thanks. Do you have any info to share regarding the embargo lift for the Apple Watch S4? Its clear now that it's different from the one for the new iPhones and I really didn't expect that.",Others
3871,"Any right ETA you're willing to guess at? Are we talking weeks or a couple of months, at a guess?",Others
3872,"Could you tell me why relatively speaking AT has published so much Huawei/Honor reviews, hands ons and liveblogs? I mean, I am European so Huawei phones are for sale in every store, but you're American and Huawei is as good as absent from the US market. That would make the reviews irrelevant to a lot of readers, right?",Others
3873,"So I understand if you can't comment on this since it might be private, but do both Anand and Brian still work at Apple? Do you guys know in which area of expertise?",Others
3874,"""Tom's Guide"" second link might be interesting to you. They have some real life benchmarks which are pretty impressive. ",Others
3875,Me too! I’ve been following them a long time; their reviews were always so good that it was just good reading even if wasn’t on a quest to get a new phone,Others
3876,"I must admit: I personally stopped visiting Anandtech not that long after Anandtech himself left - the reviews during his tenure were amazing and afterwards it became a little too Tom’s Hardware-y. 

But GSMARENA is still good ",Others
3877,"You’re right, they never did a 2017-iphones review... Weird. Usually their reviews are the absolute best (camera prowess/review aside).m",Others
3878,"That's just a spec page, isn't it?",Others
3879,damn the pictures do look worse. Too smoothed and saturated at some points,Others
3880,Seriously? The 5D Mk4 will obviously blow away any tiny sensor camera. It's a full frame DSLR..,Others
3881,Lol its a $2500 dslr of course it would,Others
3882,"Obviously a Canon 5D is going to come away the clear winner, but that comparison in particular was really fuckin stupid. Why even bother if they’re just gonna use an out of focus shot anyway? ",Others
3883,"I was really shocked by the portrait shot.  I mean obviously the 5D shot was going to be a lot better, but even on its own the XS portrait-mode shot was not good.  Could they not have made it look better than that?  Why was the subject so blurry?  I feel like the XS must have been capable of a better quality capture than that...?",Others
3884,Meh I'd say they're only really challenged by the Pixel 2XL in every condition and by the S9/Note 9 in low light. I hated how my Galaxy S8 would make peoples faces look like plastic even when I turned off every smoothing feature I could find.,Others
3885,"Apple's cameras share the spotlight at the top of the heap, lagging a bit behind other top contenders in areas like autofocus speed and low light performance. They're still tops when it comes to color reproduction, especially with skin tones.",Others
3886,"I think the low light and HDR improvements come from the A12 Bionic chip, as per the keynote",Others
3887,"Other than the display resolution, what else do you think is a downgrade?

What aspects of the phone is just a lateral move?",Others
3888,"I almost went with the X, but I figured the usable screen estate for media would be smaller, so I opted for the 8+.

I'd love to go for an XS Max tbh, I'll most likely wait until the 5G updates though.",Others
3889,"I’d say get the iPhone 11 next year *if* you seriously want the upgrade as you got the 8 plus , which is plenty for a couple of years...",Others
3890,I had the 8 plus for a year and bought the X just. Actually feels like a huge upgrade just for Face ID and the screen. Definitely worth it for the small amount I paid to switch. ,Others
3891,"I have the X, and I'm in the IUP so it would in a way cost me nothing to upgrade to the Xs, but I just... eh.  It's going to be basically the same phone.  I might just hold on to me X and then sell it next year to get the XI or whatever.  Or maybe I just don't need new phones anymore :-/",Others
3892,"I'm getting an AW S4 ... I kind of almost wanted an X last year and laughed at the price. My 7, like yours, is totally fine. And dude, if you haven't upgraded to iOS12 yet ... it adds on another two years of life to your phone, performance-wise, seriously. I think I'll just buy a new battery whenever this guy hits ~60% of its longevity. ",Others
3893,"Yeah nearly $1,500 for a phone is a biiiiit much. ",Others
3894,"They're good at making professional-*looking* reviews, but the content is often lacking. They semi-frequently get facts straight up wrong, and sometimes even differ from the written version. ",Others
3895,"There’s been something off about their general output lately. I think it’s because they lost several of their experienced journalists to other publications. 

There’s still some good coverage. I enjoy their space coverage and Dieter’s stuff. Nilay seems to be more hands off these days but his iPhone and HomePod reviews were good.

However, the new journalists need to brush up.  I haven’t been impressed by what they’ve done so far compared to the old ones.  I’m getting a it’s just a job vibe from them. 

Overall, their response to the PC building debacle was poor. I hope they’re working on fixing things behind the scenes. 

",Others
3896,"I think the verge should stop pretending they are a tech-reviewers. They are very good at giving the most important infos for the average customer, and should advertise themselves as that. ",Others

3898,"There were 13 people credited with making that PC build video. It wasn’t one person in isolation.

If they can’t even follow the directions in the hardware’s manual I wouldn’t expect any other products to be properly analyzed.",Others
3899,Verge means penis in French so there’s that. ,Others
3900,Your opinion of The Verge is a joke.,Others
3901,"1. It was not a stunt. Nilay even wrote a shitty mea culpa post on YouTube.

2. There were 13 people credited with making this video. He wasn’t working in a vacuum and everyone else should’ve put a hard stop on the video when he decided to put the computer together using a Swiss Army knife’s Phillips-head screwdriver attachment.",Others

3903,"So you missed the PSU being installed backwards, the RAM being installed incorrectly, and the radiator being installed without radiator fans. There are more issues, but these are biggies.",Others
3904,"Its because Apple scaled up everything, even the OS. I thing they did that to avoid scaling so apps will probably stay the same.",Others
3905,"If you're using autolayout correctly, nothing should need to be updated.",Others
3906,"I tell you what, the iPhone 6s Plus was the first phone I bought outright without carrier subsidy... and it's still rocking really well. I could easily do an entire year more and it still feel modern and current. Phones are just ""good enough"" these days. It's bells and whistles.

I've updated my phone every 2 years like clockwork since 2004, and now I'm going into year 4 on a phone. I never thought I'd have one that held up so long.",Others

3908,I kill my battery too on my X. From reviews it looks like it’s doing very well. ,Battery

3910,"Are you a boy or girl? Do you normally wear pants? My 7 plus (before my X) was big but never too big for my pocket. 

This year though, Apple made the only difference between the two battery and screen size alone. You won’t miss too much with the XS if you really can’t stand a bigger phone. ",Others
3911,Nope not really. Apple’s Upgrade Program includes AppleCare+ which is why it’s slightly more. Other than that there’s really no difference. I always do carrier just to have one less company to pay monthly lol. ,Others

I understood the rage when it was 16, but this sub is crazy....",Others

3915,Yes it is...,Others
3916,I wish Google would just release a Pixel app for iOS but that will probably never happen.,Others
3917,IPhone X was tied with Samsung S9+ for second. ,Others
3918,"I'm going from a 16GB iPhone 6 to a 256GB iPhone XS.

Pretty stoked.",Others
3919,The X is only really 10 months old and Apple put so much effort into making it such a big leap forward that the main selling points this year are the bigger Max and gold colour (both of which they probably could’ve released last year but I feel they deliberately saved as USPs for this year).,Others
3920,I can’t either because I can’t afford that shit. ,Others
3921,"Ill be going from a 6 to the XS, bit of a jump haha",Others
3922,I'm going from a 6 to the XS. I'm pretty excited. The larger size will take some getting used to ,Others
3923,I switched from a 6 to a 7 last year and I was blown away. My finance went from an SE to an X. That might have been to much of a jump for her to handle. She’s finally getting use to it. ,Others
3924,My 6S is still superfast. Biggest difference would be the camera.,Others
3925,I'm going from a 6s to a XS Max. Im stoked.,Others
3926,That would be the main reason I’d upgrade from a 7 but I just can’t decide yet! ,Others
3927,"Fellow 6 (plus) owner here. I’m excited to upgrade. This phone has served me _very_ well for very long, but its age is showing real bad. ",Others
3928,"It will be, you're going to be very very impressed. I promise you!",Others
3929,It will. Even the differences between last year’s X And this years Xs looks noticeable. ,Others
3930,"I work very closely with the camera tech on iPhones and it’s not “facial smoothing”; rather it’s aggressive noise reduction. It was a bit much on the X, I’m sad they didn’t tone it down. ",Others

3932,I'm about to switch from a Pixel 2XL to a XS and I'm sad about the camera too.,Others
3933,That’s why I was confused. The texture on the skin seemed more or less the same between the two shots (though I didn’t really like either cameras tone. She looked orange on the iPhone Xs and a smidge too gray on the pixel). ,Others
3934,"I hate the look though. Don’t want to walk around in public with them, ever. Ah well",Others
3935,"Sure there is. I want to see a review based off of someone who would load a normal ammount of applications and configure it for daily use. I'd like to see an evaluation after they've used it for a bit and point out what they like and what quirks the phone has. Every phone I've owned had a great first day / few days experience and after a bit they all showed their own bugs.

Unboxing a phone and powering it on isn't enough for me to trust the review as reliable. ",Others
3936,"Thanks for the heads up. We shall see! If this feature turns out to not have any issues, it seriously would be incredibe. ",Others
3937,"The Pixel 2 is $649.

It gives the longest updates in the Android world (3+ years), and the OLED display is better quality than any LCD iPhone (ie. any iPhone you can get for $649).",Others
3938,"I agree, ios12 feels very nice on my 7 plus. I think it’s just the hardware of better cameras and other features appeal to me. Aside from real world applications, I’m curious as to whether the hardware is REALLY a huge upgrade or not. ",Others
3939,"It’s just I’ve gotten tired of fitting a huge phone into my pocket and the small phone would alleviate that. The XS max I saw in one review doesn’t necessarily show more, just the same thing bigger ",Others
3940,"The ones on flicker were crops, I will check the other one thank you! 

The verge has some side by side with the pixel 2 and it still a bit behind it seems",Others
3941,"It’s not, just asked because they weren’t on the list.",Others
3942,No. Doesn't work even with Opera's VPN.,Others
3943,"Well, coming from a 6S, I'm pumped.  But I agree, if you have a X, I don't see a need to upgrade. ",Others
3944,"It’s similar but has bigger pixels, a new ISP and does more on phone computations for hopefully better results. But the cameras are extremely similar. ",Others
3945,The verge said it's better than the X but still not better than the pixel 2,Others
3946,Nobody _needs_ these phones. ,Others
3947,"Yup, it’s all over the internet in Gimbal forums and YouTube channels.

It really is quite unfortunate.",Others
3948,"Oh man! The XS and XS Max are out already? Damn, that was quick..",Others
3949,I've got a Milanese and a bracelet in 42mm so I'll be sticking with the larger size. I'd possibly go smaller otherwise. ,Others

The only facts that could go wrong tend to be knowing which other phones had certain features first or if the features can be turned on/off in settings but rarely the reviewers do any sort of deep dive into those features.

For example we got a lot of ""Lol, still only dual core"" when the iPhone 6s was released but [Anandtech was practically the only site that gave us the meaningful review of the chip](https://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review/40), and explained why it had killer specs with great performance.",Others

Honestly I’d HATE it if this is the case. Not only will we end up with a much worse offering as usual, but in so many countries in the world, English comprehension is great, and there is ZERO need to region lock this for their own original content.",Others
4272,I’m having the same issue and really irritated by this!,Others
4273,Very disappointing! My old eyes have trouble watching the workout on the small screens. I really wanted to be able to put it on my 77 inch tv using airplay to avoid having to buy an Apple TV.,Others
4274,"They’re just trying to get people to buy Apple TVs. Really disappointing how much $ you need to spend just to unlock the basic features of this damn app. I bought the watch, I have an iPhone, now I’m supposed to buy an Apple TV too??",Others
4275,I tried and it does not work for regular AirPlay. I was only able to mirror my screen to an Apple TV.,Others
4276,Looks as though regular AirPlay isnt compatible... Can only AirPlay to an Apple TV,Others
4277,"Not working on older generation Apple TV, which isn’t detected as a display, but using screen mirroring on iOS device.  The preview plays video and sound properly, youtube videos, but when the actual workout starts it shows the countdown and then only plays audio.  Seems like they have artificially restricted it from playing on older Apple TV’s to force users to upgrade.",Others
4278,"There’s a bug where the App Store thinks your iPad is incompatible with the fitness app. 

There’s no ETA for a fix.",Others
4279,I’ve been looking for that too. I went back on Apple’s website and the iPad is definitely in the list of supported devices...,Others
4280,Do you have an Apple Watch?,Others
4281,I downloaded the fitness app from the App Store on my iPad,Others
4282,I seem to recall this. When did this change?,Others
4283,"Fitness+ isn't competing for Peloton bike/tread customers, its competing for users of 100s of fitness subscriptions apps on the store. Pretty easy to get those ppl to convert to Fitness+ and much larger userbase.",Others
4284,I like a lot of the peloton instructors so getting used to new ones will be weird. The apple price point is lower than the peloton app so I have cancelled my peloton subscription. I did want a peloton bike but it was such a huge commitment and I am glad I didn’t buy one.,Others
4285,It's not out yet.,Others
4286,"IIRC, they usually get released at 1PM EST",Others
4287,iOS updates tend to be released at 6pm GMT.,Others
4288,"Me too. Im living in a third world country , would like to know as well",Others
4289,"It seems to work for me in a non-supported country on the Fitness app on my iPad. I haven’t signed up for it though, as I have to make my credit card convert to USD, which will have a fee.",Others
4290,Would love to know too. Heck the update notice even stated 'Apple Fitness + etc.'. Genuinely daft they don't just roll this out region free. If folks don't like the offering or don't speak English they just won't sub. Just don't see the logic behind this move.,Others
4291,Got it working in the Netherlands using an AOL account + setting my region to the US.,Others
4292,"Following. 

I tried switching region to the US which works for some features such as Apple News (not News+), but no joy. Seems like they are going to force a US iTunes account.",Others
4293,"Unless you share your activity with someone, nope. I don’t want people being able to search my name and look at my workouts like peloton lol",Others
4294,"As far as I know, I haven’t seen any roadmap or any information at all our launch in any other country outside of the current list countries.",Others
4295,I suppose at that point it would just be worth watching something on YouTube? No doubt the workout videos will be ripped online soon after launch (if there’s even a piracy market for that type of thing),Others
4296,The whole thing revolves around Apple Watch metrics while you workout.,Others
4297,You don’t need a watch. When you start a workout you can tell it to continue without one.,Others
4298,"Agree, the ridiculous thing is once you are signed up for the service you have the option to do the workouts without your Apple Watch. This service only exists to sell more watches and Apple TV. That’s pretty clear with them not offering airplay support or mirror with a cable to a tv.",Others
4299,"No, this is an entirely different app (Fitness) on the Apple TV box. It’s not part of the TV app on other devices.",Others
4300,"No, you need an actual Apple TV",Others
4301,I’m assuming if you can use it on your phone/iPad (if you have those) you can stream it to your fire stick.,Others
4302,"Update to iOS 14.3 and watchOS 7.2 in around an hours time (the usual time for software update releases), then open the fitness app?",Others
4303,"TV will invite you to connect your watch for the duration of the workout, so that will be fine (her watch = her subscription = all systems go). I don’t know about the iPad.",Others
4304,You’re exactly right. There’s no reason they can’t mention RPM or something to guide you. Unless they go for percentages of heart rate increases.,Others
4305,...because that’s not the point of curated workout classes with instructors?,Others
4306,I’m 100% with you. That was the most disappointing feature to me by a landslide. I absolutely love my “Get Up Mix” that Apple Music curates for me weekly and I was looking forward to using that. I might go back to Nike Training because of this.,Others
4307,It requires watchOS 7.2 which the series 0 can’t run or get.,Others
4308,It's incredibly difficult to be taxed to death by an instructor-led digital exercise class.,Others
4309,"It’s how you get fitter.
If you don’t push yourself your muscles don’t get fatigued as much as they get used to the workout. Kinda like how if you don’t walk for a while walking a might be tough but if you walk a mile every day it feels like nothing.",Battery

4311,"There’s generally something else going on in athletes who suffer sudden cardiac death: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, wolff parkinson white, Marfan’s, etc.",Others
4312,Updating the older low storage Apple Watches may be the single worst technology experience I've had using Apple devices or anything else in recent memory. Moving from an S3 to a newer one with a faster CPU and more storage is just night and day better.,Others
4313,The only way to update the fuckin thing is a complete reset. Although the series 3 is still a good smart watch... Apple shouldn’t sell a brand new 8gb model - it’s like selling a 16gb iPhone in 2020.,Others
4314,seriously so frustrating. my 3 works fine otherwise,Others
4315,Peloton has desk yoga workouts.,Others
4316,Yeah no airplay functionality. Sticking with Peloton. Absolute joke.,Others

4320,How do you get the app on the Apple TV? I don’t see it or know how to access it when it goes live lmao,Others
4321,"Yep, the Apple Watch authenticates everything. 

According to iJustine's review: you can bring your watch close to ANY Apple TV, even if the owner is not a subscriber, and it will kick off your workout with your account and settings on their screen.",Others
4322,"That makes sense; nice! Just seeing the reviews and videos coming in now, seems very polished overall. Obviously there are avenues they can take with features and the service in general, but as a base level Apple seemingly did well.",Others
4323,Does it require the latest 4K model or is the regular Apple TV going to work?,Others
4324,I think this would help some people.,Others
4325,"It wasn’t a rhetoric question, lol. Does anybody know? I used Polar Beats for a while but I don’t have their devices anymore.",Others
4326,"Have none of you encountered ‘influencers’ before? “Health and Lifestyle Gurus”? That smile, it’s literally 75% of all posts on Instagram. Can’t believe y’all just noticing it now!!",Others
4327,I disagree completely. Id say a couple of them but the rest are very genuine in my experience. Emma Lovewell is legit,Others
4328,"I mean, yeah, that's more realistic",Others
4329,Do they license music for the workouts? Probably the biggest reason for region locking,Others
4330,Looks like it’s not up yet. It is supported and I’ve seen it. Apparently they took it down,Others
4331,"Yeah it's available now, it wasn't available at / near launch.",Others
4332,"Did you purchase the watches on one Apple account/name? The reason I ask is because I actually bought my mom a watch last week and just updated to 14.3 and saw that I was offered 3 months. It was shipped to her location in her name, but billing was addressed to me. My mom hasn't updated yet, but I suspect she wouldn't be offered the 3 months since she didn't actually make the purchase.",Others
4333,"I had the same thing! There was nowhere to redeem as the service didn’t exist, right? The offer was stated at pre order for the new devices.",Others
4334,"That’s bullshit, the page on Apple’s site says “starting September 15th” for eligibility.",Others
4335,"Plus Apple One bundles... “oh, for just an extra £10 extra a month I can get 10x the iCloud storage, Fitness+, and News+, all for the whole family” will pull a lot of people in.",Others
4336,"100% 

I couldn’t be any more of a poster-boy in terms of Peloton’s demographics. I love cycling, I miss pre-covid competitive workouts, I work out daily in my garage, and I enjoy buying expensive tech. 

The cost of the bike and the membership is still goddamn insane to me. People who bought the bike will keep the membership for years and years to justify that cost, but the cost of entry for Peloton is massive.",Others
4337,"This is my hope, I have a few cad/speed sensors on my bike and it would be nice to use those.  Unfortunately on the appletv+, I can use those but not an external HR strap as it runs out of BT capability.  Maybe with the Apple Watch/Fitness Plus that would work.  As of now, it's Zwift on the phone that pairs with lots of things.",Others
4338,Not to mention that peloton machines have GymKit enabled so I’m assuming within time they’ll be able to be adaptive with Fitness+.,Others
4339,"Bingo. Chances are you’ve got an iPhone. Chances are good if you’re interested in fitness and have an iPhone, you have an Apple Watch. Chances are if you have both of those you probably have subs to some of the services. Chances are therefore good that going to the top tier Apple One sub will save money *and* give access to Fitness+. Activating Apple One is a pretty low barrier to entry compared to getting a Peloton.",Others
4340,"Change your point from Peloton users to ""Peloton owners"" and I absolutely agree. Owners of the bike alone not the tread are paying about $90 a month for the bike/required bike membership cost and are absolutely not the target. There are a large amount of digital Peloton users who would be considered part of the target demographic however.",Others
4341,"Yep. I've got a watch and a Sunny brand bike. I thought about Peloton app but it was a nightmare to figure out all the hoops to get the watch broadcasting HR and my cadence sensor up there too. I'm excited to have some classes available where everything just starts nicely and works together. I don't need anything hardcore, just some guidance to keep me motivated. For $7/month now it seems like a good deal if it works like I hope it does.",Others
4342,"This right here, I own a peleton bike outright, no monthly and I would definitely consider the fitness+ subscription because the $40 monthly peleton sub is pricey. I actually just use the mobile sub right now (15) and fitness+ is still cheaper. However I dont think I can move away from the features that the peleton sub offers in regards to equipment integration. Having the watch read metrics is great and all, but the constant workout/equipment integration throughout the workout is a really good combination.",Others
4343,"Strange. I’m kind of in the opposite situation: I have a US card linked to my account, but since I don’t live there now, the app doesn’t appear on any of my devices.",Others
4344,I’m pretty sure they add new content everyday like peloton. Since they just launched they have significantly less than peloton but they could get up to their level.,Others
4345,It would be awkward without the watch connected. The trainers incorporate your data and rings into the workout. There would be a lot of times where they are just talking nonsense if you didn’t track the data. I doubt Apple wants to look that silly.,Others
4346,But you have to have an Apple Watch to download the Fitness app to do that.,Others
4347,How’s that? Fire Sticks don’t have airplay,Others
4348,"Yeah I get that now, I assumed you could just follow along the videos and using an Apple Watch to record the workout data was optional.",Others
4349,Yeah the instructors even listen to the same songs and incorporate it in the class. It feels more interactive like this.,Others
4350,"Comment, don't defend everything Apple does without reason. Tell me why they shouldn't have a toggle for personal music use? Instructors should choose your workout and workout time, styles, and even diet. Not music lol.",Others
4351,">It shouldn't require a watch at all if it wants to compete with other services in the same space.

Unless you also want to sell watches ;)",Others
4352,"Agreed. You’re already paying $10 a month for the service, don’t see why I can’t just use it to watch the exercise videos and not track my metrics.",Others
4353,Because I just use it to receive text notifications. It suits my purposes at the moment and I haven't been compelled to upgrade (until now),Others
4354,Honestly that’s exactly what I thought.,Others
4355,"Thanks for the insight.

However I think it’s far too easy for everyone to say ‘just speak to your doctor’. Like, you know what that involves right? Several weeks waiting for an appointment and then they shout at you because there’s nothing actually wrong with you, you just want to chat about potential exercise. Like, how do they even test you for that?",Others
4356,Millions!! Millions everyday!,Others
4357,Yeah why is this?? I tried to upgrade without a reset and it failed entirely...,Others
4358,"I think it's fine to sell a cheap model with low storage as long as higher tiers are available. I was excited my series 5 came with so much, it's helpful for music but I know most people don't put anything on the watch.",Others
4359,"you have to download the fitness app separately on iPad, it's not included with the update",Others
4360,Me neither.,Others
4361,"It was added in the last beta build, will most likely go live to the public later today.",Others
4362,"[This](https://youtu.be/cZnsLVArIt8) may work for you. Otherwise, just search up what exercise you want on YouTube.",Others

4369,"No, I only wanted to do Fitness and don't personally care for the other services.",Others
4370,You can make the same argument about the iPhone,Others
4371,I would try it but I’m not going to buy an overly expensive Apple TV just for this,Others
4372,"Fitness app should pop up on your iPhone if you have a Watch, and for the iPad you have to manually install it from the App Store.",Others
4373,Oh completely understood - I was just shocked how wide the content gap is right now.,Others
4374,"Because if you aren’t going to shell out hundreds of dollars on Apple Watch, then you aren’t worthy.",Others
4375,"Because Apple only want to be seen offering the premier, not diluted experience. 

Same reason why they don’t sell cheap shit phone that can just about run iOS.",Others
4376,There’s A few reliable Amazon apps I think the one I use is airplaypnp or something like that and it mimics airplay and let’s your stick be found on iOS.,Others
4377,"Actually, fire sticks do have airplay. They added it recently.",Others
4378,Shoot yea I see that now. I hope that changes but likely won’t in the hopes to up the purchases of Apple TV’s.,Others
4379,I think it only shows 1 persons workout data but not sure on that. It does track everyone’s data tho in their own Apple Watch for the specific workout.,Others
4380,"You can get millions of exercise videos for free right now. These ones, link to a product, and no product equals nothing here for you.",Others
4381,A good doctor wouldn’t shout at you if you are asking if you are cleared for exercise. They want you to get healthier so they don’t have to see you die.,Others
4382,"Unless you have a preexisting health condition like a weak heart or something that’s very unlikely to happen. 

At that point if exercise is dangerous to you your doctor probably would have told you.",Others
4383,You’re more likely to be hit by a car or struck by lightning or die in a plane crash,Others
4384,It’s not fine when there’s not enough free space to update it - even with nothing installed on it,Others
4385,"Same! I did HIIT with Kim. She’s a beast and I love it! So glad they show an easier workout on the left, if you need to slow it down a bit (like me).",Others
4386,"I’m sure i can look it up, but kind elaborating on HomePod integration?",Others
4387,"Europeans in general don't ""fake"" niceness as much as Americans do",Others
4388,Oh interesting. Maybe they can get around some things if the music isn't in the session itself. Wonder how it works if you subscribe to Fitness+ but not Apple Music,Others
4389,Or a feature ;),Others
4390,"You mentioned being logged into the Fitness app on the Apple TV. Is the Apple TV logged into your account or hers? If its yours, then that would be strange not to see it on your phone as I would assume she's logged into her account on her own phone. If she's logged into the Apple TV, then I do not have any answer available to my knowledge.",Others
4391,Strange. Have you updated both your iPhone and your AppleTV? What happens if you go into your iCloud subscriptions in the Settings app on your iPhone?,Others
4392,"Hey mate, I was only getting the option for 1 month trial even though I bought a brand new Series 6, I un-paired & re-paired the watch & it worked.. Have you tried doing that yet?",Others
4393,"I actually tried that with a Wahoo trainer early this year. Transitioning my bike from ready-to-ride to sitting on the trainer was too much friction for me. I could buy another matching bike specifically for the trainer, but that would have cost about as much as buying a dedicated trainer like the Peloton. 

Zwift itself was great, but I ended up returning the Wahoo trainer and investing in more clothes for riding in cold/wet weather.",Others
4394,That was the justification for filling up my garage with powerlifting equipment. The total price of everything came out to the same as the annual gym membership that I was using five days a week.,Others
4395,"The biggest difference is that a Peloton is only used for working out and requires you to pay a subscription in order to use the device. 

iPhone with Apple Watch is still cheaper then cost of entry with Peloton and an iPhone is a much more versatile piece of equipment.",Others
4396,I don’t see the similarity at all. The iPhone is a multifunctional personal device that is necessary for a billion different daily necessities. Peloton bikes have 1 function.,Others
4397,You can do it on iPhone/iPad too.,Others

4401,"it does nothing of the sort. the other person has to start it on their watch manually, and it doesn't show up as a fitness+ workout.",Others

4432,does the otterbox block the speakers?,Others
4433,"I’ve seen in reviews that some cases scratch together with dust. I wonder how to prevent that. I would expect the case should be really tight in the first place to avoid dust getting in. Then, what the user could do is to remove the case frequently and clean. I have not had scratches on my watches with any case but I typically wear them for a limited time and then use band only. I put the case on only during some activities for some hours, max a day.",Others
4434,"I love my speigen thin fit. Doesn’t take from the shape of the watch, almost no added bulk, and has taken two nice hits this week no issues.

I’m also running a screen protector. Both have Been great.",Others

4436,"I use the Spigen and a couple others (can’t remember the brands) they’ve all been ok for my needs which is daily wear

https://imgur.com/a/62zps7y",Others
4438,"Yep, nearly had a heart attack when I saw my watch was scratched with the half body case. It’s only been a week with the otterbox but I think it’s probably the best one. Having said that though, the availability of cases for the watch is… average at best. Every case has some issues in some way which is a bit disappointing",Others
4439,Nope cutouts are almost perfect.,Others
4440,"Yeah, as mentioned in my other reply the availability of cases for the watch isn’t that great. 

Dust, scratches, touch sensitivity… they all have faults. I mean if my watch is going to get scratched with a case on it - might as well go naked and let it free. But just for a peace of mind’s sake I wanted a case and so far the otterbox seems to be the only reasonable one. 

It’s tight enough so particles or dust won’t get in but when I use a planer or a saw, very fine dust does get in so I use a micro fibre cloth or wet wipes and give it a wipe and I’m good to go.",Others
4441,"Yep, that way even when I use a case with built in screen cover dust or particles that get stuck under the case wont scratch my display as easily. And if you use a case without a screen cover you still have some protection",Others
4442,Definitely bulky but looks like it’s perfect to protect your watch while you work! Do you only use the case while you’re working?,Others
4443,wouldnt that be too tight? I also thought of this but im scared it might be too tight and scratch the body,Others
4444,Yep only for work. Gotta show off the watch when I’m going out haha,Others
4445,"Nope, if you use the tempered glass then it’ll definitely get in the way. That’s why with the film it’s a minimal difference and won’t cause any issues with the fit.",Others
4446,Would only expect significant updates for another year or two max. Look up the watch faces to make sure it has some you like/the workout functionality is still decent. Overall I would find it hard to recommend the 3 over the SE though.,Others
4447,"it'll certainly see at least watchOS 9 and probably 10 if apple does what everyone expects and finally discontinues producing and selling them this fall.

it's still a decent fitness-centric watch for the $120ish it's commonly on sale for, but the limited storage space (less than 2GB for music and such) and aging processor means it's not going to feel all that snappy these days.

and yeah, OS updates were a complete pain in the ass and often require wiping the watch completely to install due to 'insufficient storage space', but apple claims that this is less common of an issue with watchOS 8 and future updates (i still see complaints on this subreddit whenever there's a new update, but they don't seem near as frequent as before)",Others
4448,"It should’ve been discontinued in 2020. No one including experts in the tech media can fathom why Apple has kept it around, specially because Apple has simultaneously almost made it impossible to update watchOS on. Going into 2022 save up a little bit more money and at the very minimum you should be looking at an SE, or Series 5 or later. Do not buy the Series 3 it is effectively an already discontinued product.",Others

4451,"Got mine on Boxing Day 2021 a month later major cracks in the screen, I updated my phone to iOS 15 it automatically updates my watch to watch os 8.4 and everything is super slow and laggy. Honestly don’t get one.  I bought it new from Apple store. Im gonna see if they’ll take it back because it’s honestly so bad. Maybe mines a dud idk.

I’ve also found out recently that the series 3 still have the screen poppin issue.",Others

The stap would fail to sync to the phone meaning you were unable to actually track the data over any significant period of time and the data that was presented varied so wildly I just couldn't bring myself to recommend it to anyone.
