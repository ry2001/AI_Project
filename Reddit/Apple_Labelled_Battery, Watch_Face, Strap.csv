0,I am glad Apple Watch retained the round design. While a redesign could be interesting the current shape lends itself to comfort for all day wear. I was just at the gym a noticed how often my wrists pushed the watch but didn‚Äôt mess with my workout because of the round edges.,Others
1,"It seems like most people who already have an AW are unimpressed by this update, but as somebody who is getting a series 7 as their first smart watch, can I just say I‚Äôm hype as hell for the fast charging and no bezels? I don‚Äôt even mind the colors that much, I went with midnight and I think it looks great",Others
2,As someone who has a series 1 I‚Äôm definitely pumped! All of the reviews downplay it I think because the reviewers are techies that get review units each year. I will acknowledge I‚Äôm behind and it‚Äôs me that hasn‚Äôt updated. But I feel like we‚Äôre caught up in update culture. Where yes they could add more health features and a few more things but also the changes are so incremental because it‚Äôs such a good device in the first place.,Others
3,"I imagine the space gray aluminum was the single most popular Apple Watch model. Getting rid of it was a pretty naked attempt at trying to force people into a SS or titanium, but I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out.",Others
4,"Basically, it‚Äôs Apple Watch Series 6s?",Others
5,Oh man does the green look great. It's a very dark almost army green and looks stunning in the videos. Incredibly happy I went with that over midnight (which looks black with a slight blue at certain angles in direct sunlight).,Others
6,I'm still using Apple Watch 4. No motivation to buy that one. I will wait for a better update.,Others
7,"I will say, seeing videos of the watches in natural light does help - the starlight looks about like how I expected in that champagne kind of color and the midnight and green are both a lot darker than I expected which is a pleasant surprise.",Others
8,"Based on the videos, the midnight looks pretty black at first glance. You see the blue if you look at it carefully/in the right light. Might look different in person.",Others
9,The keyboard is the seller for me,Others
10,"I watched a couple of reviews and cancelled my preorder. Seeing it in real videos now, even with the thinner bezels it still just looks like the same watch which I‚Äôve never loved the design of. My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign, but I still decided to put an order in. But the lack of neutral colours on lower end bands forced me to go for the milanese loop along with the stainless steel to get something I liked the look of, and at that price it simply isn‚Äôt worth it for me. I‚Äôll wait for the series 8 to see if it has the new design and neutral bands.",Others
11,"If you have a Series 3 like me and were considering upgrading because of dreadful performance‚Ä¶. I strongly recommend installing watchOS 8.0.1 before ordering a new watch. 

It‚Äôs a major performance improvement and I‚Äôm now thinking of hanging on to this S3 for a little longer.",Others
12,Waiting for another 38mm model. Or 36 w a full screen. These are just too bulky.,Others
13,"Anyone who says this is an ‚ÄúS‚Äù year really doesn‚Äôt get how S models work.

The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is the literal opposite of an S year.",Others
14,Even with these minor updates since last 2-3 years. AW is the best smartwatch and there is nothing even close. Shows you how other companies are far behind in the competition.,Battery
15,I wonder if it still works with the Belkin 3-in-1 Magsafe dock,Others
16,I have a space gray S4. I was considering going to the S7 but no way am I paying for $800 for Space Black Titanium. Tim Apple has let me down on this one,Others
17,"As an owner of a Series 6 Nike Edition watch, I'll be holding out for the future release that includes a blood glucose sensor.      With the cost of the sensors that you can wear for 14 days of continuous blood glucose monitoring, the Apple Watch series that does that feature will be well worth the upgrade.",Others
18,"It's bizarre to me how much complaining there is about the Starlight and Midnight color options in this thread for a few reasons:

1) They're still super close to Silver and Space Grey. A hint of gold or blue does not make them ""not neutral,"" and anybody who isn't up on Apple color conventions is still going to look at them and think they look silver or dark grey. 

2) Why does it matter if they're neutral in the first place? You're wearing a computer strapped to your wrist and no color/material combination is going to make it not look like an Apple Watch. You aren't going to pass it off as a Rolex. Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like. No, the Space Black Ti model is not going to look more professional/less gadgety than the Midnight Al.",Others
19,Did anybody get the Gold SS (or any SS) review models?,Others
20,"This is the 2nd apple device that I may upgrade too only because I regret my previous purchase. 


I got the iPhone 13 pro only because I regret getting the iPhone 12 with no telephoto lens, and I might get the series 7 only because I regret getting the SE with no always on display. Neither seem like enticing options if I made the correct choice with the 12 pro/series 6 last year.",Others
21,so the s7 SiP is the same as the s6 SiP???,Others
22,"I ordered one because It‚Äôs more trouble to buy a cheaper 6 from going to another country rather than get the 7 delivered to my door. 

First AW btw. I‚Äôve only used it briefly for a week because a friend borrowed it to me so I can get a reference to compare it to the gwa2 I had.",Others
23,I‚Äôm excited for my watch coming this Friday. Going to be upgrading from a Series 1!,Others
24,Have a stainless with Milanese loop 45mm coming as my first Apple Watch. I‚Äôm very excited!! I don‚Äôt know too much about the features which makes me even more excited!,Others
25,My new 7 is taking forever to charge and doesn‚Äôt hold a charge.  What chargers is everyone using and how long to charge?  15 mins?!  I wish!,Others
26,So that whole announcement about it having really durable crystal across the board was a lie and it‚Äôs just glass and crystal on the stainless still?,Others
27,"Well the hands on real world footage has shown clearly what I was worried about

The screen going so far edge to edge with such a curvy bit of glass looks weird

Looks to me like the screen is too big for the watch. The way the reflective edge obscures the display just doesn‚Äôt look all that great

The display no longer looks like its on top of the glass, it looks like its trapped behind the glass

And now I‚Äôm convinced that this will look great with a flatter redesign that I suspect we will get next year (if it wasn‚Äôt originally planned for this year)",Others
28,"I mean just get a Series 6 which will probably discounted by retailers or off eBay. I got a series 5 stainless steel in January, heavily discounted and can see myself holding onto this for a while",Others
29,"Yeh I also thought this with the ‚Äúleaked‚Äù design, them squared edges don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôll be too nice when bending my wrist. And yes before anyone mentions it, I know traditional, analog can watches have squared edges and are bulky",Others
30,This is a good summary. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶basically it for changes.,Others
31,"Coming from a wifi only Series 4, it‚Äôs a slightly better upgrade to the 7 cellular. Other than going for walks without my phone with me now, I doubt I‚Äôm going to be using it any differently.",Others
32,Since when aren‚Äôt black and silver neutral colours?,Others
33,"You‚Äôre definitely part of the target audience for the Series 7. I think people forget that for anyone thinking about upgrading from a Series 4 or older, this is a pretty significant upgrade.",Others
34,Exactly the same here!,Others
35,Same here! My first one. I'm only bummed by the removing of space grey color but i'll live with the midnight,Others
36,"Very excited here as well! I am upgrading from an OG Galaxy Watch. I was a recent Android convert, and this will be my first Apple Watch. 

Looking forward to the integration and overall polish, as that was dearly lacking on the OG Galaxy Watch.",Others
37,"I‚Äôm excited for mine, finally broke my series 2 a couple weeks ago",Others
38,"It's just like phones - it's an incremental upgrade from the previous generation, but it's really aimed at people who haven't upgraded for 2+ years.  For them, it's a large jump.",Others
39,I mean I‚Äôm hyped as well upgrading from a Series 0 lmao‚Ä¶,Others
40,"Yeah, I'm digging that midnight. Waiting for mine to arrive.

Up to everyone's taste ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Others
41,"Same here, I think all the people with recent watches are missing the point. The tech is mature enough that upgrading every year or two is pointless and wasteful.",Others
42,You should see the screenshots and texts between me and my buddy.  We are very excited for midnight,Others
43,Basically the Verge‚Äôs video conclusion lmao.,Others
44,I‚Äôll be coming form a S4. So there‚Äôs some new shit for me.,Others
45,Your hype is totally justified! I jumped on the AW train last year with the S6 which was similarly received and I felt just as you described. I hope you love your new S7!,Others
46,I wonder if they‚Äôll also phase out silver and space grey on the new MacBooks (in favour of Starlight and Midnight). Currently I don‚Äôt think any of the recently refreshed products have any silver/space grey aluminum which is a bit odd.,Others
47,"Removing neutral colors (black and white) from the base iPhone 13 lineup this year didn‚Äôt seem to slow down sales, even though they were probably the most popular colors.",Others
48,"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve calculated these losses go one they didn‚Äôt even need to build a new chipset. This, internally, is the same processor then the S6. That‚Äôs where most of the money in R&D goes, and they didn‚Äôt need to spend a single dollar this year on making it better.",Others
49,"The only reason I bought a model other than the aluminum was for the sapphire screen. In hindsight, it was worth it, but I wish they would let all models have the sapphire rather than just the premium",Others
50,"> I think this is going to backfire and make people sit this generation out  

Yeah right now I'm waiting to see if any S6 deals are on the go (UK) or go cheapsies on the SE. Was more than happy to go in on the big new thing but what a jip.  

Edit: None have seemingly dropped from the current price that I've seen yet but likely will once they get S7 stock...",Others
51,"Of the three people who I know who have apple watches, they‚Äôre all getting midnight and are excited after todays pics and videos",Others
52,I doubt it. Some of these colors are REALLY neutral. Heck apparently the very green one is more or less gray in anything but ideal lighting.,Others
53,Don‚Äôt think apple will ever bring space Grey back for any of their products. It‚Äôll be more of graphite. A darker shade. I‚Äôll expect MacBook Pro to follow suit. Basically all of the pro products will have similar colour range. AW SS imo falls under the pro range,Others
54,This is definitely one of the Apple Watches ever released,Others
55,"Ehh I'd only expect spec bumps for an S. 20% larger screen, faster charging but no spec bump is... it's own minor thing.",Others
56,and it's not like the Series 6 was anything more than a Series 5 with a gimmicky Spo2 sensor.,Others
57,"Same here. I can‚Äôt figure out why the green isn‚Äôt more popular. I got the clover solo loop but man, the black bands paired with the green watch sure look great.",Others
58,"I wasn‚Äôt complaining, I missed preorder by far, but green was still available for day 1 store pickup by midday.",Others
59,What‚Äôs the battery health on your S4?,Battery
60,I‚Äôm definitely getting the series 8 if my watch makes it to then.,Others
61,I broke my Apple Watch 4 a couple months ago and have no motivation to buy this. The incremental watch updates are killing me.,Others
62,"I‚Äôm totally happy with the physical design of it, but there‚Äôs nothing this year that makes it a worthwhile upgrade. For me, the two biggest things that I‚Äôd be excited for are either a significant upgrade to battery life, or some new health-tracking features enabled by new hardware. Anything else is kinda ‚Äúwell I guess a slightly larger screen is nice but not $400 nice‚Äù.",Others
63,"> My enthusiasm for the watch was dampened significantly when there was no redesign

I just cannot understand the logic behind wanting redesigns on things just for the sake of having them redesigned... It's a smart watch with an extremely limited form factor, what are you expecting? Will square sides chuff your bits?",Others
64,Hard edge Apple Watch would suck for working out / sports,Others
65,"Same, cancelled and ordered couple new bands instead to clench that consumer thirst",Others
66,"Same. When this was announced I was all in. Then as time went on, the shiny idea went away and my s3 still does what I need and doesn‚Äôt cost me $800. Gonna use that to replace my aging iMac",Others
67,Yeah I agree. I cleared everything and installed 8.0.1 and it feels like a new watch somehow. I‚Äôm still going to check out my ss series 7 when it comes in for a week then make my decision.,Others
68,"> The entire point of an S model is the exterior looks the same and the internals have changed.

This is not the official definition though. And no one is calling it the ""S"" model like it is an official thing. 

> This is the literal opposite of an S year.

The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature. None of those really apply here.",Others
69,‚Äú but I need something new and drastic every year!!!!!!‚Äù,Others
70,I think all of us that use an analog watch face agree that its ridiculous that we don't have 120Hz or higher yet. Watching the second hand move on my current Apple watch only compels me to stab my eyes out with an Apple Pencil.,Others
71,"If you‚Äôre able to, couldn‚Äôt you get a Series 6? I just got one, it‚Äôs a great device and one that could last me a few generations. I imagine the series 6 will do the same for you.",Others
72,">It also doesn‚Äôt help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS

From what I've seen the reviews, Midnight honestly [looks closer to black](https://i.redd.it/xc3cprrt19t71.jpg) than Space Gray ever did. It has a slight blue sheen in certain lighting, but it's super subtle to the point where black bands match it better than the Midnight ones.

It's almost making me regret getting black Ti, but I still think that also looks great so I'm going to keep it for now.",Others
73,I mean the ‚Äúgraphite‚Äù stainless steel model seems pretty black to me,Others
74,‚Ä¶so get aluminum‚Ä¶?,Others
75,">	Embrace that you're wearing an Apple Watch and get a color that you like.

The colour that I like is no longer available. That‚Äôs the problem.",Others
76,"I think this is just all wild speculative whining driven by the absence of being able to hold a watch in your hand and having to go by product images online. As soon as they're released, I expect very few actual complaints in real world use.

I've been a participant in this before: When every Apple 'news' site broadcasted that the MagSafe Duo was possibly incompatible with the iPhone 13 Pro I was aghast and fretting over it. Only to receive the phone and charge it every night on it without any issue. Not exactly the same, but its no point in getting so worked up over something until you actually have it in your hand.",Others
77,It looks like everyone has been getting the green one for their reviews so far.,Others
78,"Yep, 7 only",Others
79,The sapphire is more scratch resistant but also heavier and more brittle (prone to shattering). The ion-glass is much better for the ‚Äúsports/fitness‚Äù model.,Others
80,"I know it adds a little bulk, but the there are so many bumper styles out for for super cheap.  I‚Äôd highly recommend; they‚Äôve saved my A3 on dozens of occasions.",Others
81,"I agree it looked that way, but if you take a close look at the watch when it's on your wrist, it's really the sensor on the bottom that has contact on your skin, not the edges of the watch. In fact, short of bending my wrist straight up, I can't even get myself to contact the sides.  That's just to say that I think the more angular design wouldn't be an issue in practice.",Others
82,"Oh if you have a series 3 there‚Äôs no question you should upgrade. 

Also Tommy rules!",Others
83,"He did address battery life, it‚Äôs the same.",Battery
84,He mentions battery life in the video.,Battery
85,"he addressed on battery and recharge 

while battery life is the same. quick charge fits his life style much better",Battery
86,"there's not anything new there really. battery life is the same as it's always been ('fine' to 'mediocre' depending on how you use the Watch), but it charges faster so you can just do a quick charge at night or in the morning if you find some benefit to sleep tracking and be fine.",Battery
87,Also watch your bands. I used a sports band and jumped off a rock about 10 feet up and lost my watch on impact (on the second jump). The river was not clear and it was lost forever.,Others
88,There is no black aluminum. The midnight version has a blue tint to it.,Others
89,"Coming from a SS series 4, I‚Äôm pretty excited for the upgrade.",Others
90,"This!
I‚Äôve got a 3, so this would be a gigantic upgrade. Wouldn‚Äôt be bummed at all.",Others
91,"Exact same as you, going to try and order friday since I missed preorder timeline for friday pickup",Others
92,Same I‚Äôm excited - also getting my first cellular model,Others
93,"Oddly, the new iPad mini has Starlight and Space Grey.",Others
94,"I doubt they'd do that. Maybe we'll see MacBooks come in color options similar to the iMacs, but I don't think they're going to release new colorways to match watches. The watch is unique among Apple offerings because it's a fashion accessory as much as it is a tech product. The people who think all Apple products should be color-matched are looking at it the wrong way, imo. The watches need to be matched with clothing, not MacBooks.",Others
95,"At least you can (and most likely do) put a cover on a phone, with the watch you're stuck with what you've got.",Others
96,"For me the color matters much more for a watch than a phone. You‚Äôre likely not putting a case on it, and it‚Äôs part of your outfit.",Others
97,I‚Äôn from NL and found a 40mm Series 6 on Amazon for 299 a few weeks ago. That was enough reason for me the take the S6 and not wait for the S7. Best choice ever after seeing these reviews.,Others
98,"4s^3 is impossible, it should be 4s^2 3d^1",Others
99,">I can‚Äôt figure out why the green isn‚Äôt more popular

The answer to the question ""Why isn't x color more popular"" when it comes to fashion accessories is pretty simple. Most colors outside of black, white, gold, and brown just don't go together nicely with most people's clothing choices, and this green color on the Series 7 looks like it unfortunately falls into that camp.

Never mind the fact that conventional mechanical watches are almost always found in those colors as well.",Others
100,"I went in 50/50 between green and midnight but I ended up looking in my closet to make up my mind. The green would work with my weekend clothes but it‚Äôs just not right for my black, blue, and gray heavy business attire, and (rather unfortunately) I‚Äôm in the business clothes many more hours than my casual clothes during the Monday through Friday time period when I‚Äôll actually need to use a watch. Still would have preferred graphite to match my 13 Pro but I‚Äôm staying open minded about the midnight.",Others
101,My S4 that I got replaced in Feb 2019 is at 85%,Others
102,How about 400 minus what you get from selling your 6 ?,Others
103,I‚Äôm with you.  Plus I don‚Äôt want a mini iPhone looking thing on my wrist.  The current Apple Watch looks amazing and does not need a redesign,Others
104,"It‚Äôs important to me that it looks good, and for me the rumoured redesign was a significant aesthetic improvement over the current design.",Others
105,"I‚Äôm on an s4 so I have those, and yeah, totally minor things. The only reason I‚Äôm even entertaining updating is I‚Äôve been dying for the always on screen, and my watch is getting fairly beat up after years of daily use‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt like the colors of the aluminum and would never go to the stainless, and the idea of buying last years product when it‚Äôs still so expensive just seems wrong to me.

I really wanted to upgrade, but everything about this watch feels like a minor revision, and that they plan for something much more significant next year. And if not, well, we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶",Others
106,">The literal opposite of an S year would be a redesign, a new sensor, or a new ""valuable"" feature.

TouchID was a pretty valuable feature. And as far as redesigns go, it's S7 is probably more substantial than going from iPhone 6S to 7 was. Same with XS to 11.",Others
107,"Not saying it‚Äôs a definition, but that‚Äôs always how S models worked.

3GS identical to 3G
4S identical to 4
5s near identical to 5, with home button changed for Touch ID 
6s identical to 6
XS identical to X

It would make more sense to call the S6 ‚ÄúSeries 5s‚Äù than to call Series 7 a ‚ÄúSeries 6s‚Äù",Others

But on the other hand. All the excitement behind the last 5 updates all come at once now so I‚Äôm still pretty hyped!

Edit: I meant to also add. It‚Äôs the software non compatibility for me. Having a work focus turn on, on my phone, and receiving zero work notifs on my watch is not a mood. Plus a few other things as I‚Äôm now like 2 software cycles behind haha",Others

Fair enough! Worth mentioning that one of these options is used though and probably won't come with the same warranty and might not be in the same condition or have the same battery health.

Also not sure what that has to do with if the Series 7 is worth it or not.

322,"They're so bulky though. I have a 15$ digital casio, wear it every day, and I feel like I'd scratch a g shock way more just because of the size. And I can buy 4-8 for the price of a cheaper g-shock.",Others
323,Same. But I was looking at some of the higher end models...$1000+!,Others
324,"No, in fact, you can't even use it. When you first power the watch up it just shows a splash screen that essentially says ""Hi, pair with iphone plz"". It literally can't do anything except show that screen until its paired with an iphone.",Others
325,Id go with a new se over used 5.,Others
326,"I see no value in the ECG (mine has that feature) or the O2 sensor. ECG is like an annoying 30 second process that doesn‚Äôt tell you anything and uploads a file to your phone to show your doctor or something... I used it one and never tried it again.

331,Not if you have an iphone.,Others
332,is that vaguely relevant to the article?,Others
333,Stop thinking of it as a watch. It‚Äôs clearly much more than that. You don‚Äôt need some fancy chronometer to last 50 years either. Any cheap Casio will likely still be working fine in 50 years.,Others
334,"My 15$ Casio works for 10 years without a battery replacement and has functions and accuracy which a high end mechanical chronometer will not have.


A high end chronometer is *never* bought to keep time in these times. It's main function is being a status symbol for people who value that. And also as a fashion accessory... If those two things were irrelevant to the owners of such clocks, an inexpensive quartz digital clock is far superior.

And I also have some *better* mechanical watches, but the casio is my ""daily"" watch I wear everywhere and the mechanical watches are for more formal occasions (where I guess I show off my wealth? ): ).


The Apple watch is a bit of both, because it definitely does offer high tech functionality no classic or digital watch ever could, and it is also definitely used as a status symbol.",Others

336,"If they enabled that on the SE, the S6 wouldn't have any selling points, apart from the oxygen sensor (which is not alot).",Others
337, If it does turn out to be a software lock the developers in r/tweakbounty and r/jailbreak will probably come up with something.,Others
338,They have identical screens but aren't the guts basically a Series 4? That watch didn't have an always on display either. So maybe it's not the screen that's the limiting factor.,Others
339,"Not really. The Series 6 (and last year‚Äôs Series 5) have a little bit of extra tech in the displays that allow for the display to downclock to as low as 1 frame per second instead of running at the conventional 60 fps. If they left the screen on at 60 fps all the time, the watch‚Äôs battery would be dead within only a few hours.",Others
340,"Is it really? That's kinda a dick move, I always thought that the SE just has a cheaper screen than the S6.",Others
341,The SE would have the same always on brightness as the S5 because they have the same chip (half as bright as the 6). Tbh I bet someone could jailbreak that into watch OS for the SE.,Others
342,"There could be different chip binning, missing chip features and a cheaper battery. A tear down will tell us the truth but it‚Äôs all speculation now.",Battery
343,"Is it identical?  Because Apple built some low power tech into the Series 5 to have it be always on, maybe they‚Äôre using the screens from Series 4?",Others
344,"Kind of like Tesla vehicles.  Everything is there under the $30k car, you just need to spend $10,000 more to unlock the battery in order to go 100 miles more.",Others
345,"If that‚Äôs true, could jailbreak enable it?",Others
346,"It‚Äôs not just software, there‚Äôs some sort of chip in the S5 and 6 that locks the frame rate to 1fps while the screen is dimmed in always on mode. But that‚Äôs the most important factor in a smart watch to me so sadly I can‚Äôt imagine buying an SE.",Others
347,">Which is honestly really stupid since the S6 and SE have identical screens. It‚Äôs just software locked.

Isn't this a big part of how they make money. You know, pursuade their consumers to buy yet another iteration of something that already exists?",Others
348,"Functionality wise? Sure. But anesthetics are a major reason smartwatches finally took off. Sadly, a lot of people couldn't care less about 2 weeks battery on a watch if the screen looks as unappealing as a sticker.",Others
349,"Argument lost at ‚Äúnot as bright and pretty‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs supposed to be a premium watch, it‚Äôs gonna have good screen. More fitness-only watches can get away with darker screens.",Others
350,I think you can turn it off too.,Others
351,Apple has always been really good at [price anchoring](http://changingminds.org/disciplines/marketing/pricing/price_anchoring.htm).,Others
352,"I think that‚Äôs the thing, they priced it so close to the 6 to encourage people to get the 6 instead. If I didn‚Äôt buy the 3 last November, I‚Äôd have got the 6 tbh",Others
353,"Is it actually? I've been thinking about getting an Apple watch for a few months now, so I'm curious why the aod is a big deal. Doesn't the display light up right when you raise your wrist, or is there a lag or something?",Others
354,Got a s5 with LTE off eBay for 350 ... 44 size about 4 months ago,Others
355,I actually got it specifically because it DIDNT have AOD. I have two little kids and they become infatuated with my watch if the display lights up. SE was the perfect upgrade from my very battered S3 and I‚Äôve been loving it.,Others
356,"I‚Äôm saving up $400 for the Series 7, but when that comes out I‚Äôll probably find myself in the same boat, willing to settle for the Series 6 for cheaper, or really the Series 5 for the AOD. I love that I was able to get the Series 2 from my friend for $100 used, but I‚Äôm ready for the upgrade. So anyway, $400 is a lot to pay, and I don‚Äôt do payments on stuff like that, so I‚Äôm saving an extra $35 monthly at the moment by taking 30 minute lunch breaks (instead of my comfortable hour-long ones) and clocking in, and hopping to a few minutes early.",Others
357,the fact that you need to raise your arm and have that little delay is reallyyyyyyyyyy annoying. i bet they tested this over and over to make sure it's true and feature locked it. i got other watches without always on display and i absolutely can't use it as a watch. it drives me crazy.,Others
358,No not particularly. Low light OLED‚Äôs can be incredibly efficient. Most of the power consumption is not from displaying stuff but rather processing stuff using the cpu. White OLED‚Äôs are the most efficient anyway since it is a simple open channel without color processing. Power consumption is minimal,Others
359,"I think it also only turns on automatically if you enter that you are older than a certain age (e.g. 65... not sure exactly), otherwise you need to turn it on in the settings.",Others
360,"I have the Series 4 watch and the fall feature is iffy. It‚Äôs gone off when I crush garlic or flop on the couch, but not when I legit collapsed while running. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve improved the feature. I hope so.",Others
361,I take it you need the 4G version for that? Unless Apple has conjured up some intergalactic black magic I'm unaware of...,Others
362,Ah the series 4 the one that was the first Apple Watch to have fall detection.,Others
363,Yeah I care more about my grandpa than the money I give to Apple.,Others
364,Same. I‚Äôve had the SE for a week now and I‚Äôm really enjoying it,Others
365,"At this stage even if you don't need the extra features of an SE or higher, the S3 just doesn't have enough onboard storage. Every update requires you to wipe it, update then restore these days.",Others
366,3 to 4 was a huge upgrade due to the larger screen.,Others
367,It‚Äôs always a bit funny to see people right paragraphs analyzing why they need a new ‚Äúanything tech here‚Äù,Others
368,"I find the sleep tracking on the Fenix really bad.  I have worn both the Fenix and the Apple Watch (3rd party app Autosleep) at the same time and the Apple Watch consistently shows more accurate results.  This may vary for others, but the Fenix was so bad I didn‚Äôt bother tracking sleep with it.",Others
369,That never really happens but if it did it‚Äôs not worth the price difference for the two times a year I may need it :),Others
370,"Fair points, nice that people have the choice now.  Everyone can evaluate if the feature difference is worth the cost.",Others
371,Google it.  People are showing watch results vs proper pulse oximiter results. The top of the wrist is a poor spot to measure O2 sat.,Others
372,Just go read any of the plethora of views. It's inconsistent and doesn't work at all half the time. It's also not medically certified. It's not medically accurate.,Others
373,I have a s5 and have the brightness on medium because high is too bright. I'm shocked anyone thinks it needs to be brighter. on high there's no privacy and when the environment is dark it makes me look like an idiot. there's no ambient sensor.,Others

375,"The used market for Apple watches is insane though, I bought a series 5, 44mm excellent condition, LTE, for $230 on Facebook marketplace. I‚Äôm not really sure why but Apple watches sell like hot cakes on there.

378,That‚Äôs cool. I actually got outta my charge 2 to get my S3. Had it for a year now and am PISSED to see that it‚Äôs already practically outdated (not getting any watch faces except the shit ones. Would kill for infograph which would be an upgrade over modular),Others
379,"You guessed ‚Äòer, Chester. Haven‚Äôt heard that name version of it before ever tbch. But yea, I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt help, even if it gives me a quick little picture.

I do watch my HR sometimes. Hell, it‚Äôs the middle part of my modular screen that I never get off of LOL.

But yea, it was a cryoblation, not a heat ablation so there‚Äôs like less that a 2% chance it comes back... and if I‚Äôm honest it probably would‚Äôve come back by now and I would‚Äôve noticed at least once lol.",Others
380,He wrote that it is important *for him*.,Others

388,I think it‚Äôs an appropriate comparison since they are competing in the same space. If you want to be in the Android space don‚Äôt expect a decent watch unless you go Samsung.,Others
389,"I completely agree. I had to replace multiple fitbits, sometimes in as little as 6 months. My Series 1 Apple Watch has never given me a bit of  trouble and has a lot more features.",Others

398,"It does not, and this is the biggest reason I'd recommend people get the SE instead. The SE will likely also be supported longer due to having the new screen form factor and internal bits.",Others

401,Good counter-point,Others
402,"The always on is annoying it‚Äôs just well...always on. I like when it only turns on when I look at it. Also, there is no real need for one. I only use it when I‚Äôm at work to quickly check a text or respond because I‚Äôm technically not allowed on my phone. I hardly use it if I‚Äôm not at work or running which to be honest I hardly do lol",Others
403,"For sure, there‚Äôs a lag. You get used to it. The ‚Äúalways on‚Äù feature (should be standard really) isn‚Äôt with an upgrade imo. And there‚Äôs not much you use your watch for anyway, yes there‚Äôs apps, but most need the phone nearby or activated by phone first, so it‚Äôs kind of redundant, just use the phone.

The Watch is fine, but at nearly $1000 (gps + cellular + additional watch bands + protector cases) you can get a good classic time piece that‚Äôll hold it‚Äôs value better (Apple Watch/Android Watches lower in value so much faster) and likely has a better design (fashion) and character.",Others

444,it does and it works 100% but with AOD you always have a clockface on the watch whether youre holding it up or not,Others
445,"It just looks nicer imo, it looks like a watch instead of a screen strapped to your wrist",Others

I also kind of figure that with the 7 technically being a complete case redesign (even though it largely looks the same) we aren‚Äôt going to see some wild redesign next year; Apple will probably want to use the new design for at least 2-3 years.

If the comparison to the S6 is the subject of the entire video then that reviewer is simply bad at their job. Catering to annual upgraders is ignoring the vast majority of their audience. The average shopper is either buying an Apple Watch for the first time or upgrading from a much older version. At most, the S6 comparison should be a one minute section of the review and the rest of the time should be spent showing off *all* the features of the S7, regardless if the same features have been available on the previous generation.",Others

Another reviewer pointed out earlier this week from Apple Watch 4-5 there were even less upgrades compared to what the 7 is getting.

912,Not on the aluminum versions.  Midnight is the closest to black but so far the images suggest it is more of a very dark blue vs the black/space gray of before.  You need to go up to the stainless steel or titanium to get space black or graphite.,Others

914,That is correct,Others
915,The screen size from 4 to 5 is the same right? I could understand upgrading from a 4 because by then the battery is degrading and the watch is probably a little slow due to bulky WatchOS upgrades,Others

950,"More like the former I guess. It's not that the features they added weren't good (they are), but I know for me personally the watch doesn't change enough year to year to upgrade every year.

Except you can't look at it objectively like this. Size differences are all about perception.

We're barely getting a larger case, but we're getting 20% more screen space, with greatly reduced bezels.

So the ‚Äúalways on‚Äù (when it‚Äôs dimmed and you aren‚Äôt using it) brightness of the 5 is 200 nits but the 6 is 500. There are photos of how much brighter it is in the sunlight.,Others
1048,Are you just intentionally ignoring the part where they‚Äôre talking about the always on display?,Others
1049,"They‚Äôre actually correct, you are wrong. The always on display can now be up to 500 nits. All the displays (NOT THE AOD) go up to 1000 nits...... they‚Äôre specifically talking about the AOD, not displays in general..",Others

The new blood o2 readings will prob be a big boost for stuff like that in autosleep.",Others

So any watch will do. The battery on my S4 is fine for sleep tracking, I just charge it when showering.",Others

1056,"The display is called ""the always on display"" that is different than referring to the ""always on"" mode of the display.

Are you just intentionally ignoring where Apple clearly qualified **up to** 2.5x brighter in **AOD mode** in **direct sunlight**, and this website threw out all those qualifiers and false reported.",Others

Apple doesn‚Äôt specify the exact percentage or nits the AOD can drop too. Why?  The AOD brightness is dynamic and isn‚Äôt ‚Äústuck‚Äù or set to a particular percentage, however, the average brightness for AOD was about 200 nits. Now, under direct sunlight or other bright lighting situations, it can go as high at 500.",Others

1071,It‚Äôs really a fitness and productivity machine. It‚Äôs built for your well-being and fitness goals and also making quick reply‚Äôs and quick notifications easier to accomplish. So if you aren‚Äôt using it to streamline your work emails and calendars or to improve your health metrics tracking goals you won‚Äôt get much from it besides a pretty way to see the time.,Battery
1072,I‚Äôve never heard smart watches pitched as divorcing you from your phone. Maybe just saving some battery. It‚Äôs also like a watch so it‚Äôs like a fashion statement which is like the only point of the higher-end models like you bought. I use mine a lot for the Home app and flashlight and mainly it lets you see if a notification is dumb or actually worth taking your phone out. I hear a lot of people like them for the alarm because it just taps you on the wrist. Mainly I feel like you paid more and expected more tech but you actually just got more fashion.,Others
1073,"Suppose taking advantage of the fitness goals/functionality is among the least of reasons as to why I‚Äôd ever purchase one? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the work out tracker is kind of handy when I go out and do my long walks and my swimming.",Others

Apple Heath can track *everything* down to the length of your stride, the oxygen level of your breathing, the quality of your sleep, the rhythmic pattern of your heart‚Ä¶ and put it into a high quality, trackable data set that you can share with your doctor. Apple Watch is designed at its core to improve your understanding of your health. It‚Äôs the main reason people purchase this device. Beyond the health tracking features, the productivity features are almost a basic given. Complications are a cool way to track many things at once so play around with watch faces to find what gets the most of our if it for you. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a watch. You shouldn‚Äôt even notice it until you‚Äôre supposed to notice it.",Others

1080,Charging a phone is already annoying enough. I can't wrap my head around a watch you have to charge daily. What exactly does an apple watch do that my phone can't? Don't say fitness things as there are much better and cheaper fitness wearables out there.,Others
1081,Plugging a phone is‚Ä¶ is annoying? What? You‚Äôre not understanding the product at all here. The idea is that it does the same things your phone does so that you don‚Äôt have to have your phone out. You can keep your phone in your pocket. Obviously. If you just want fitness tracking by all means get a tracker that does only that. If you want a product that is a supplement to your phone and allows you to keep your phone out away in social situations while still being on alert then Apple Watch is the choice. It‚Äôs not for everyone. Definitely not for someone who thinks plugging a phone in is annoying. Seriously‚Ä¶ people these days.,Others
1082,One of the most annoying parts of my phone is all of the notifications.  Now I am also getting them on something attached to my wrist?  Sounds like a nightmare.,Others

1086,I subscribed and tried using it for a month. Coming from JEFIT my issue was with how llimited was Strong‚Äôs database of exercises. I also missed JEFIT‚Äôs muscle recovery insights. I did like Strong‚Äôs warm up set calculator but I ended up going back to JEFIT.,Others
1087,I use the free tier - more than enough for what I need.,Others

1089,You seriously need to go to the Apple web site and look at all the info Apple give on using and owning an AW. Also there are lots of reviews on AW on YouTube and other tech review sites. Practically everyone here on this sub would recommend a S7 as it‚Äôs the latest model (this is a sub for AW after all) with the most features but also would recommend the SE too if money is an issue. All AWs and Apple Health app do not prioritise step counting as a primary judge of fitness.,Others

No regrets upgrading",Others
1092,I have the Apple Watch SE and it does the job for workout. I have more than enough info I need for when I work out. Only drawbacks are you get no ECG and always on display. That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt like about mine. Other than that I‚Äôm happy with mine and hasn‚Äôt let me down.,Others

1109,"Honestly aesthetics in the end. First few weeks you'll try have fun messing around with all the feature then you'll just end up not using it for all it has. Only to see notifications if you're walking, your phone is not near you and to check time. Especially if you're in highschool and you're only part time it's really not that useful. And it's yet another thing to charge. You forget to charge it? Can't use it. And then if you really don't go out a lot then it's just gonna sit around eventually. My two cents is you could do a lot more with $190 than get a smart watch. If you want it to track fitness you can get a fitness band for way cheaper it also tells you the time, some even notifications. Then you can use the rest of the money on something else you really want. You want to just tell the time? Get a watch. You'll realise as well that you're just gonna reach for your phone anyway when you get a notification and such. A smart watch is a luxury not a necessity. If you're worried you could spend the money on other stuff especially if you don't have much already, don't buy it and spend it on something more useful to you.",Others
1110,"I‚Äôve mine since christmas, and I‚Äôve drived it daily since then. First months you will mess with the features, than you will start use it in a more practical way, like another user pointed out. But it‚Äôs still pretty useful to answer calls quickly, check the weather or your calendar. Also, it helped me to work out more. Not just a bit, a lot. I‚Äôm now doing some kind of exercise everyday to close the rings and get the achievement.",Others
1111,"I like mine because I had a tendency to walk out and forget my phone. What made me get it was because my dad passed away and my mom was trying to get ahold of me to deliver the news, but I had forgotten my phone at home. I went out that day and purchased an Apple Watch",Others
1112,I held off one because for the longest time I didn‚Äôt care about the fitness stuff. Quiet honestly still don‚Äôt. I got mine for two reasons. First - I‚Äôm a sucker for cool tech stuff. Second - I‚Äôm trying to detach myself from my phone a bit and if that means using my watch to play music while I go on 30 minute dog walks that‚Äôs fine with me.,Others
1113,I have ADHD and it‚Äôs been an absolute game changer for me. Just the use of being able to press a button on it to locate my iPhone was worth the money alone.,Others
1114,"It‚Äôs absolutely worth it!
Even more for $190!",Others
1115,Likely different for me as I'm much older. It encouraged me to get out and about and as a result I lost some weight. I can get notifications at work when I can't have my phone with me and it's also helped me to get better sleep. Frankly had I not had the watch I'd have gone back to Android.,Others
1116,"I was feeling the same way when I was about to get mine, and I decided to go for it in the end. IMO, totally worth it. I thought it would only be useful for when I exercise, but it actually motivates you to improve your lifestyle. It reminds you to breathe, to stand for a while when you have been sitting for too long and it is helpful to control your overall health. Being able to answer calls, see your notifications and reply to texts directly from your wrist when you don't have your phone next to you really comes in handy as well. And tbh $190 is a bargain, so I would definitely get it.",Others
1117,"It‚Äôs been one of the best gifts I have ever gotten.
I got the series 6 and the ekg really made a big different in monitoring my heart sensor.
I wear mine very say and love the compliments I get.
The only issue im having is that it‚Äôs better to upgrade with every new purchase",Others
1118,"Unless you already have an iPhone it would be a huge waste of limited resources. If you do, then research what it can and can't do. If your primary reason is that it looks cool then don't get it.",Others
1119,It‚Äôs helped me a lot mostly for keeping healthy,Others
1120,It‚Äôs a great addition to the phone. I use it throughout the day and I have lost 15 pounds since getting it.,Others
1121,"I use mine as a watch as well as a fitness tracker. I can‚Äôt saw how accurate the tracking is but it lets me know when I‚Äôm being too sedentary and helps me convince my brain to squirt happy juices when I accomplish things. Used it for calls maybe twice and I‚Äôm not a fan but it‚Äôs been a few watchOS versions since I tried so‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt have the cell plan option and really don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs worth it but that‚Äôs just me.",Others
1122,The Apple Watch helped me lose 20kilos and start a habit of being active through the ring closing app in activity. I also track fasts and meditations with it. So yes it‚Äôs definitely a super important product in my life if not the most important. If you don‚Äôt really care about the health features however it‚Äôs a pretty pointless product. The notifications on the wrist are nice but not game changing. I hardly use the calculator and the other apps at all.,Others
1123,"Sounds like you don‚Äôt need it.  I only use the Apple Watch to track my fitness, for text notification, and meeting notification. If you‚Äôre in school 8 hours a day then you‚Äôll definitely have no use for it in that 8 hours.  I think it‚Äôs a waste if you‚Äôre not in an office and use it for exercise daily.",Others
1124,"I had the SE (4G+GPS) for about 5 months then sold it.   


I didn‚Äôt find it to be worthwhile as an everyday watch. Needs too much attention to charging everyday and wasn‚Äôt sufficiently standalone. Not enough customisation of how I want the screen to display info to serve as a day-long tool.  


I did find it to be good as a sports activity tracker, but then again fairly high priced for that segment of devices.

In the end it felt like wasted money sitting around too much, so I sold it to recoup. I might one day pick up a used GPS-only one for when I‚Äôm biking etc, if I find a cheap one. Would not pay full price at current price Structures as the value was just not there for me.",Others
1125,Of course. I couldn‚Äôt live without my Apple Watch because I am a fitness enthusiast. I have the series 6 and trying to decide if I‚Äôm going to get the 7 or wait until the 8 because I‚Äôm looking for more health upgrades,Others
1126,I have seizures occasionally so just the fact it can let me get help sold me on it.,Others
1127,"I like mine, using it all the time to find my phone lol",Others
1128,I love my Apple Watch. My dad bought me a 5 last year. I used it a lot during the pandemic and stopped using it for a few months but I‚Äôve been back to using it everyday. I have a 9 month old so it‚Äôs super easy to not have my phone one me but still able to answer texts. Also I love I can use Apple Pay and not take out my phone.,Others
1129,"It has improved my life a lot. Mainly because of its capability to track the calories you burn and your daily activity. The way I see it is that you can't improve what you can't measure. So, the Apple Watch allows me to improve in this aspect. All the other things are handy, having the calendar readily available, keeping track of the last time I fed my cat, no-screen way of getting GPS directions (and hence, a safer driving experience), and its ability to track my sleep quality are all great extras.",Others

1196,You would have to add the Phillip Hue light to homekit. And then you can control it with the watch by using Siri or the Homekit App.,Others
1197,Because I thought I would but then didn't plus I didn't want to go to a store and get a 4 when I can just get a 5 online with a band of my choosing and get 3% back with my Apple Card. Plus now in the future if I want to use always on I can since I have the option.,Others
1198,Hey no worries. It is holding up great. It‚Äôs never came off while working out when I‚Äôve worked out. My wrists don‚Äôt normally get sweat so I don‚Äôt know how it would hold up. But it still looks like new to me.,Others

1210,My series 6 lasts 2 days and at the end of exactly 2 days since last charge it‚Äôs at about 10% or under and at the end of one full day it‚Äôs at 60% so the series 7 is quite an upgrade in battery life,Others

It drained super fast on my first drain because I spent a lot of time messing with settings but now drain is reasonable even with AOD.",Others

Not earth shattering, but good insight.  Made me feel more in touch with how I felt throughout the day when it was linked to metrics.",Others
1216,"I have a series 3. I definitely don‚Äôt think they should be selling it for that price, but honestly mine is completely fine for tracking my runs, workouts, etc.

I have the cellular version though which much have more storage because I‚Äôve never had to do the factory reset to upgrade, etc.",Others
1217,It‚Äôs also priced to compete with other cheap watches on the market at a similar price range,Others

1219,"Series 3 does fine for activity and sleep tracking, notifications, messages, timers, weather, heart rate, Apple Music, and no-contact bank and credit card functions. It‚Äôs an iPod Nano.",Others
1220,"it‚Äôs still a great no frills fitness tracker that is STILL somehow better than 2021  android wear watches AND fitbits while being cheaper than the both of them

also probably has some good industrial use",Others
1221,"Because most people with an Apple Watch don‚Äôt use any function besides telling time, and checking messages quickly.",Others
1222,"Honestly the price isn‚Äôt even good considering how old and slow it is.

Should‚Äôve been the SE at that price point.",Others
1223,"It‚Äòs used for up-selling.
You see how cheap the series 3 is, and start thinking about getting one.
Later, you visit the website and see the SE is just a little bit more expensive, and get it instead since you are already sold on the idea of getting an apple watch.",Others
1224,They should just give it away for back to school instead of AirPods if they really have too much inventory to clear for s3,Others
1225,"Kid‚Äôs first Apple Watch. Although, stupidly on my behalf, mine got the SE‚Ä¶",Others
1226,"I think it‚Äôs because the Series 3 isn‚Äôt really competing against the other Apple Watches.  It‚Äôs competing against the other fitness watches.  When viewed through that lens, the Series 3 does quite a bit for $199 if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs looking for a fitness tracker.",Others
1227,It‚Äôs a crappy choice to make the other choices look better in comparison. It also is good to compare and contrast with other models,Others
1228,It doesn‚Äôt even make sense bc it‚Äôs not much cheaper than the SE,Others
1229,It‚Äôs pretty slow on watch os 8 too. Watch os 7.5 was great performance even though the battery life wasn‚Äôt as good.,Others
1230,It‚Äôs a viable option for parents to buy an Apple Watch for their child/children without breaking the bank.,Others
1231,Would very much recommend a series 4 if you can snag one on eBay. I just picked up a S4 Cellular to replace my old S4 GPS and it still works wonders. I got my GF an S6 and can‚Äôt say that I feel like I‚Äôm missing much.,Others
1232,It‚Äôs plausible a lot of the people buying them clearly see it‚Äôs an older device but the price works for them.  They probably have realistic expectations and don‚Äôt use it for more then notifications and fitness tracking. Im sure when Apple can get the Se price down they will finally kill it.,Others
1233,"I have a friend who bought a Series 3 last week. She just wanted the fitness tracking and notifications, so it's perfect for her - and it's nearly half the price of the Series 7. So there's definitely an audience for it. 

I however, just upgraded from Series 4 to Series 7 and am loving it! My wife now has my Series 4 - replacing her Series 2 which she was very happy with.",Others

1235,The updates do not have that problem anymore btw.,Others
1236,"I‚Äôve recently sold mine as I upgraded to a S7, but you are making it sound a lot worse than it is.

The Series 3 can still do all the basics of an Apple Watch, and that‚Äôs all some users want.",Others
1237,I think that‚Äôs the whole point. A $500 fitness tracker doesn‚Äôt sit right with people usually. $200 a lot more in line with cheaper fitbits and other fitness trackers,Others
1238,"The cellular model had 16GB of storage whereas the GPS model was 8GB, iirc.",Others
1239,"It also easier to decide to buy a watch at 200 and then decide to spend just a little more for the much better se. 

Pricing strategy",Others
1240,"Honestly I thought the same but knowing that the SE is the standard ""cheaper"" series make me wondering so I looked it up.",Others
1241,And ist maybe also the fact that people who bought it will stick tobapple and invest in a newer and more expensive one. But first thought was literally: apple why,Others
1242,"I like watching tech vids but not tech savvy sometimes. 

Esp not with apple products as an android guy. 

However..... spotted apple watch series 3 on sale black friday for 109 bucks and thought it made a great gift for my folks.

That is a decent price right?",Others
1243,"I have a series 3. I have put off upgrade after upgrade. 

It‚Äôs hardly fine. It‚Äôs slow, chunky, upgrading it is a whole ordeal. The extra for the SE for a new buyer is 100% the way to go. Save them from the misery.",Others
1244,This is fixed with newer updates.,Others
1245,"Idk, my GF has a series 3 and constantly has issues on every update.  As soon as the series 7 hits the family and friends store, I‚Äôm buying her one",Others
1246,"Indeed, Apple worked some kind of magic for watchOS and made it much smoother on the S3. WatchOS 7 was a nightmare for me to install. Ended up keeping my S3 for another cycle, trying to hold out for a redesign.",Others
1247,"I still have a series 3, before that I had a series 0 but so far and for my use I haven‚Äôt felt the need to upgrade at all..yes upgrading is a mess but other than that performance feels fine to me  
I do remember the huge jump from series 0 to 3 though",Others
1248,watchOS 8.0.1 improved the performance drastically. It actually was enough to make me put off buying a series 7.,Others
1249,"Couldn't agree with  you more man. I owned the series 3 about 2 years ago, and when I had it it was starting to slow down and become a headache. I can't imagine it now. I don't think its ethical of apple to be selling such a poor performing device.",Others
1250,"Yeah, mine runs like shit even after countless hard resets/wipes and then re-pairing it to my phone. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt buy a S3 today but I don‚Äôt wear it much so I‚Äôm still waiting to upgrade when they add more health sensors. Maybe next year.",Others
1251,I bought my series 3 shortly after it was released in 2017 and it still works great with no issues. I occasionally want to update but don‚Äôt have enough of a compelling reason to do so. I can even get away with charging it every other day depending on how much I‚Äôm using it.,Others
1252,"Yeah if you just stick to the default Apple apps the series 3 is still very good. I‚Äôve given up using any third party stuff as it‚Äôs so much slower. 

Play/pause/skip is all pretty unresponsive for me in the Overcast app for example but the default music controls are instant.",Others
1253,"I dont know what to tell you, sorry its happening to you but i have a base model which has like 5gb and its working fine for me for a while now.",Others
1254,"Agreed.  I have the 3, 4 and 7.  3 is so fucking slow it's painful to use.",Others
1255,"Yes, watchOS 8 now has incremental updates like iOS.",Others
1256,For a given value of ‚Äúslow‚Äù. I find my older iPads to be painfully slow in comparison to the latest. Someone who has never used one think they are fast.,Others

1286,"I tried the other shorter band, but it's tight even when I use the bottommost hole.",Others
1287,I did make the text a bit larger and that helped. (For some reason making it too large caused eye strain as well.),Others
1288,"Thanks for undertaking this. I'me one of the folks that always thought a smartwatch would eventually be the best detox device for me since I'm not concerned with privacy, but looks like it still has a long ways to go. Not to mention the extra phone plan costs which are a recurring expense.",Others
1289,"No problem, thank you for reading :) 

Yes I think it isn‚Äôt there yet. Perhaps one running a meant-to-be-stand-alone OS (like a skinned Android) with a Bluetooth mini QWERTY keyboard would the issues I‚Äôve highlighted. Sort of like a tiny blackberry with a wrist strap. At that point though I would glue one to the other and make a mini BB. But then you could just get a Jellyphone 2 at that point. 

One other consideration that popped up for me a few times is that it‚Äôs your phone on your wrist. If you are going to a formal event, it really stands out and makes you look like a SpyKid. I think most smartwatches will, the displays look too 2D to fool anyone that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äòreal‚Äô watch (even with Always-On). I guess you could take off the straps and keep it in your pocket, but its so little and slippery it will end up flying into someone‚Äôs wine.",Others
1290,"Funny story, a Jelly 2 is what I actually use now üòÇ now I just have to attach it to my wrist.",Others
1291,"Would love to see a fallout pipboy style wrist holder for the jelly2, I know they have the clunky universal one but the jelly 2 is small enough to really make it work",Others
1292,I have the SE and I‚Äôm loving it so far. It‚Äôs my first time having a smart watch and I‚Äôm loving every second of it,Others
1293,The best buy imo,Others
1294,Looks like an Apple Watch to me.,Others
1295,"I have a 5 and really the only differences that the SE doesn‚Äôt have are the always on and EKG. My wife got an SE, and it‚Äôs a solid AW. Personally, had I known Apple was going to release a less expensive version a year later, I‚Äôd have waited. I‚Äôm still happy with my 5, though.",Others
1296,i am also very happy with my SE - works very well overall,Others
1297,"I love my SE. I would‚Äôve turned off the always-on display anyway, so there‚Äôs really no other reason for me to buy a different watch, especially one that‚Äôs way more expensive.",Others

Love it",Others
1302,My first Apple Watch is this one,Others
1303,"A good Apple Watch for those who are new to Apple Watch. You get almost every features that the Series 4, 5, and 6 has at a very good price. Definitely worth the money.",Others
1304,I accidentally smashed my Series 4 literally 42 days outside of my AppleCare warranty and ended up buying an SE to replace it with. It‚Äôs like 99% of the features for 70% of the price. Hard to go wrong in terms of value.,Others
1305,Bought for me and my wife two SE (40mm and 44mm). We are so happy about them.,Others
1306,"I‚Äôm very happy, I moved from Fitbit and have no regrets.",Others
1307,Love it. Avoided Apple watch for a long time due to battery life concerns but my SE lasts 2 days and i simply love it  can turn on the lights with it. Make calls (within range etc). Just brilliant,Others
1308,Bought it over the 5 because I don't need all the two extra features the 5 has.,Others
1309,"I love the SE. I can say it‚Äôs even better than the 6 because of Cost and that it has more storage than the S3, so it‚Äôs a win for me. Plus I use it all the time when I‚Äôm listenin to Music, so I don‚Äôt have to rewind a song from my phone when I can do it on my wrist. And let‚Äôs not forget the Fitness. Major plus for me. I‚Äôve been a Apple Watch owner for over a year now, movin from the S3 to the SE and I‚Äôm glad I decided to get it, because this watch is a Game Changer!",Others
1310,"The lack of always on display is a no no for me, I would rather get a used series 5 (Have had mine for over a year) but at this point just wait for the next to come out. Amazing value though",Others
1311,"I think that's the best Apple Watch made to date, because how many first Watch users can buy a great device with much lower price (especially in more poor countries where it makes really significant difference). Great business decision and execution. Win for users and for Apple.",Others
1312,Upgraded from series 3 to SE back a few months ago and I love it,Others
1313,"It‚Äôs a good option but only in the US. It‚Äôs still too expensive everywhere else. I got a slightly used 44mm cellular S5 which had 99% of the battery health still remaining for much cheaper, and they have almost the same hardware!",Others
1314,I love it,Others
1315,I loved mine. Had it for a couple weeks then it broke (Apple replaced it for free) but I need an Apple Watch so I upgraded to the series 6. It‚Äôs a great buy. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about it was no always on display.,Others
1316,"The SE is my first Apple Watch, bought it in March. I love it, though sometimes I wish I‚Äôd gotten the cellular version.",Others
1317,"I upgraded from a launch model to an SE back in February, and I‚Äôve been super happy with the upgrade. It‚Äôs honestly a night and day difference.

I went from barely using it for anything other than checking the time or notifications to constantly using siri and actually using different apps on it.",Others
1318,"I am considering getting one. It would be my first Apple Watch, if ever, and I am thrilled to read the positive comments in this post!",Others
1319,Went from S3 to the SE over the S6 and don‚Äôt regret it. Maybe should have waited since the S7 will have flat sides but overall the SE was a no brainer.,Others

1322,I‚Äôve had my SE for about six weeks now. It‚Äôs my first ever smart watch and I love it.,Others

1329,Got one two weeks ago. I‚Äôm addicted now.,Others
1330,"It‚Äôs my first Apple Watch, bought it February and synced to either my personal or work iPhones it is phenomenal. I don‚Äôt have a wide wrist so the 40mm works and looks well on me; I love my SE!",Others
1331,"It is the watch that people should buy. I love my Series 6 and it is the right choice for me, but the SE is just a great value for a smart watch.",Others
1332,I have a series 4 and got my fianc√© a SE for Christmas. Best bang for the buck AW.,Others
1333,"Aluminum one is really nice, I love how it looks!",Others
1334,"Amazing imo. Been using mine for the last couple of months and it‚Äôs been amazing so far. First Apple Watch I‚Äôve bought and even seen (they‚Äôre not as popular where I live‚Ä¶ small town in Chile) so I can‚Äôt really compare, but it‚Äôs all I thought it was and more.",Others
1335,For the price difference I saved up for the series 6 so I could have the always on display. Given it‚Äôs gonna be an investment for me I decided to save a little longer to get it. Now I‚Äôm waiting for the series 7 to come out hopefully in September lol,Others
1336,I‚Äôve been using my series 1 for 5 years and I can‚Äôt believe I wanted so much to change it,Others

1338,I love my SE. Well this is my second one after Apple replaced my first purchase,Others

1342,I just got mine today! I love it so much,Others
1343,"I just traded in my Apple Watch 3 for an SE. I went with the bigger size, and cellular model, and both of those were huge improvements. I love it. It also feels much snappier than the 3.",Others
1344,"As someone who doesn't give a damn about EKG and AOD, the SE was perfect for me. Then again, I use Voiceover with screen curtain enabled. Helps me get almost 50 hours out of this thing. Only thing I wish it had was 5 GHz WiFi.",Others
1345,"It‚Äôs great, I love mine. I hope they have SE2 by the time mine breaks.",Others
1346,I have one :),Others
1347,"Certainly not exactly a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù watch, but for what it offers, it‚Äôs a rather decent deal. Pretty happy with my AW SE",Others
1348,I went for series 6 which is the most feature rich version but the SE is fine for younger people,Others
1349,I love my Apple Watch SE it's a fantastic product for its price.,Others
1350,Love it.,Others
1351,"How does the SE compare to the 3 practically speaking? I can read specs, but I‚Äôd like to know how it plays out in practice. I‚Äôve had a 3 for about a year now, and it gets bogged down a lot. I don‚Äôt even have a lot on it. Just playing music and Nike Run Club at the same time can cause crashes.",Others
1352,In love with mine. Nike SE from now on,Others
1353,I love it and well worth the price.,Others
1354,"The SE has served me brilliantly! Best value for money by far. In fact, I have the same band as yours too! Which has also served me brilliantly in cooperation with the cream sports loop! Though mine is a 44mm cellular instead of 40mm regular. Hope you enjoy yours!",Others

1361,Anybody have any photos of different bracelets with the standard grey SE?,Others
1362,I love my SE! Great investment.,Others
1363,"I decided to go with the SE as well, as I won't use Always-On (my girlfriend turned hers off to save battery and improve privacy) and am not in need of the health features of the Series 6. Also, my choice of style (color and metal) is the same on the SE and Series 6, so although I could just as well have bought a Series 6, I couldn't see any reason to not just take the SE, as the things I need is identical.",Others
1364,"I‚Äôm loving it. No need spending twice the price for sensors I‚Äôm not gonna use. I do miss the AOD a little bit, but definitely not enough to justify the price of an S6",Others
1365,"I bought an S3 back in 2019 to see if I would fit with an Apple Watch and really took to it, then I got the SE when it came out, mostly for the bigger display as I didn‚Äôt feel I‚Äôd miss any of the other features and it‚Äôs been incredible. I passed the S3 on to my wife and she loves it.",Others
1366,DONT TAKE IT SWIMMING!!! MINE DIED!!,Others
1367,A really good upgrade from the series 3 in terms of speed and screen size,Others
1368,"Upgraded from a ¬£60 fitbit and WOW I‚Äôm impressed. I had the fitbit inspire (without heart rate) before, but I made the decision to buy the SE a year and a half after I got it. The fitbit was basically a pedometer that can tell the time, and the AW is what a smartwatch should be. The features I liked best after upgrading were: colours & custom face, apps, Apple health stats, and the way it syncs so easily with my phone without having to open up the AW app. Really impressed with it so far and glad I got it over the S3 and S6",Others
1369,My first Apple Watch and I love it.,Others
1370,"I bought the S5 after the S3 got broken before the launch of s6 
The screen always on function is a huge battery drainer so i never used it",Others
1371,Honestly the Apple Watch SE is the like best Apple Watch you can get right now apart from the Apple Watch Series 6 it‚Äôs a really good watch recommended I own it I‚Äôve owned it since 2 July and it has been the best watch watch,Others
1372,I think the se is really Gud even now that they have the ecg on it,Others

1382,I like the bang for buck you get with the SE but I had to get a always ON display & yes I know it‚Äôs NOT worth the extra money.,Others
1383,just got it  from black friday and love it!!!  need to watch videos on it tho on youtube to get use to and how to make the watch more usefull but love it!,Others
1384,Absolutely the same feeling here,Others
1385,Everything since the 4 looks the same. Mind you after owning a 4 for nearly 4 years I am happy that it still looks modern apart from the scratches,Others
1386,"The SE is very nice. If I was upgrading this year, that‚Äôs what I would have gone with. However, I upgraded last year from an S1 to S5 and absolutely love the always on display. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to a watch that doesn‚Äôt have it. The EKG I could very easily go without, it‚Äôs neat and I guess nice to know everything‚Äôs fine but it wouldn‚Äôt be something that I wanted to hang onto like the always on display is.",Others
1387,"exactly I got an SE too, but from where I am, the SE is  actually 70$ expensive than the Series 6 in U.S. due to the taxes and stuff.  Sk basically if I was in U.S. this money would have gotten me S6 but I lobe my SE anyway :)",Others
1388,"or AOD, but same thing still applies",Others
1389,Yeah your statement is true. AOD drains battery . IMO I think Apple will discontinue the S3 this year and bring the SE‚Äôs price down even more . The SE is what the Apple Watch was meant to be . Instead of paying an overpriced $399,Battery
1390,"What do you like better about the SE vs 3? I‚Äôm trying to decide which to get, not sure if the SE is worth 35% more in price?",Others
1391,I don‚Äôt get why many people want this feature anyway? You could just raise your wrist and the screen will instantly turn on. Not to mention AOD takes up lots of battery!,Others
1392,The always on display is annoying as hell in a movie theater and can get you kicked out if you don‚Äôt turn it off.,Others

1400,The Deep Navy Sports Loop!,Others
1401,I have the GPS only version. Bought it last October because I was on a prepaid phone plan which doesn't allow any extra devices. I just switched to postpaid so I'll be looking to get the cellular version here soon. I'll definitely be sticking with the SE though. No reason to pay extra for features that I'm not interested in and the SE is a great price for what it offers.,Others

Apple Pay doesn‚Äôt seem that useful when you always have an iPhone in pocket. The only interesting feature is MacBook unlock, but it‚Äôs kinda security hole in many scenarios for me and ecosystem only. Apps are mostly useless, just like terrible realisation of telegram app. So you see my point I hope.",Others
1417,"And one more thing, look at price gap between mi band and Watch SE. That is a big one. Especially when you consider those devices as pretty similar. Yet, price gap between SE and 6-7 is much lesser, but you are having whole Apple Watch experience with a lot of health features and so on. That‚Äôs a personal opinion of course, but my thoughts about this is when you spend a couple of hundred bucks, pay a bit more and have a lot more. If not, just go with cheaper similar thing which even lives longer.",Others
1418,"for me on a budget, I‚Äôd happily miss those things out for an SE and a unspent hundred bucks. If I had more money I‚Äôd definitely go for the s6 for the AOD and stainless steel option",Others

The new Midnight color is also black, which I prefer over the space gray. IMO it's worth it to get the better technology, but it's not that different from the 6, so if you want to save $100 go for the 6, or even the SE if you don't need the sensors.",Others

Definitely don‚Äôt get the series 3 either way, that‚Äôs way too old now, but you could pick up a pretty good condition series 5 or 6 used (or even new in box).

But if you didn‚Äôt like the watch before, I‚Äôm not sure what you would be getting out of it a second time around.",Others
1440,"Think back to why you sold your Series 3.  What were you using the Apple Watch for?

I personally believe the Series 7 is a fantastic Apple Watch but the price tag is out of my reach.  I was also looking at the SE, which I ended up getting to replace my Series 3, and what sold me on that was expandability.

Sure, you can buy a new 42mm Series 3 for $200 or less.  With the way Apple's software updates have been going, they are making it difficult to update the Series 3 to a new watchOS because of the limited amount of space on the watch.  The Series 6, Series 7, and SE all have 32GB of space while the Series 3 only has 8GB.  Come OS update time you're possibly looking at having to delete stuff off the Series 3 watch, unpairing, pairing, and updating.  Pain in the ass.",Others
1441,Well I would have to disagree with some of the comments here I went from a series 5 to a series 7 with cellular on the new seven series and the screen size makes a huge difference in particular for a 40 year old man who is struggling with seeing things up close. The fast charging is brilliantly better than on my series 5 I could not be happier with my purchase and the upgrade from 5 to 7,Others
1442,I just upgraded from a aw5 to a 7. My husband got it for me as a Xmas Present. Only reason I upgraded was because the 40mm screen was ro small for me. I don‚Äôt have the best eyes and it was super hard to read notifications. Now with 45mm 7 I have no problem! I also love the keyboard I use it to text a lot.,Others
1443,"S3 to S7 was worth it just for the extra watch faces alone, but the bigger screen size is a nice bonus. S4 already had some of the better faces so you may be alright if it isn‚Äôt that important to you.",Others

Is Garmin‚Äôs data even accurate or are the numbers on their Watch just fluff? Like body battery, heart rate, or any metric it measures? Then again, how accurate is apples in a lab setting? We are all wearing these devices to get these data points but can the data gathered actually stand up to lab tests?

Small update but I just got the watch, think it was 70% charged when turning it on. Have done couple hour long workouts and never plugged in and still at 12 days of battery. Apple get on this level.",Battery
1612,I really like having Body Battery and find that it is a very useful training tool. I check my morning HRV using other apps already but I‚Äôve noticed certain behaviors which reduce HRV and sap my battery. I also use Stryd for running and train by power rather than pace. The major benefit of the F√©nix over the Apple Watch for me is the battery life and sleep metrics.,Battery
1613,"I would add my two cents in for others looking to switch, the experience for notifications changes quite a bit from Android and iOS",Others

1616,Having to charge the AW every night or every other night is a deal breaker for me. They could add all the features in the world but if I don't get the same battery as a Garmin it pointless to me.

1617,"I‚Äôm literally doing the same comparison right now. I just worth the fenix 5 for a week last week and I‚Äôm wearing my Apple Watch this week to compare. My 2 biggest takeaways so far are battery life difference, obviously. And being able to do a quick text back is very nice on the Apple Watch. I‚Äôm just not sure I can deal with charging my AW daily compared to getting 7 days on the garmin.",Others
1618,"Thanks for all of this insight.  Currently on an AW4, it currently serves my needs but whenever the Fenix 7 comes out I will consider making the change.  The ability to use it as a cycling headunit, golf gps, as well as battery for long hikes and runs all appeals to me as I won't need to worry about charging for weekend trips.      

I feel like I may miss the ease of use of responding to texts etc on my watch... but hopefully after a while I will forget I even had that option.",Battery

1623,"For me, the body battery metric on the latest firmware is absolutely spot on. I‚Äôm really impressed with it as a metric - though I don‚Äôt necessarily use the information as a tool. It simply validates the way I‚Äôm feeling (which I suppose is a form of bias). 

Same with the sleep metrics.",Battery
1624,"I find measurements from AW and Fenix pretty similar, including calories, VO2max, HR max, HRrest and so on. There are differences, but these are couple % differences.

I guess that number of people who really care about this kind of measurements is preety small (and they all use proper sport watches), the majority of people is just fine with closing rings and Training Status is something that would mostly de-motivate them ;)

I'd love to see Apple Watch Garmin Edition instead of Nike edition - that would be best watch ever.",Others
1625,"Just the response I was looking for. The AW touchscreen blows for running. In the summer, my sweaty paws can't swipe.

For me the biggest issue is the API on the weather which is nearest weather station (fortunately mine is only 8miles away), rather than doing it via direct location and using a source like Weather Channel etc. But if your nearest one was 100miles or so away (which some people have) it wouldn't be of much asssistance.",Others
1636,Fenix 5 owner here. I have the same GPS issues and it drives me crazy at times. Otherwise I love the watch.,Others
1637,"Thank you.

Same error is obviously good enough if you train for yourself (like I do), but getting consistent readout is also a hard thing: GPS signal strength varies if there are dense clouds, so on that days you might get different distance (and pace as a consequence). Autumn comes where I live, trees are starting to loose leaves so I expect I'll get better distance and pace (on the same route) :)",Others

I'd imagine that, as technology does, it's gotten cheaper and more accurate in the last decade. The question is whether it's cheap enough for a device like the Apple Watch, and accurate enough to replace finger-prick testing.

It would be a hugely disruptive tech to include if it satisfies both of those requirements.  There's *big* money being made exploiting the testing needs of diabetics.  I wouldn't doubt there's some part of that industry doing whatever they can to stall or prevent something like this coming to market.",Others

1705,"I mean, the lack of info on progress of the tech in the past ten years might also be an indication it‚Äôs not advancing and getting better or cheaper. 

Trust me, there‚Äôs no conspiracy. The first to do glucose monitoring without a prick of any kind is going to make a killing. They all currently require a device to be imbedded in your skin at the moment and frequent maintenance. 

As for current glucose monitoring, using a CGM with a smartphone is a nightmare as the FDA has to approve each version of the device‚Äôs app. This often means you can‚Äôt update your OS or risk your monitor no longer working.

Assuming you‚Äôre at least taking your phone camping with you? And that you might be bringing some from of power to keep that charged? I‚Äôd just really like to see apple simplify the way the watch charges, something Qi based, something that lets the watch charge via the iphone? I dono. 

I totally hear how annoying the watch is to charge when traveling, but when you‚Äôre not traveling I‚Äôm always gonna charge it daily, its just simpler to have a routine like that,  once you have a routine around charging your devices they‚Äôre just never out of battery and you never even have to worry about it.",Others

1711,"Good points.  I agree that they couldn't get away with the ""non-medical"" distinction that they do for the blood-oxygen sensor. Some folks would be using that glucose data to determine things like insulin dosage.  That's not something you want to mess around with.

I would assume that they'd need to deal with any sort of glucose monitoring function in roughly the same way the EKG function (which IIRC also required FDA approval) is managed. I'm not sure of the particular details of what's required for that, but I'd guess it's similar to other medical devices.",Others

I put it on in the morning before going to the gym and the only time I take it off before I go to bed at night is when I take a shower. I like the Siri functionality especially with my AirPods Pro in. It also works really well when I take a walk at night time and leave my phone on the couch. I can listen to music and still answer calls, texts and emails from the watch. I do, however, wish that Apple would focus on the Home app on the watch when not connected to WiFi or connected to your phone via Bluetooth.

I don‚Äôt use Siri at all, for anything and have literally never paired headphones to mine.  

Also ... I have an iPad.  I don‚Äôt use it.   At all.  Ever.  I know some people love them.  

Truth is we have a lot of overlapping tech and which pieces are most useful depends on you.   The parts of the watch that are really specific are the all day calorie/health stat tracking.

Not finding a device useful for you, fair ‚Äònuff. I love my iPad, but I can see why it just wouldn‚Äôt fit into some people‚Äôs needs.

But you perceive a difference between whether the iPad offers anything to you in particular, and whether it‚Äôs bad at what it does offer and what it‚Äôs supposed to be. Those are two different questions.

1962,">So the App uses an API token and goes direct to Tesla... but still I guess if the app can control the car, its open in some way

Its not the app on the watch controling your car.. that is not possible because everything needs to go through tesla servers and be verified with tokens etc. Basically what the app does is imitate the original tesla app by issuing the same commands and using its token. If it is open source and it can be seen that the tokens are stored on your device not on some db hosted with the developer then it is safe as it works exactly like the original. But as you said those token gives access to your car and anyone sharing them needs to be cautious about it.",Others

First is to make the requests directly to Teslas servers from an application, second would be to set up a self-hosted server that facilitates interaction with Tesla‚Äôs servers and no third party. 

Either way you‚Äôre typing your credentials into an ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù app, they‚Äôre just never going anywhere but to either yourself, or Tesla.

I haven‚Äôt looked into how Tesla handles authentication, but I doubt they have an Oauth system.",Others
1966,"I'm not suggesting it can be ""stolen"" because it doesn't need to be, it's already been given freely to the app.

Once you have the token, the app can harvest data it wants, and can send whatever command it wants. The developer can do anything the token has access to do.",Others

After having it for two weeks, I'd say I wish I had gotten the SE when it came out last year instead of waiting all this time for the 7. Blood oxygen sensor and ECG are total gimmicks, so unless you have a legitimate cardiovascular health concern, I'd save a few dollars and go with the SE. Fast charging and the big screen are nice, but I don't think it justifies the increase in price. Also the keyboard is a bitch to actually use. Go with the SE, I think you'll like it.",Others
2198,"I had the SE before, I didn‚Äôt upgrade but it‚Äôs a long story and now i have the S7, let me tell you that I wouldn‚Äôt really have upgraded, now the S7 is soooo nice, big screen, faster charging, keyboard, always on display and more health sensors, i would say if you don‚Äôt care about always on display, the screen difference isn‚Äôt something that you would notice, it is something that you get used to, if you got the SE believe me the bigger bezels aren‚Äôt that noticeable, and the faster charging is nice, but if you have time before sleep that you don‚Äôt need your watch the SE is good enough, the health sensors, well it depends you know more about yourself of course, hopefully I didn‚Äôt miss a lot, i would say that you won‚Äôt regret both, if you have any questions don‚Äôt be bothered to ask me üëç",Others

Don‚Äôt think the ECG would actually work for you if you go by your real age. There‚Äôs a age requirement to use the feature.",Others

Another option that I‚Äôd highly recommend is to check third party retailers like Best Buy and Target, I saw the Series 6 for $250 on Best Buy one day which is an insane deal considering you aren‚Äôt missing out much from the 7",Others
2201,I don‚Äôt use the O2 sensor nor the ECG and still bought the series 7. The bigger screen is gorgeous and I like the new colours (starlight). I‚Äôm 28 and have a good job tho so thankfully for me the price gap between the SE and the Series 7 wasn‚Äôt a decisive factor. If you‚Äôre tight on money go for the SE. You‚Äôll love it,Others

2210,"Thank you for the in depth answer, just wondering did the upgrade overall feel worth it?",Others
2211,"Oh I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks, however I think I am mainly focused on other factors such as the screen size and always on mode.",Others
2212,"That‚Äôs good to hear as screen size is a key factor I‚Äôm thinking about, thanks for the info!",Others
2213,"Haha, I‚Äôm actually paying for half of it.",Others
2214,"It‚Äôs really not. My friend has an SE, upgraded from Series 3 and he is super content! But I respect your opinion",Others
2215,"I am wearing one right now, and I can confirm that it is in fact not literal shit.",Others
2216,"I would say if you‚Äôre not used to wearing a watch, the AOD is nice to have but not essential at all, and the SE is an excellent choice. I was quite happy with my S3 when I had it. But I‚Äôve got used to having always-on now, and I‚Äôd absolutely miss it if I went back to a watch without it.",Others
2217,"Nope, you would barely notice it.",Others
2218,"Like i said I didn‚Äôt upgrade, sold the SE in july and bought this now, but I remember the SE and the exact experience, i can tell you the S7 is worth it if you can afford it without thinking twice about the money, and as a first watch yes, but for you like you said you don‚Äôt use your watch often, i would say the most important deciding factor for you is if you care about always on display or not.",Others
2219,Then those will be the only other two benefits you will gain from 7 to SE. aluminum on 7 has more color options so there‚Äôs there‚Äôs a minor consideration. Then there‚Äôs the faster charging option for the 7.,Others
2220,I don‚Äôt really want to drop 400 dollars on a Series 7 since I can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt need to use most of it‚Äôs features like ECG or blood oxygen. I want to get the Nike since it has more features without additional costs,Others
2221,Not really. I‚Äôm still learning how the thing works to be honest. I don‚Äôt think the o2 reader or the ecg are worth the additional cost for my context.,Others
2222,"I think this is the most sensible answer in this thread. The Always On Display is the killer feature as it means you don‚Äôt have to raise your wrist to tell the time or to see if it‚Äôs a notification that‚Äôs worth stopping and raising your wrist for. More importantly, some apps, like Workouts continue to display metrics when your wrist is lowered eg let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre riding a bike or running, glancing at your wrist while it‚Äôs down let‚Äôs you still see the data. On an SE the screen is off so you need to raise to see the info. 

If this feature matters to you, then look into Series 6. 

If it doesn‚Äôt matter then SE.",Others
2223,"Oh, that‚Äôs a shame, thank you though.",Others
2224,"Yes that is true, I think right now I‚Äôm focused on how important I find those factors as there aren‚Äôt too many reasons to go for 7.",Others
2225,That‚Äôs quite true and I probably won‚Äôt be needing it. I guess the main factors I‚Äôm concerned about are the screen size and always on mode.,Others
2226,"Ah okay, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll be thinking about, thanks.",Others
2227,Also the 7 has a slightly better chip. May not seem like much but I imagine future OS updates in the years down from now it would help. It also has U1 which SE doesn‚Äôt have. All may seem minor but just some specs to consider about.,Others
2228,"Actually, you get a bunch of exclusive Nike watch faces as well that are not available to be downloaded elsewhere.",Others
2229,"I guess different folks will feel differently about that. I know the 7 has more screen but using the se it doesn‚Äôt feel dated or that the screen is small for me. The idea of always on mode is nice n all but I don‚Äôt know why I would need my watch screen on when I‚Äôm not looking at it, the rise to look thing on the se when I tilt my wrist works really well and brings the screen on. If I had the 7 I think I would disable aod. We all have different use cases though so that might be very different to yours.",Others
2230,No problem. Generally speaking every Apple Watch is good for 3 years before really big new features are added (I‚Äôve owned them since Series 0). Series 6 is from 2020 so you‚Äôre good till about Series 9 in 2023. Series 6 has exactly the same internals as a Series 7 minus fast charging.,Others
2231,"There seems to be. I visited the website u/DIL3MMA mentioned and Target will roll out a deal for the SE in both sizes, the 40mm being $219. Big shoutout my guy, thanks!

I was unsure but I can‚Äôt really justify $180 more for the s7 as I‚Äôm really just using this as a workout device and notification checker.",Others
2232,"That‚Äôs a good point, thanks.",Others
2233,And you get to choose the Nike bands at first purchase which I think are better (especially the sport loop),Others
2234,The S7 screen is nice but it definitely hasn‚Äôt made the S4-S6/SE design/screens feel immediately dated the way the S4 did to the S0-S3.,Others

2236,"How long until a slightly modified version is released as the OnePlus Watch?

If this would run the 4100 platform, it would be an instant buy for me. At 249‚Ç¨, I'll just wait for the first 4100 watches. The next Fossil most likely won't have it, but they might a revision later on that has 4100.",Others

2245,"Even though I am an Apple Watch user, its really good to see finally a worthy competitor from the Android (Wear OS) space. I am only concerned about its battery life because my Apple Watch easily gets through a day and still has around 40-45% charge left. If Oppo watch is able to get through a day easily, then I feel it‚Äôs a total bang for buck. I would easily recommend it to a lot of my friends who are on Android.",Others

2256,I'm looking for a replacement just frustrated that it won't be released until October in the UK,Others
2257,Michael talks about in the video how its really more about getting 1gb+ of RAM rather than a new chipset. An extra co-processor and smaller chip fab won't help you much if you still only have 512mb or 756mb of RAM.,Others

I agree for the packaging, OK, but really not for the design of the watch. I think the Oppo is much much better than the AW design wise.",Others

And Samsung Active 2 can go for 3 days with AOD.",Battery
2290,"Yes. Ofc I do know that. But in terms of the smoothness of the OS, notifications swooping in at the right time, the haptic feedback on AW( this is just too big of a deal to me now- can‚Äôt go back ever) and other such small things made me just love AW more than these watches. WearOS tbh has a lot of potential in my eyes. Its just that Google hasn‚Äôt taken it seriously and realised its true potential. 
Samsung Active is more of a fitness watch rather than a true smartwatch. Yes I will agree it does all the things but the Tizen OS part just doesn‚Äôt have my attention. It infact repels me tbh given everything I have heard about it in terms of the poor app support on it.",Others
2291,"I have actually ordered from Amazon UK before, so maybe there are just restrictions on certain items? Or maybe it's more limited now due to the pandemic?",Others
2292,Interesting.... Guess I'll just sit back and see how it plays out then.,Others
2293,"This watch looks a lot like the Apple Watch and it's pretty clear to me that that was what they were aiming for too. There are a few details that are different as you point out, but everything else is as close of a direct copy they could reasonably get away with.",Others
2294,I used a WearOS watch. I haven‚Äôt used Samsung Active but one of my friends had it and he wasn‚Äôt quite satisfied with the app ecosystem. I don‚Äôt know what apps were missing but I just know that much.,Others

For Samsung watches, it's better to have a Samsung phone. And then there is nothing to regreat from the Apple Watch.",Others
2298,Thanks man!!  I'll do the same,Others
2299,"No. There are very clear differences between most of the round watches that make them clearly distinct designs. This Oppo watch is so heavily ""inspired"" by the Apple Watch design that arguing otherwise becomes ridiculous.",Others

2301,"Like what, the dials or buttons on the side? Like how apple has a dial and oppo has a button?  I get that they look alike... But to act like it's some big deal they are shaped the same is a bit ridiculous.  Look at the fossil 5 and Movado watch, they look identical.  Now, does it need to be an oval?  Have two buttons instead of 3?  The point is the total package, not just a shape.  So yeah, the outer design is inspired, or imitated.  Who gives a shit.",Others
2302,"Well not really. This is one of the finest smartwatches available, but the ecosystem is too closed, the battery life is not so good, there are practically no watchfaces to choose from (whitch is a complete dealbreaker for me) AOD is not good, armbands are proprietary and it's quite overpriced IMHO.",Others

2304,Well that‚Äôs basically Apple to be precise. They are known for being notorious for exercising control everywhere possible. AOD is ok for me at least. Cannot say about other‚Äôs experience though but I am fine with it. Same goes for the battery life. And obviously Apple being Apple they will keep their bands proprietary. Hell they haven‚Äôt phased out lightning ports on iPhone till now. Price wise - yes it‚Äôs overpriced. But then this is Apple. It‚Äôs not like I am trying to defend them here. But that‚Äôs how they have always been. They are just too focused on their revenues and they know that people are willing to shell out money (at least for now). So why not cash in on that opportunity. Every Apple product just seems overpriced tbh. But they are willing to keep it that way as long as people are paying.,Others
2305,Thanks! Do you know if it matters if we order from Germany vs the UK?,Others
2306,"I wouldn't summarize it better than you do.

The fact is when you compare with a Samsung Watch active 2 AND if you have a Samsung phone, the Active 2 seems a lot better in quite some aspects.

When you compare with a Fossil gen 5 ... no, please don't do it üòÖüòÇü§£üòÇ.

Apple devices are overpriced but you still can sell it for a good price. Other brands loose most of their value as soon as you open the box. So the price difference is not so bog that it looks.",Others

2311,"A lot of younger reviewers seem to miss the point that an always on display finally makes the Apple Watch function like a real watch.

I can't imagine someone switching from a physical watch for example to think AOD is not helpful.",Others

2334,"AOD is cool, but just as cellular was a major battery drain on the S3, so it was better to wait for the S4, I think this first iteration is worth skipping unless you upgrade every year.
No matter the refresh rate, it's still powering many LEDs all day.",Others
2335,The first few days my battery was pretty meh.  Nothing better than my s3.  As of now I think the battery has stabilized. Currently at 68%  and it‚Äôs been 10 hours since I left my house.,Battery

I‚Äôm at 34% right now after 14 hours",Battery
2338,From the S3 it‚Äôs definitely worth an upgrade.,Others
2339,"Yeah, if I had a S4 there was no way I would have considered a S5.  That being said, going from a dirty S1, I appreciate the extra storage (did not get LTE) and the AOD.",Others
2340,I‚Äôm glad to have picked up a S4 now that it got cheaper. Hopefully S6 will be a noticeable upgrade next year.,Others
2341,"Something on macrumors had it saying people were complaining about battery life, so I think Apple is probably aware.",Others
2342,I‚Äôm at 15 hours off the charger right now with always on enabled and I‚Äôm also at 50%,Battery
2343,Do you have raise to wake on? With the always on display I turned that feature off and have found battery life to be much better that way. It‚Äôs also helpful to use less complications on the face you use wherever possible.,Battery
2344,I got my S5 on launch and I‚Äôve been using Overcast without any issues. No watch before that so I can‚Äôt speak to previous models. watchOS 6.0.1.,Others
2345,"That's exactly why the always-on display isn't important to me. There are clocks everywhere, and in the few instances there isn't a clock around, I have to raise my wrist to see my watch anyway, so it defeats the purpose.",Others
2346,Well there wouldn‚Äôt be any real difference in usage. The display on s5 goes down to one refresh per second(which could technically handle a ticking second hand). But while using the watch it goes back to its native refresh which is what gives it that smooth animation.,Others
2347,Agree with this!,Others
2348,"Battery life depends heavily on how you use the watch. If I only use my S3 as a watch, I can get well into a third day. If I work out, listen to music, etc, I usually have to charge it every other day. or even overnight.",Battery
2349,"Yup, now at 14% at 21:20, been on since 06:00 and done a 15min workout. 

Looking forward to the S5 though, should last another 5 years at least.",Others
2350,Do u want AOD? If not then 4. If u want to shell out the extra cash and want AOD then s5.,Others
2351,"For <$200 I think I'd go with the S5. AOD (which you can always turn off it it's too much of a detriment), larger battery and a newer (read: new) product that will most likely be supported for slightly longer.",Others

2355,"I have aluminum, what‚Äôs the allure to ceramic? Just aesthetic?",Others
2356,"I mean clearly if you can afford a ceramic watch the question of ""is the upgrade worth it"" doesn't really apply to you. I think they were saying it's not worth the upgrade for people on a budget",Others
2357,"I second this. I also changed from series 4 gold SS to series 5 ceramic. If ceramic had been available in series 4, I would have gotten one. Always on display (AOD) was one of the major reasons I upgraded since I really wanted my AW behaves as a normal watch. The second reason was ceramic. I love the color and the most scratch resistance material.",Others
2358,Theatre Mode will disable Always On. I use this at night.,Others
2359,My theory is the S4 was supposed to do AOD but the display unevenness at low brightness meant they pulled the feature.,Others
2360,Upgrading from S3 or older? Get the S5. Already have the S4? Hold.,Others
2361,As a series 2 owner I am not disappointed at all - maybe I could have got an S4 but this watch is such an upgrade I have no buyers remorse. The AOD is nicer than I was expecting but the upgrade between the S2 and S5 is massive,Others
2362,"I was coming from S3 and was dead set on the series 5, but after it didn't have sleep tracking and didn't even have a new processor, I just got a used 4 for half the price",Others
2363,"It was also a great upgrade from the series 3!  Screen size alone made it worth it, but the always on is nice to have for workouts for sure.",Others
2364,I have S5 and I can tell you first Hand there‚Äôs hardly a difference in battery life having the display on or off. Maybe 20-30 mins at most.,Others
2365,"If you don‚Äôt need AOD, then the S4 would definitely be sufficient. The S5‚Äôs main upgrades are the AOD, built in compass, and 32gb storage (vs 16). Everything else is essentially the same, including processor speed. If you could find it for significantly cheaper than than the S5, I highly recommend it.",Others

2371,"You are totally right. My friend uses his watch more than a simple watch. Notifications, reading email, workout tracking during daily comute so the 3-4 days he gets are impressive. I get 2 days from my Gear S3 so S4 battery life is way better.",Others
2372,"Same, my battery performs very poor. S4 would be also a good choice since almost identical as S5 and it‚Äôs cheaper",Battery
2373,"That‚Äôs what my biggest gripe was, I loved my S2 but it gradually became slower. This happens over time so it‚Äôs not as noticeable but every now and then it would just bog down and I would just become frustrated.",Others
2374,Serious question: what's the point of the titanium version if it's the easiest to scratch? Pictures online make it look almost identical in appearance to the aluminum cases.,Others
2375,"I have the standard Titanium model and no scratches at all, that being said I‚Äôm also a cautious person but have bumped it a few times and dreaded looking at it because of everything I‚Äôve heard. No scratches still.

It‚Äôs funny, people say that the standard Titanium model is the easiest to scratch yet my S2SS has micro abrasions out the wazoo even after a few days of ownership. My Titanium still looks like it just came out of the box.",Others
2376,"On my S2 there was always a notable loading time before I could do anything, like opening/using apps and using Siri. On the S5 everything happens almost instantly, so I actually started doing a lot of smaller things, like setting reminders, on my watch instead of picking up my phone. My S2 was mostly used for Activity Tracking and telling the time.",Others
2377,"Love the color and it's nearly impossible to scratch, plus it has the sapphire screen.",Others
2378,"I had very specific criteria for it being ""worth it."" Just because because I can afford doesn't mean I'm automatically going to buy it.",Others
2379,Yeah it does and I use it at night too but if your sleeve covers the watch it should turn it off anyway. No reason to switch theater mode on and off because it wastes battery in your sleeve,Others

2386,Yeah it seems like the S5 is probably what they were shooting for when they started designing the S4 but then had to pull back on features due to time and cost constraints. I‚Äôm personally hoping the S6 is a nice leap from the S4/5 but given the lack of competition in the smart watch space not sure we will see much improvement.,Others
2387,"Yeah, I definitely considered that.  As a long time Apple customer, I have done similar things for Macs.  Just wait till the new MacBook Pro is announced and go buy previous model when prices are dropped. I know my sleep schedule is horrible, I don't need my watch to tell me.",Others

I‚Äôll be happily upgrading but realize that‚Äôs not as big a deal for everyone.,Others
2441,"Coming from a Series 4, I was hoping for more health sensors included this year. I‚Äôd like to upgrade to an always-on-display and a cellular model, I just don‚Äôt really see the Series 7 as enough.",Others
2442,As someone who upgrades every year I would be passing unless the buyer backs out.,Others
2443,Won‚Äôt be upgrading from S3 until blood glucose monitoring or temp sensor and a new SOC.,Others
2444,"No reason to upgrade from my series 6. I upgraded from a series 2 last year and that was a huge leap. No freezing and I'm actually able to use the workout features without a 30 second delay, the walkie talkie actually works great and is responsive, and I can pick up phone calls from my watch without the whole thing freezing or not responding to taps. This S7 doesn't even have a better battery life.",Others
2445,I was seriously hoping for a blood glucose monitor,Others
2446,"Coming from an S3, it's a pretty decent upgrade for me. The annual update cycle hasn't been worth it in basically any product line for a while now. If I had a 5 or 6 I'd likely be sticking with it for another year or two.",Others
2447,I mean you could say that about all of em since series 5,Others
2448,"Watches aren't meant to be upgraded every year just like cars, it's for those with older generations who would be more satisfied.

Obviously, tech enthusiasts would feel it is underwhelming though haha.",Others
2449,"Same processor - S6 chip as last year
Same battery üîã 
Stronger Screen they say but i will still purchase Applecare+ .
So, the real change is 20 % larger display to fit a keyboard and some new watch faces??? !!!!!!
C‚Äômon apple !!",Battery
2450,The Apple Watch is already pretty fucking good - it's hard to iterate on that. I'm buying it - I don't have one currently but I had a S4 that I sold a few years back. I can definitely se the value in this vs the 4.,Others
2451,This was a bait and switch. Series 6+. New processor is annual. No processor. I guarantee it's gonna come out that Apple had to redo the Series 6 with new firmware due to the issues with production. And they can't blame it on the screen lamination because it's all one piece from the supplier. I worked for Motorola making phones here in Dallas almost 10 years ago and you get all the modules delivered from suppliers ready to slap together.,Others
2452,Doesn‚Äôt seem like it.,Others
2453,"I think a new screen was basically the only thing that changed.

Oh there was dust resistance I think, not sure how new that is though",Others
2454,Honestly I was hoping for the redesign to upgrade from my current SE. But I‚Äôll be putting that money towards the iPhone 13 pro max.,Others
2455,This year was more of a cosmetic update. Nothing real cool or exciting! So am off year. Meaning save the money,Others
2456,"My series 5 just died out of warranty, might get the 7‚Ä¶ its a sign!",Others
2457,Yeah it seems really underwhelming. My 1st gen apple watch just popped open and I was hoping that Series 7 would be the obvious buy as the replacement ... but now I just don't know.,Others
2458,From an S3 or 4 maybe. S6 definitely a no for me,Others
2459,All for the sake of being environmentally friendly!,Others
2460,Agree.  Super boring.,Others
2461,Definitely not!,Others
2462,"Yeah, I feel like I am picking a bad time to come back to Apple from Android. I feel like the next releases will be better and I‚Äôll want to upgrade but won‚Äôt be able to justify it.",Others
2463,"My series 4 does almost everything the 7 can do, looks like its a firm no for me.",Others
2464,They justify a release to someone. Maybe not a direct upgrade.,Others
2465,"No. At least not if you have a 6. If I had an older one, yes. 

Maybe if there were other new colors. The dark green doesn't appeal to me personally, but the people who like it might upgrade for that. As for features, I didn't see anything big.

I'm guessing that next year will be the re-design. Maybe that flat design that was leaked will actually be next year's update?",Others
2466,I wont upgrade mine ( S4 ) until i cant get updates anymore.,Others
2467,"Yes, absolutely. Why would they hold tech back arbitrarily? Most folks upgrade every 2-4 years and there is no reason to hold incremental upgrades back.",Others
2468,"It was very disappointing, not worth the upgrade at all",Others
2469,Exactly. God dammit,Others
2470,"I have a S2 and no longer get updates so I'm thinking about it, but i don't think upgrading from the more modern watches would be a big draw, given what they showed.",Others
2471,"As a buyer who is no upgrading from an old watch, it is very compelling.",Others
2472,I would like a band option like what FitBit has. That would be worth investing in.,Others

2474,"I'm an android guy when it comes to mobile, but use Apple Macs. I love the apple watch 7 for all its health features. If I buy one will there be any compatibility with an android phone. Can I use my Mac? Am I wasting my money?",Others
2475,As a first time buyer I‚Äôm loving it. But based on what I‚Äôve seen from previous iterations I don‚Äôt see why someone would upgrade. Same with the phone. I‚Äôm still on the 11. I can‚Äôt justify an upgrade yet based on my own personal use.,Others
2476,"No, this was a Joe Biden sized fuck-up.",Others
2477,I just wanted a better battery.,Battery
2478,"Completely agree with you! Shocked some with the 6 were actually thinking of upgrading in the first place. It‚Äôs still a damn good watch. Heck I still own a series 3 and personally haven‚Äôt found any features worth spending $$$ on. Yeah ecg and o2 are cool but are they reallllly that necessary for the average, everyday user?",Others
2479,"Same. I‚Äôm getting the s7 as my first Apple Watch because why not get the 7 if I don‚Äôt already have one. But it doesn‚Äôt make sense when I see people saying ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs the same as my series 6. I won‚Äôt be upgrading this year‚Äù. These watches should be lasting 3 maybe 4 years. It‚Äôs the same with iPhones. Unless you absolutely must upgrade for work, I don‚Äôt see the need to buy the latest model every year other than to appear wealthy to others.",Others
2480,I know right?  There's no way an Apple watch should be an annual purchase for anyone.,Others
2481,"Yessir, gonna get the 7 as my first Apple Watch too. But if I already had one I wouldn't upgrade",Others
2482,"I only have a 4 but the biggest issue I have with aw is the daily charging.  

Coming from amaze fit bip that lasts up to a month between charges it's a real pain.

Even if I had a 6 I would have upgraded for better battery life",Battery
2483,"Agree - the only thing they could have done for me as a S5 user was a big redesign or significant step forward in battery. There‚Äôs an argument for the health features, but for my use the only big improvement made in the last 3 generations was always-on display. Improved the AW experience for me in every interaction.",Battery
2484,"I think I'm going to upgrade to the S7 from the S3. Bigger screen real estate and ECG are the features I'm looking forward to. I don't need any of the rumored health tracking, such as blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring. Who knows if the watch will actually do those things accurately in the future?",Others
2485,I would get the 6 when stores start unloading stock. I have the 6 and am not upgrading.,Others
2486,"I think it's impossible to impress anyone year to year, but they need to pump it up to excite users with two or three year old devices otherwise they'll feel like even that upgrade is insignificant and wait for a big reveal to upgrade. It makes sense to upgrade from an 3/4 to the 7, from the 6... not so much.",Others
2487,7 due to larger display,Others
2488,I use an app called flicktype keyboard on my 5 that seems to do the same thing.  I barely use it though as it's hardly worth the effort and a lot of the time you can just dictate a message just as easily.,Others
2489,Ditto.,Others
2490,"I‚Äôm keeping my s5 and upgrading my iPhone X, probably to the iPhone 13 Pro. (It‚Äôs definitely time for the phone.)",Others
2491,Trade in on the series 6 is like $150. Won't be much more than that if anything. I'd just go and get the new screen put on the series 6 chassis. That's all Apple did.,Others
2492,They said 100 for my stainless 44m series 4,Others
2493,That's what we said about s7 after s6's marginal improvement over s5 lol,Others
2494,"According to [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-8/), thats just a watchOS 8 feature, not exclusive to Series 7",Others
2495,How is it a bait and switch when they didn't release any info before? Just because you chose to believe leaks doesn't mean you should be annoyed by apple,Others
2496,">I worked for Motorola making phones here in Dallas almost 10 years ago and you get all the modules delivered from suppliers ready to slap together

yes that's clearly the same thing",Others
2497,"Just FYI, the 18 hour battery claim has never been accurate- In practice, the S6 always got at least a day and a half of battery with AOD. I doubt the S7 will consume more power than the S6‚Äôs display, since you‚Äôre looking at pure black more often than not- the total lit up area is prolly going to be very similar to the S6.",Others
2498,"Nah, it's not THAT bad.",Others
2499,"How is apple supposed to have a better battery without making it thick and an unwieldy brick? The only battery life solution is new tech, which won‚Äôt just be an apple breakthrough. The battery life is at its upper limit right now for the size of the watch. It is what it is",Battery
2500,Faster charging is more important than bigger battery imo,Battery
2501,*Technically* it is a better battery but only enough to cover for the faster charging and bigger and brighter display.,Battery

Sometimes Apple surprises us all. I take all these *trustworthy leaks* with the same grain of salt every time.",Others
2504,I might have been tempted if they‚Äôd rolled out blood sugar monitoring or something dramatically new,Others
2505,"The screen size jump from the 3 to the 4 was big for me. Not only size but the fact it isn‚Äôt a weird rectangle. 

Every watch since then, though? Nothing noteworthy. I probably won‚Äôt upgrade till the 4 loses support, or breaks.",Others
2506,"sorry but for someone like me who had the series 3 and couldn‚Äôt even use it as a regular watch without making a weird gesture, the always on was a quick upgrade to the 6. i skipped the 5 tho",Others
2507,"I‚Äôve gone in store and tried the S6, and I think the 41mm in graphite stainless steel is for me. I‚Äôm quite happy investing a little more into it as I plan on keeping it until it‚Äôs pretty much redundant - the titanium model was on my radar but anecdotal evidence doesn‚Äôt seem too compelling it‚Äôs worth that extra cost. It‚Äôs a lovely looking watch tho!",Others
2508,Do you have a guess as to how much the price of the 6 will go down? I have a 3 and my plan the whole time has been to wait for the 7 to come out to get a 6 lol,Others

2512,"I mean, we had a new blood O2 sensor, always-on altimeter, much better always-on display and more on the Series 6. In comparison, Series 7 is a joke",Others
2513,Nice! They were not super clear about that in the video.,Others
2514,Everything but the new screen is firmware driven. From battery saving to faster charging. This watch is a Series 6+,Others

2516,"Where is the new processor this year?  The bodies were already leaked and being sold on the streets in China (same as every other apple design).  Where are the 45mm bands that ""only fit the new watch body"". No one spends that much money on production unless it's gonna happen. The truth is something screwed up and they had to scrap it all in a panic to meet the deadline. Imagine the free fall Apple stock would  be in if it was announced that a watch design already in production with JIT parts orders were trashed. It's gonna come out. Mark my words. We will find out soon the other watch was supposed to be this year with a new processor and larger battery. Apple doesn't just have TSMC spend money making a new chip to toss it out. The new chip info was production info from TSMC. TSMC doesn't do stuff for free.",Others
2517,Actually the process is the same. It's all assembly line. No difference between any phone/smartwatch/tablet. It's all about putting the parts in the frame in order and using the tools that are preset to torque down the screws or apply the two sided adhesive films. Anyone who has done any electronics assembly work can do the job.,Others
2518,"Ok, that's not so bad then. Thanks for taking the time to explain this.",Others
2519,"Well they increased the iPhone 13 battery in the same case as the iPhone 12.

2527,The website did a terrible job explaining the differences between the SE and the regular Apple Watch. Can you help me out?,Others
2528,it will probably be just a bit more than the SE as to not cannibalize SE sales. and not so much cheaper than the 7 to derail the launch of a new model.,Others

It still works fine.
Bigger display would be nice. But new form factor was the sell to me.",Others

I'm back when they add some new health tracking features.",Battery

2571,"For health features you could buy a Garmin or fitbit and this would give you some good health stats, especially the Garmins.
Where the Apple Watch shines is the deeper interaction with an iPhone.  Be selective with the notifications the watch receives and it is incredibly productive - no need to keep checking your phone for important notifications because you‚Äôll have had them delivered discretely to the watch (haptic notifications are more subtle than the likes of garmin).
It‚Äôs nice for example to drop in walking directions in an unfamiliar city into your phone and let the haptics on the watch then guide you. Different taps for left and right and delivered at the point you need to turn.",Others
2572,"At first, I loved having all the features and notifications on my wrist. But I still found myself pulling my phone out for most things. Siri on my S3 became so slow and unresponsive that I flat out turned it off. I took the complications off my watch face except date and weather. I find myself wanting to disconnect more apps from my watch more often than I use them.  

It's a nice workout companion, especially if you can't bring your phone around with you when you do whatever you do. But for everyday wear, I really think I'll spend $400 toward a Hamilton or something nice instead of an S5 or S6.",Others

2576,I wasn't into smart watches at all. I like watches to just tell time and that is it. I picked up a Apple Watch 5 because I wanted to be able to quickly without my phone control my house via homekit. Since I got the watch I love it. I don't use always on face and I get 3 days out of it before I need to charge it again. I have the wifi version not cellular also. I love how it shows me all my notifications and I love the stand and move. It is actually making me get up more via my IT job and I love that. It also works nice with maps and navigation where it will vibrate different when a different turn (left or right) is coming up and it just overall has been a great experience. I would say 100% get one if you have an iPhone and have other apple products because it just seamlessly syncs between them all.,Others

2578,"I have one but am probably selling it. I‚Äôm pretty physically active so I don‚Äôt need  my watch to tell me my metrics other than using a stop watch for tracking my rest intervals. I hate notifications on my wrist as I‚Äôm trying to be more present with my kids and family. I know I can turn off notifications but it is just another thing I have to manage. Also I like to travel minimally but the Watch necessitates packing another unique cable. I purchased a $10 Casio F-91W and honestly have not missed my Watch at all. 

The only exception is music while I am at the gym. Now I have to carry my phone with me but that is not that big a deal as I carry my workout log, a pen and water bottle with me anyways.",Others

2581,"Well, I had the original Apple Watch (Series 0) since 2016 and while I enjoyed it a lot in the beginning, it was never supposed to last more than a couple years since the processor they had in it was a single core. And while the other generations of the watch looked cool, I didn‚Äôt feel it necessary to get them. But once series 4 dropped, I instantly wanted it cause that shit looked sexy as hell but still decided to wait it out till series 5 and finally upgraded from my dying series 0 to the series 5 a couple months ago. And well, maybe it wasn‚Äôt for me but I honestly felt that I was doing perfectly fine with my old series 0 and I wasn‚Äôt really benefiting much from the power and tech that‚Äôs in the latest watch and honestly, the price also made me question the purchase (being a college student will make you question every single dollar you spend lol). So I‚Äôm returning it and sticking with my trusty series 0 for a year or maybe even a couple more.

I‚Äôm a forgetful college student, so for me 1) the feature that allows you to set off a ring/tone on your phone so you can hear and find it is a LIFESAVER 2) I like to have my phone put away so I can be present while I‚Äôm in class, out with friends, etc. Being able to read a text preview on my watch the second it arrives is really nice and allows me to see what people are saying but decide to respond at a later, more appropriate time if it‚Äôs not urgent. If you have the money, get one, it‚Äôs a game changer. If it‚Äôs not affordable, eh. You won‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing. I bought mine from Apple refurbished, been a few years I can‚Äôt remember what series but I haven‚Äôt had any problems with slowness or glitching.",Others
2586,This thread wont be good for my wallet,Others
2587,"I sold mine. 

Bought the S0 on release day and gave it back to Apple.

Tried again with a S3 LTE on release day as well.
It was pretty nice. I could go to the gym without my phone, just the watch and AirPods. The issue was battery and speed. So often it would hang, so often the battery wouldn‚Äôt allow me my full routine at the gym. But it was still pretty nice.

I‚Äôve enjoyed it for one year, then as soon as I stopped going to the gym, I had zero use for it.  

You have to cater a lot to your watch. And it‚Äôs slow to do pretty much anything IMO. I know the latest series are faster, but can‚Äôt really speak about that.",Others
2588,Have had my Series 2 for 3+ years and it‚Äôs one of the greatest purchases I‚Äôve ever made.,Others
2589,"I have been using my GPS Series 3 since launch every day, I use it when running and lifting to track my workouts and it also gets everyday use for not getting my phone out to control music/see texts/ whatsapp/ weather/etc.
Battery life is still good I use it to track workouts for over an hour and a half each day, half of them with GPS, and I still get over 50% battery before charging every night.
So in my case, totally worth it and one of the best Apple products I have owned.",Battery
2590,I think so. I was of the mindset that I didn‚Äôt need one until a friend loaned me his old one when he upgraded. Now when I forget to charge it or don‚Äôt wear it I‚Äôm finding I miss it.,Others
2591,"I never use it other than to track my sleep and use Gymaholic for workouts. I wear it every single day. Never go anywhere without it. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it if you are very active, otherwise don‚Äôt bother.",Others
2592,"I got a Series 3 as a gift a few years ago. To me, it‚Äôs just a nice thing to have (for workouts, for notifications, for its sleek look with the Milanese Loop Band). It‚Äôs not an absolute necessity for me. I‚Äôm certainly glad I have it! But would I spend my own money to buy one? Maybe not. And when I‚Äôm not wearing my Apple Watch, I‚Äôm wearing a regular ol‚Äô analog watch",Others
2593,"Having a smart watch makes life a little more convent. I work with pesticides and instead of having to interrupt  my entire work flow and de-glove to answer a phone call or message I can handle that on the watch with my ""clean hand"" or even my nose in a pinch. The workout tracking helps me monitor how active I am during the day and the whole ""closing your rings"" activity tracking is addictive. I can see how these help people lose weight and remain active. Also, the series 4 and 5 have ekg abilities for those conscious and curious abo8t heart activity. The most important thing as it pertains to safety for me is the fall detection. I work all over the place and if anything happened to me it automatically contacts emergency services. I'd say it's worth it. If you're that curious and don't want to pay full price try a site like swappa for really good deals on new/used watches. I picked up a mint series 4 stainless for well under current model prices. You can even find older models for well under $200.",Others
2594,"You're asking on this sub, so you probably  expect to hear positive things...

I got it to track my swimming workout, and splurged on the LTE version because the ability to take calls without my phone would potentially be helpful. I haven't really used that very much, but it's nice to have.

What I actually wind up using it for is to check the weather and set timers, and I seem to do those multiple times per day and it's very convenient for that. I also get my text notifications on it. All of these save me pulling out my phone. I still  carry my phone, but with a toddler it's nice to be able to do things virtually  hands-free.",Others
2595,"I don't think it's worth purchasing a brand new one. That being said, I recently got mine (used but great condition) and I really like it so far. I just got it so I could get DeltaTrainer, a workout tracker that analyzes your form and pairs you with a real trainer. So far both have been going great",Others
2596,yes. in my experience it‚Äôs best for notifications and directions from maps,Others
2597,"I had every Apple Watch up to and including series 4. Decided it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted from a watch. Charging it every single day was a hassle, always wondering why my battery life was shit, Siri being unresponsive, AirPods sometimes pairing to phone instead of watch and vise Versa. Ended up getting a Garmin instead. 2 week battery life, heart rate monitor, GPS. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back.",Others
2598,Other then working out part I‚Äôd say no,Others
2599,"For me, that was a game changer for notifications. Plus, there are tons of little features that I like, such as Shazam in one tap, maps directions, commands when I'm watching a movie, etc",Others
2600,It doesnt work too well with any Android smartphone I own. :(,Others
2601,"I just love the convenience of it. Seeing exact calories burned is pretty neat. Recording workouts with it. Starting music from it without taking out your phone. Temperature and weather conditions at a glance is great. I‚Äôve gone probably less than 5 days without wearing it since I got my S3 almost two years ago. $200 for a new S3 straight from Apple is a steal, it‚Äôs got everything you‚Äôd need in a smart watch. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it, something I use every day without fail.",Others
2602,The Apple Watch is the true ball and chain of the ecosystem and it‚Äôs absolutely worth it. Apple Pay on the wrist makes for an easy life. Workout competitions with friends get me moving more. Not checking my phone for every single notification.,Others
2603,Honestly apart from looking good (but always anxious about scratching your glass screen) and looking at the time/calories burnt/sleep tracking. I did not in the slightest felt it helped me much. I sold both my s2 and s3 after a few months of using it. It doesn't feel like its a product that one would need at the moment. It isn't yet at its prime i believe. Apple needs to convince us more as to why we should get it.,Others
2604,"It‚Äôs great being able to leave your phone on silent but still know every message/phone all because of a little buzz on your wrist, the same when driving or cycling when using maps, knowing a turn is coming up without having to constantly look at the display of your phone/CarPlay is great. I never wore a watch before the Apple Watch and I‚Äôm 5 years in now.",Others
2605,"I use it so I can go swim for an hour, chill in the hot tub and take calls when I‚Äôm critically required to do so for work. That‚Äôs the only reason I have one, but it‚Äôs a pretty compelling use.",Others
2606,I use the Watch for 95% of all my payments. It‚Äôs so convenient. That alone makes it worth it. Add to that all the other amazing stuff it does.,Others
2607,"I paid $150 for my S1 and cannot see myself paying regular price for this thing.    sure it's interesting to get stats on my activity and sleep but it's all just fluff for me, nothing life changing.",Others
2608,It's so useful to not have to pull out my phone to do most of what I want to do now. I am even typing this on my watch right now.,Others
2609,Hell yeah it is. I like it just as a neat digital watch!,Others
2610,"For me it‚Äôs worth it as it works way better than my old Fitbit, you can see a lot of info at a glance, you don‚Äôt have to pull out your phone to use Siri, can change music easily, check notifications, make phone calls, and it can be set up to track irregular heartbeats.   

I‚Äôm trying to get into shape again but my heart isn‚Äôt in the best shape and the other day said my heartbeat was irregular. I checked on my omron blood pressure monitor to verify and my diastolic and systolic numbers were high. I had to take a pill to get them back to normal. If i didn‚Äôt have this watch I‚Äôm not sure i ever would have known and who knows what could have happened. It‚Äôs nowhere near as accurate as a cuff or chest blood pressure monitor, but you can‚Äôt wear those all the time.",Others
2611,Do you exercise enough and want something more? If not then it isn‚Äôt worth it.,Others
2612,"What I‚Äôve experienced is that its difficult to explain why it‚Äôs worth it until you‚Äôve started to use it. For some it‚Äôs a big purchase and I‚Äôve had several friends say, it‚Äôs too much, it can‚Äôt really be that worth while. It isn‚Äôt until they‚Äôve started to use it that they find value in the watch in their own unique way.

Overtime what I find valuable in the watch has changed. From using it for notifications and not having to take my phone out, skipping songs, now to exclusively being a fitness watch and wearing it every day regardless if I workout because I‚Äôve grown accustomed to having it on my wrist every day. If it broke tomorrow, I would go straight to Apple store to fix it. I lost my workout band a few weeks ago. I was scrambling at 8pm to see where I can go to buy a band so I can use it for my workout the next morning.

TLDR; it‚Äôs worth it but it‚Äôs difficult for me to explain why it‚Äôs worth it until you‚Äôve started to use it for awhile.",Others
2613,"i‚Äôm in the ecosystem already, so i‚Äôm bias, but i really love my apple watch. i‚Äôve only had it for about a month or so, but it has def been a plus for me. the biggest thing is that it keeps me off my phone. i like being able to respond to a message from my phone or (most of all) controlling my music, podcasts, & volume from it. also, as someone who isn‚Äôt as active as i would like, the activity tracking does help push me more, whether during a workout or just day to day. i got it for christmas, but i would pay for one if i had to. also i have the GPS version. i didn‚Äôt need the cellular.",Others
2614,"Do you listen to music often in the gym? Bluetooth in your car? I wear mine every day and my nice mechanical watches are gathering dust, so yeah.",Others
2615,"Incredibly worth it if you‚Äôre active; if you have medical insurance through your employer, check and see if they will reimburse the cost of a base model Watch.",Others
2616,"My 2 cents: It's a great product but you got to see how much friction it adds to your life. I had the series 0,2,3,4. They all ended up being sold. Reason? All the activity features, notifications and whatnot weren't really making up for: having to charge it every day, having to bring one more charger/cable (and therefor have multiple devices charging in different points of a hotel room) with you wherever you might stay more than a day and last but maybe the most important part, there is still no screen that has the same ""under the sun"" visibility as a classic mechanical watch.",Others
2617,"No, it isn't. It's a gimmick, at least for me. Grab yourself a regular watch instead",Others
2618,I‚Äôve owned 3 of them but this S4 might be my last. I should be more active and I do walk/jog the dogs but I never use the watch correctly for it. I like it for notifications but I still pick up my phone so it just isn‚Äôt worth it for me.,Others
2619,I use a fit bit blaze for all the features you mentioned 200$ the apple watch makes calls and  takes pictures more than I would ever want my watch to do. Blaze also tracks my sleep which is very helpful,Others
2620,I had to go to the chiropractor a bunch until I got this. It‚Äôs paid for itself in cost savings.,Others
2621,"My girlfriend has one, but to be completely honest I see it sitting on the charger much more often than I see her wearing it. She never wears it in the house because she‚Äôs always near her Mac or her phone, but she‚Äôll definitely be wearing when we‚Äôre out and about. If I asked her, she‚Äôd say it was worth it, but I definitely do not want one. In the end it‚Äôs value/use is going to be super subjective.",Others
2622,"Allows me to keep my phone in my pocket, complications are super useful and fully customizable, time is dead accurate, control my sound system anywhere in my house, great for the gym and swimming. Oh, and it tells the time.

Long story short, I can‚Äôt go back to a dumb watch.",Others
2623,apple employee here: worth it if you regularly work out,Others
2624,"If you can afford it, it‚Äôs totally worth it. I use it for notifications, fitness tracking, timers, and Apple Pay mostly. If you‚Äôre on the fence, get an older model and see how much you like it.  I also have complications on my watch face so I can see the weather and S&P 500 at a glance.",Watch Face
2625,"Didn't have one working out in the ""old"" pre-smart-device days and I was doing fine without knowing my exact heart rate or calories burned. I have an iPhone 6s and never used these health apps.",Others
2626,Other than for tracking exercising I found it pretty worthless. It still needs a phone to update apps and isn‚Äôt a true stand alone device yet. When it gets there then perhaps it will prove it‚Äôs utility. I don‚Äôt have the latest version so is it there yet? The one I have lives a drawer 95% of the time.,Others
2627,I was never into smart watches either until I got my first one,Others
2628,"I can‚Äôt get used to anything you wear. Tried the watch and it feels like a handcuff to me. Tried AirPods and they felt like ear weights. I guess I‚Äôm just a phone guy. As much as I love tech, I‚Äôm not for wearing it.",Others
2629,"I use mine constantly. My hands are often in gloves or greasy, so it‚Äôs a life saver when I get a bunch of texts, calls, etc. I went nearly a year without one after my Series 0 died, really missed having it. But as the top comment says: I wouldn‚Äôt put myself in the red to have one.",Others
2630,"I bought a series one, had it till the series 4 came out and upgraded.. Not Cellular for both... use it for responding to messages with voice and music changes throughout the day, calculator app is handy, glancing at stills from camera alerts at the house, weather data checks, reminders/notifications, translation app came in handy a few times, SoundHound as it‚Äôs quicker to identify a song without pulling out my phone, all of my wallet purchases at Starbucks and the workplace food market, and the gas stations with the tap to pay, as well as lots of other few time apps uses.. I found it to be essential in my life now and can‚Äôt imagine wearing any of my regular watches from my collection, Aside from the pocket watches on the special occasions (but still wear the AW4 as well lol)  my wife is in the same spot, however she also has a workout routine which she also tracks data with her watch4 also.  Gets plenty of use.  I was worried I was going to damage it at work, so I was wearing a snap on screen cap over my series 1 at work as a carpenter/heavy vehicle parts handler for awhile before I realized the cheap plastic screen protector wasn‚Äôt taking any damage or scuffs so I stopped worrying about that, every time I smack it or rub it on anything I expect a scuff but never anything.  It‚Äôs extremely handy to not pull my phone out at work, as leadership can Hawkeye ya with a phone... worth every penny.",Others
2631,"I really like the fitness stuff.  Other than that, it's a neat gadget.   It doesn't do anything life changing for me, but I like it.  I like notifications for things that I don't get a lot of notifications from, but I turned them off for things like facebook  messenger where the notifications were annoying.",Others
2632,It‚Äôs freaking amazing. Best thing I ever did for my health.,Others

2634,Can't ever use a dumb watch again.,Others
2635,"i shit on apple a lot, but i really do like the watch. the only reason i sold mine is because when i get sweaty at work i hate the way the watch feels on my wrist. i know thats a dumb ass sounding thing to say, but i never could find a band that fit my wrist and felt comfy no matter what.",Others
2636,"I find it one of the nicest, most impressive bits of Apple tech, but not ‚Äòessential‚Äô.

If you consider it like an iPhone ‚Äònano‚Äô with shitty battery life it‚Äôs fantastic. iMessage voice to text is incredible, Apple Pay, run tracking whilst listening to podcasts, etc... I can often just leave phone at home if not out all day.",Others
2637,Mine just sort of irritates me. I bought it two years ago and it was OK for about six months but since then it‚Äôs just gotten gradually slower to the point of frustration. I use it only for tracking my runs and checking the time now and use my iPhone for everything else because it‚Äôs much faster.,Others
2638,Yup I love mine. Had a S2 that I gave to my sister when I upgraded to a S4 bc I wanted a bigger screen. My favorite app on the watch that I say is a game changer from any Samsung Gear/Fitbit is the Apple Maps integration. Turn by turn direction with Taptic reminders on which direction to turn is great. Nothing else can match that that I‚Äôve seen so far and it‚Äôs a perfect feature to never get lost or make a wrong turn/miss an exit.,Others
2639,"Its nice to have but not necessary. Use it for music, notifications, and messaging.",Others
2640,Eh. It‚Äôs a toy not a tool. If you have extra money go for it. I wear mine every day and it‚Äôs just a  notification mule,Others
2641,Weird question but are the series 5 Nike bands different than the series 2 Nike bands?  I recently upgraded and the new band feels thicker and more rigid. Wondering if it‚Äôs just cuz it‚Äôs new.,Others
2642,"For years I dreamed of buying a luxury watch, but couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around the cost. I waited as long as the release of the Series 2 to buy the Apple Watch, and never regretted it. I‚Äôve only ever bought the one and it‚Äôs still ticking. I will confess to being fully imbedded into the Apple ecosystem, and has done as advertised by way of becoming part of daily life.

Long lasting, aesthetically gorgeous, and easily integrated with other Apple products under your direct control. That is what‚Äôll make it worth it. A product to have just to have, maybe not so much.",Others
2643,My watch (4) best thing i ever bought. Worth every penny. Leaving phone at home is fab.,Others
2644,"I've always been a ""watch"" guy, so I like wearing watches. I had the first Apple Watch and thought it was okay, but it was slow and I didn't find the functionality too compelling.

I got a cheap Garmin Forerunner just for GPS and heart-rate tracking. I can‚Äôt replace the battery there either, but at least it‚Äôs only 80 bucks instead of 300.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying 80 bucks every three years - but not over 200. That‚Äôs insane.",Battery
2647,"As owner I wouldn't recommend it. After initial good impressions, at the end of the day the only feature that's gamechanging for me is paying with watch. Other stuff is very usual - notifications, checking weather and setting up timer.

For the activity tracking, it's mostly annoying and builds up a dark pattern of feeling really bad if you've build 60 day streak and then went to a party and slept a lot, you couldn't do the 12 hours on feet chalenge. Also annoying when the app tells you to ""start"" trakcing walking - this isn't something you want to do, should be seamless - maybe it is if u turn it off but the app doesnt tell you that.

But the worst part is that it doesnt look good.",Others

2660,"This is so true. Unlike the AirPods (which I consider similar to the Apple Watch in so far as you don't NEED it), it's hard to say that you use this product everyday. I usually like to explain that I actively notice when I'm not wearing it, and wish that I was wearing it.",Others
2661,"This. I hate my Apple Watch b/c it's another item I would replace instantly if it's lost or broken ;) 

I didn't wear a watch prior, and got a Series 2 on sale one day to check it out. I have a series 4 now and only take it off to charge. I use it for fitness tracking, alerts, and quick info. Good thing about the watch is I don't feel the need to get each new version. Every other version seems like a good cadence.",Others

Not health stats, but sports stats. My Garmin Fenix 3 HR is 4 years old and yet I don't see any non-Garmin watch that could surpass it.

Also, you touched on a great point where you mentioned the convenience of not having to pick up your phone every time to check a notification. You see, while I am doing cardio and listening to Audible with my phone in my pocket, if I get a notification I have to stop and take out the phone to see what's the notification then put it back. I can imagine simply checking the watch will save me a lot of that hassle.",Others

I current have the cell version so I don't remember what the storage is but when I had the standard Series 0 it had plenty of space for a pretty long playlist on it (I never filled it up). 

I love it (paired with AirPods or other wireless headphones) for exercising without the phone. Also (I've had one since late 2015), the most other uses I've got out of it is setting quick timers, notifications, and a much more reliable siri(at least in my experience) compared to the phone.",Others

2702,"Nah if my AirPods broke I‚Äôm automatically buying more and collecting them the same day. going back to wires sucks more than not having a smart watch imo. All the watch does is be a small phone on my wrist, albeit very well.",Others
2703,Rings are my life now,Others
2704,"They all do stand nagging, badges as well as the body battery etc so casual health stats as well as sports stats.
You‚Äôre right about marathons though - I do the odd ultra (walking) and have a separate watch to record this which has a very long battery life. It‚Äôs one less fuss to worry about when you‚Äôre getting tired after 20 odd hours and wondering whether it‚Äôll die on you.
That does remind me though - I‚Äôm old school and have worn a watch for 40 years. I have small wrists and the fenix 1 I had used to hurt no end. The Apple watches (on my third now, from s0) have been the most comfortable I‚Äôve ever worn.",Others
2705,They say this every year. The truth is Apple massively slows every model down with updates. S2 for example was lightning fast at launch and is now a piece of junk. Same thing is kind of happening to S4.,Others
2706,"Absolutely. 

The cellular one means you‚Äôre paying additional $ each month for likely very little gain (unless you would leave your phone behind quite often).",Others

2709,This is so out of touch and ignorant.,Others
2710,"At the same time, $400 (or $200 for the budget/older model) for a device you use daily, lasts 3+ years, and is half the price of a phone isn't terrible. It's not cheap, but compared to other tech products it's certainly not expensive.",Others
2711,If you‚Äôre seriously comparing raw material cost with retail prices you should brush up on some basic economics.,Others
2712,"Well, I mean, my point‚Äôs not that they make a profit or anything like that. I think of it in terms of utility. If they couldn‚Äôt make it for a cent less, it wouldn‚Äôt change my position: I get about two hundred bucks‚Äô worth of utility out of it. I don‚Äôt get four hundred bucks‚Äô worth of utility out of it. How much they make on each unit isn‚Äôt my concern.",Others
2713,And the nice thing is that it's available for other camera apps to use as well.,Others
2714,"I have a cellular S3, and I can confirm it is nice to be able to leave my phone at home, or because my 6s+ battery was crap, I could leave my phone in my truck to charge while out and about, and still be able to stay connected. I upgraded to the 11PM, so I don't have to worry about phone battery life anymore lol",Others
2715,"If I still ran or biked that would be a huge win. I don't do either of those so it's more so I don't have to carry my phone around the house or on a walk around the neighborhood, or can leave it in my locker at the gym. It does cost like $10/month through Verizon for that extra  feature, though, so that may factor into your decision.",Others
2716,"Yeah the cellular model is amazing ! I forgot to mention the music stuff ! Also I love that every cashier I interact with looks at me like I‚Äôm a wizard, paying with my hand and all xD 

Yep, when I go running I can just quickly look at it and only stop for important stuff ! It‚Äôs so convenient",Others
2717,more than enough to put my favorite songs. Thanks for clarifying that.,Others
2718,So if I get the GPS version only it can stream music from the Spotify on my iPhone directly where I an keep the iPhone a few feet away from me while I workout?,Others
2719,"It has an e-SIM, so it basically forwards all calls and texts to the watch. Correct, it'll work on its own even if the iPhone is powered off (Calls and iMessages only and any apps that work completely independently; SMS messages do NOT work with the phone powered off or not on wifi and nearby). With the iPhone powered on and connected to wiFi, you can leave the phone at home and EVERYTHING will mirror to the watch, regardless of where you are with your watch.

So every day I leave my iPhone at home, powered on and connected to WiFi. So I get all notifications on my watch, and in some cases, I can even reply to messages (Signal, Microsoft Teams to name a couple) via voice dictation even though neither have Apple Watch apps.",Others
2720,"Yes, definitely. Especially since it‚Äôs precise.",Others
2721,Then when do you charge it?,Battery

But there is credibility to what you‚Äôre saying!

Happy cake day!",Others
2724,Keep in mind it‚Äôs not even a accurate sleep tracker. It has zero way of knowing how long you spend in each sleep stage. It uses movement and potentially heart rate to guesstimate your sleep quality. Doesn‚Äôt have an SP02 sensor either.,Others

There doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything close to an Apple watch in terms of wearable app integration across so many categories, but headphones just pair, play audio, have a mic, and activate voice assistant, all with some touch or button controls- only the seemless pairing is proprietary to Airpods as a standout feature iirc.",Others

You're the one who should be providing some evidence to back that up, otherwise I'm sticking to my stance which is that your comment is utter nonsense. If the Apple Watch was truly FIFTY PERCENT overpriced, they wouldn't be flying off the shelves and Apple would be forced to drop the price in order to move them. Middle school economics.",Others

Those things are related and he does mention a couple points where Watch OS 6 plays a role (noise measurement is also availible on older watches and he still mentions it) but if you expected a Watch OS review you just watched the wrong video. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know why you did, especially since none of the new features fundamentally change what the Apple Watch is or how it behaves, you know, things that would be actually relevant for an Apple Watch review.

Watch OS 6 has tons of quality of life improvements and little (non-central) feature additions and all of that is nice but listing them all (or even many of them) within an Apple Watch review is, well, it‚Äôs just not necessary or what one would expect.",Others

2777,No it didn‚Äôt,Others
2778,"My difference is around 20-30%.  I‚Äôm not regretting getting a series 5 over 4, but it is disappointing that one of the distinguishing features hurts the battery life this much. It‚Äôs not hard to turn the AOD off so it‚Äôs not something that is a deal breaker. I‚Äôm coming from a Galaxy Watch and while I like the Apple Watch more, the battery life on the Samsung is excellent. I also like the looks of the Galaxy Watch more since it looks more like a traditional watch, but the Apple Watch‚Äôs rectangular shape is definitely better as a touch screen.",Others

Very clearly referring to the other already-existing solutions (pop-up cameras, etc). Not that I think they could/would have done it anyway, seems pretty mechanically stressful for the pop-up camera to go up every time you unlock the device.",Others
2796,"I've got a very particular situation. I went through a few stretches where my right hand and/or arm had bad nerve pain, so I've learned to use both mice and trackpads ambidextrously. My hands *really* hate the Magic Mouse (and a lot of other mice), so I use a Surface Mouse (the only mouse I've found that I can use consistently without pain), and I mostly use the trackpad for scrolling or for when my right hand needs a break. 

I use a lot of art and design apps, so being able to pan and zoom quickly and without contorting my hands is essential (scrolling a lot with a scroll wheel and occasional modifier key starts to hurt, whereas I can scroll in any direction all day with a trackpad). That, and sometimes using the trackpad just plain feels nicer (especially on a smaller screen or work area).",Others
2797,i believe he uses for editing and stuff on final cut like with gestures. You can do **a lot** more with the trackpad than the mouse for certain use cases.,Others

I actually got a lot of compliments from Apple Watch owners for how it looked more like a classic watch and the spinning bezel was always a Wow factor. 

I think the Apple Watch is pretty and pretty great in use but if I had a fancy dinner party (not gonna happen) I‚Äôd definitely pick the gear sport to blend in more with the traditional mechanical watch crowd.",Others

Well that's just not true is it.",Others

2810,Yes. I was debating the se or 3. I eventually went with the 40 mm se but it took me like a week to decide after seeing reviews and my needs.,Others
2811,"One thing to take into account is the memory of the watches. I believe the serried 3 has 8gb while the SE has 32gb. I work at a target and a few people I know with the series 3 have said that they can run out of memory and have to remove some things. 

So factor in that the SE has three times the memory too",Others

Your comment about ‚Äúscrubbing your run‚Äù got me curious so I checked... The Nike Run Club app has that feature (and I‚Äôm sure others as well). But yeah, it is kind of annoying how minimal the built-in workouts app is.",Others

I was hesitant to buy it, but so happy I did. Recommended to my brother and he loves it as well. Cheers!",Others

2843,AW is very mediocre as a workout watch ‚Äì Garmins are much better,Others
2844,"As for those of you who are saying that it would've been smarter to buy a cheaper, running-focused watch: by and large, you're probably right. However, the point I was trying to make is that my top priority was to have a watch that would be 100 % reliable and headache-free (especially when it comes to GPS and syncing), not getting the best bang for the buck or the most feature-rich running watch per se. 

Personally, I do not feel like I overpaid one cent and am completely happy with my purchase. I understand that most other people probably would not feel this way, but I'm extremely picky with stuff not working as they should (as the Airport Express anecdote, I hope, makes clear).",Others
2845,"Nice. I think at you‚Äôre case, I can say there are excellent alternatives at cheaper price and high quality. Amazfit watches are excellent these days, or even Huawei. Yes you could use a less than 100$ Amazfit Bip S for that purpose effectively.",Others
2846,A Coros Pace running watch with far longer battery life and priced around $200 would have been a better buy compared to barely using any of the Apple Watch functionality.,Others
2847,"Thanks for this, really useful! I‚Äôm just about to order an SE for just running and workouts. Have you used Strava on the SE?",Others
2848,Same boat as OP.  I had a series 2 AW but the battery is not lasting even half a day and its freezing up and I mostly use it for working out and running.  I actually picked up a Garmin VivoActive 4 to try out but one thing I didn't realize is that with the Garmin in order to transfer your paid Apple music over to the watch internal storage you have to have a PC/Mac and send it over with itunes and Garmin express.  The fact that I don't own a PC now its all Ipads/Iphones makes it a no-go.  I usually like to run without my phone so I like to have music stored on the watch.  I'm starting to lean now on picking up an Apple watch SE and use it strictly for running/working out like the OP.  The nice thing with the AW if you already have a iphone is how seamlessly it just works.  The garmin is very nice and seems to find GPS quickly but it doesn't quite meet my needs.,Others
2849,"Yeah, the Polar Flow app (which sounds like a meteorological app for tracking the melting of ice-caps but isn't) had this, which is why I more or less assumed Apple's app would, too, I guess. I think Strava's app has this feature as well, not sure though. Not a deal-breaker, more of a would-be-nice-to-have.",Others
2850,WoD is fantastic. I especially like that it maps the run/walk/hike live (even in some cases where I didn't expect it to be able to download a map). Really helpful in unfamiliar areas.,Others
2851,"Also, I must admit that now that I \_do\_ have the Apple Watch, I do find myself tinkering with it way more than I thought I would. And with the whole pandemic thing going on and the upcoming option to unlock my phone with my Apple Watch instead of my stupid masked-up face, I think I will be wearing the watch for grocery runs and so on.",Others
2852,Apple was dodgier than usual about CPU performance throughout the conference. :/,Others
2853,So will the discounted S6 be a better deal than the S7?,Others
2854,Series 5 was also effectively Series 4 with a new (always-on) display and compass.,Others
2855,"In my opinion, this year‚Äôs event was very anticlimactic. Because of the pandemic, I think that innovation for this year was probably difficult to develop, and therefore this year‚Äôs new lineup is just tweaking the old one. Unless you‚Äôre really excited about the 120Hz refresh rate, I would say this is a great year to take a discount and go for the iPhone 12 and Apple Watch Series 6.",Others
2856,Waiting on deals for the S6. My 2yr old S5 is showing signs of wear and the battery life is down to 83%.,Others
2857,"The target market for Series 7 watches is not Series 6 owners.  A few people will upgrade early because they really want to have the bigger screen or fast charging, but new customers and upgrades from 3 and 4 will play a much bigger part.  I have a Series 4 and don't plan on upgrading until it wears out, but if it got broken or stolen, a Series 7 would feel like a very real improvement.",Others
2858,"Pretty minor upgrade but I did laugh when after all the rumors about a square edge they emphasized that it was now ""rounder"" than ever.",Others
2859,"Is this a big deal though? Is the performance of the S6 lacking? 

Or is it more a ‚Äúfuture proofing‚Äù thing to increase CPU capacity? 

If the old chip still is plenty capable is there any point in spending money and effort on making it more powerful if it doesn‚Äôt make any real world difference to the consumer?",Others
2860,There's a reason why Apple didn't talk about CPU in A15 either. Instead they used word play to show it's 40% faster *than the competition*. Which means the competition performance has increased significantly while A15 isn't a big upgrade at all.,Others
2861,I really feel like Apple should have just skipped this release of Apple Watch and started the transition to a 2 year release cycle.,Others
2862,"Damn, Does that mean the series 7 has the s6 chip from the series 6?",Others
2863,Wasn‚Äôt the chip in the S6 essentially the same as the S5 too?,Others
2864,"Also, the watch is the odd one with the official comparison pages on the apple website, it doesn‚Äôt allow you to choose previous watches like the iPhone and iPads. I suspect people will find out that there is actually no ~~kuch~~ much difference between each successive serie.

Edit typooooo",Others
2865,So will series 6 owners get all series 7 features ?,Others
2866,"Wow...is this sub actually learning how to be fans of Apple while still criticizing  them now? 

""It's been 84 years...""",Others
2867,Using last year‚Äôs chip to power more screen pixels sounds a lot like the dreadful iPad 3.,Others
2868,They always mention the chip and how it is better thsn the predecessor.But this time they did not mention anything about the chip in the watch section.,Others
2869,"Yeah so AW8 = same screen as AW7, but new internals and perhaps additional sensors.",Others
2870,"I would have grabbed a S7 had it literally had been a S6 with better battery life. Since it‚Äôs the same battery life, I‚Äôll take a discounted S6 instead.",Others
2871,I don‚Äôt see the issue with this. They‚Äôve done this before. Most people won‚Äôt upgrade their watch year on year. I‚Äôll be upgrading from the S5 so it‚Äôs enough of a jump for me with the addition of the features I didn‚Äôt get by buying the S6,Others
2872,"Don't need more performance in the watch, but a smaller chip with better power efficiency would be very welcome",Others
2873,"So they're going to phase out the series 6 as soon as possible, if they haven't already, so you can't find a better deal on an Apple watch.",Others
2874,"So other than a slightly bigger screen, there‚Äôs nothing new?",Others
2875,I was really hoping for a redesign this year. I will still be upgrading my series 1 though :/,Others
2876,This years apple event was pretty disappointing. More of the same ole and nothing ground breaking and interesting.,Others
2877,It‚Äôs a watch not a productivity device,Others
2878,"I‚Äôve got a se and it‚Äôs a fantastic watch. Will wait another generation or 2 to upgrade, no rush on this.",Others
2879,‚ÄúThe future of health is on your wrist‚Äù ... but no new health sensors. I guess the past of health is on our wrist this year!,Others
2880,Is everone expecting an m1 there? It's a watch and the speed is already good enough for its purpose.,Others
2881,"If you got the S4, you are just 1 year behind in processing power.",Others
2882,"So what? I'm not trying to do quantum computing on my watch.  
It's not a gaming PC that needs to keep up with new ever more demanding games every year.",Others
2883,Funny how all the threads post presentation are about letdowns and deception.,Others
2884,Yup. Holding on to my series 6. What a disappointment. No new features for the S7,Others
2885,Didn‚Äôt the series 6 have the same one from the series 5 ?,Others
2886,yeah. brand new s6 cpu...,Others
2887,"You don‚Äôt need to upgrade every year. My series 4 is alive and kicking with no issues. The added features since then are nice, but I don‚Äôt need to drop $400 every year for them.",Others
2888,"Currently debating getting a 6 while I can. I‚Äôm still on a 3 and wanted to upgrade, but the 7 is just a disappointment. Was really hoping for a 3->4 style upgrade.",Others
2889,"And S6 is identical to S5, which is same as S4. Okay",Others
2890,"series 8 might get an m1. luckily i bought the series 6 at launch, the only complain for me is the battery life sucks and sometimes the watches sensors just lights up even if the watch is not on my wrist.",Others
2891,This sucks I was so hyped to buy a new Apple Watch. I‚Äôll probably just get the iPhone 13 Pro instead.,Others
2892,Everything apple releases is the same as the previous version. It's just the best thing they've ever made. That's the only difference üòÇüòÇüòÇ,Others
2893,I‚Äôm just salty there‚Äôs no black option for the aluminum watch. Genuinely shocked they just didn‚Äôt do it this year. My series 3 is on its deathbed but it looks like it‚Äôll have to stick it out another year.,Others
2894,The entire product event was a joke. So disappointing,Others
2895,It‚Äôs the newest Apple of Apple that ever was Apple. So new,Others
2896,Happy with series 5 watch. Won‚Äôt upgrade until the 10 probably. Just like I‚Äôm finally upgrading the 7+ to the 13 promax,Others
2897,But it‚Äôs got a new hat!,Others
2898,"My 6 was great when new, 2nd to last update ruined it, bag of shit now don't even bother to wear it now. Touch screen terrible don't buy.",Others
2899,It could have the same performance.  But still be more efficient.,Others
2900,Loving my gold stainless steel S4 and wasn't moved enough to upgrade. I still get more than a full day out of the battery (counting my daily workout).,Battery
2901,Add Pandemic and Silicon chip shortages and this doesn‚Äôt surprise me.,Others
2902,I‚Äôm a hypebeast when it comes to the iPhone but it sounds like this is the first year that I‚Äôll be skipping a phone and I‚Äôll be waiting one more year for the watch,Others
2903,"It‚Äôs not the first time they have done this, but at the same time it‚Äôs not a bad thing.

ATP.fm did a great little bit about this exact subject, as Marco said on the watch, efficiency is better than performance, from a dev perspective, as at least for his app, S6 chip was fast enough.
Instead, he would prefer if they could have more CPU for longer, instead of the app being kicked out of memory if it exceeds the limit.",Others
2904,I‚Äôll keep my series 5 and my 8+ please and thank you. Both are working very smoothly and suffering no problems at all.,Others
2905,The sad truth is the volume of the Apple Watch is not huge enough to justify the development and production line cost of a new SoC. I hope we can at least have a 5nm watch SoC next year for the sweet battery life bump.,Others
2906,"I just don‚Äôt get the appeal of a watch at all, let alone a computerized one.",Others
2907,"True courage would be holding off on the uncontrollable urge to release a new product annually and instead to release one every 2 to 3 years when real progress can be made. 

Oh well.",Others
2908,What does it have over last years besides a different look?,Others
2909,"Eh, does it really need one though?

I don‚Äôt think a new one would‚Äôve changed my decision of skipping it at least.",Others
2910,‚Äú‚Äù30% vs competition‚Äù. Ok but what about against last years version?,Others
2911,"""Faster than the best selling chromebook""",Others
2912,"They have been ‚Äúdodgier‚Äù for a long while now. Their comparison pages doesn‚Äôt even allow you to select their old series to compare to the new one, only way is to get a page with each watch and a list of specs rather than comparison. I suspect they also found out that it will too easily reveal that there is no ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù upgrades or difference between each serie. With a new series number they can keep the price on the same level. I think this is good for the used watch market, it does keep old series more valuable.",Others
2913,While true it‚Äôs likely the global chip shortage is the reason.  And they‚Äôre making lemonade out of lemons.  Using what they could get.,Others
2914,Supply constraints are real.  Perhaps even Apple is feeling them.,Others
2915,Given the chip shortage around the world this past year I'm not surprised. I wonder how this will impact the MacBook pros.,Others
2916,"The weird thing was they were happy to mention that the standard iPad has an A13, which is 2 generations old but didn‚Äôt mention anything about the fact the mini now has an A15 and is more powerful than the air. Very weird. Very underwhelming conference",Others
2917,"In my opinion yes, other than the faster charging and larger screen size, I think the s6 might still be a better deal.",Others
2918,"Probably a better deal, but... I want a bigger screen.",Others
2919,I actually got the 5 when the 6 cane out because i‚Äôm not going to hang off a cliff and need to know my blood oxygen and still want always on display so the SE was no bueno,Others
2920,"As of checking in the apple store today the series 6 is not discounted. Only the 12 pro and pro max were. Mini 5th is same price, etc",Others
2921,"I feel like Always On was a game changer, I can see not being of that opinion but that is what made me go from not caring about Apple Watch at all to wanting one. A watch that doesn't always display time is kind of silly to me, but I can see why it might not be to others.",Others
2922,basically we‚Äôve only had one processor bump from S4 to s7 that happened from s5 to s6.,Others
2923,"Still using my Series 4, there hasn't been much reason to upgrade. I've had always on watches before and used to turn the feature off...

Hopefully Apple will eventually put in another sensor, upgrade the chipset, or something next year. Maybe this year was ""redesign"" (I know, not much of one) and next year we'll finally get a bigger upgrade.",Others
2924,Always on is one of the biggest features they‚Äôve ever shipped,Others
2925,"‚Ä¶and S6 was essentially S4 with ‚Äúalways on‚Äù and an O2 sensor (I regret upgrading). Sounds like S7 is an S4 with a slightly bigger bezel and a couple pretty new watch faces, along with the minor tweaks of the S5 & S6. The bigger bezel of the S4 is the last big jump in real improvements I register. 

They might have got me with the blood sugar and/or blood pressure features, but considering the economy I‚Äôm happy not to be tempted to upgrade for at least another year.",Others
2926,We're going to need to wait until TSMC N3 to get major battery life/performance gains on the watch lineup. 2023 at the earliest (N3 will go to iPhone/M2 first in 2022),Others
2927,"The S models are typically an old design with new internals, whereas this is a new design with old internals.",Others
2928,"People probably see that as inferior to a brand new model number now, so Apple doesn‚Äôt do this.",Others
2929,"Agreed. This seems more like an ""S"" release instead of a new model. That being said, the only thing I've been waiting on to upgrade my X was 120Hz. If I had a 12 I'd just wait another year or two, but this should be a nice upgrade for me.",Others
2930,How can you see battery life?,Battery
2931,Same. I‚Äôm rocking my 4 until apple gives me a great reason to upgrade or it dies.,Others
2932,"I'm one of them. The only one I've owned is the S0 (which is now effectively useless as it take like a half hour+ just to turn on) and two things stood out to me with the S7; the larger screen, and that new green color, and then pile on all of the enhancements since the S0.

For the first time since the S0 I'm seriously considering picking one up.",Others
2933,"> The target market for Series 7 watches is not Series 6 owners. 

I'm a Series 3 owner and still don't think the 7 offers enough new features to justify the cost.",Others
2934,"The target market for the Series 7 is anyone who will buy it which includes annual upgraders and everyone else.... Otherwise, Apple would have said: ""We have nothing new to really announce on the Watch side this year. Here's a huge price drop on the Series 6! Wait until you see what the Series 7 looks like!""",Others
2935,My S4 battery isn‚Äôt outstanding since the battery health is 83%.  I‚Äôm considering the S7 but could also just get an S6 at a discount if I see a decent sale and save the difference for a more substantial upgrade.,Battery
2936,I was so ready to buy a new flat design Series 7 and upgrade my Series 4 but no way I‚Äôm buying one now.,Others
2937,I really really like the always on screen (I came from S3 to S5). I think you should try and get a discounted S6!,Others
2938,Keeping my S4 another year,Others
2939,"The new display actually looks quite a lot nicer to me. Smaller bezels, closer to edge-to-edge, more screen real estate (enabling double infograph complications). If you're coming from the S4 you also get Always-on screen, which IMO could be worth it on its own.",Others
2940,"I mean, technically a newer chip would increase efficiency for the same tasks and counter balance the slight more power used to light a bigger screen. Is all theory but you get what I mean since newer chip often means more architecture optimizations and less power consumption per cpu instruction.",Others
2941,"Considering the chip shortage, not changing the chip in this product makes a ton of sense, and basically no one‚Äôs even going to notice any difference either.",Others
2942,Fuck the chip in the series 3 is still good enough for 95% of features,Others
2943,"Exactly you 100% right. More reason not to buy s7 when it‚Äôs basically the same as s6, why even bother?",Others
2944,The whole event felt underwhelming. Good for the iPad Mini though.,Others
2945,"Unpopular opinion, but I think the S7 looks _waaay_ better than those flat-sides renders. They managed to give us the extra screen real estate and smaller bezels without needing to go for the sharp design. It feels slightly less ""new"" but IMO its a win-win.",Others
2946,"Wait, why? Does the current watch really suffer from any performance issues? Hell, I have a series 4, and have never had it feel slow or sluggish to me‚Ä¶ 

For the series 7 they significantly expanded the usable screen area (and therefore readability) on the watch, and it charges faster. Those seem like two great upgrades. What were people expecting?",Others
2947,"It was a new chip, not a huge difference but was up to 20% faster",Others
2948,"No. It was the S5 chip that was similar to the S4. 

The S6 chip actually has 20% performance improvements as it‚Äôs based on the A13‚Äôs High Efficiency cores. The S5 and S4 were based on the A12.",Others
2949,And the S5 was identical to the S4...,Others
2950,"And the S4 before that. However, I don‚Äôt really see the problem. The fundamentals of what the watch is doing hasn‚Äôt changed dramatically.",Others
2951,nah because they're gonna say its only possible with the newer screen lol,Others
2952,Doesn‚Äôt seem like the 6 will get the keyboard even though a watch 3mm smaller than mine can fit it,Others
2953,"The entitlement in here after any Apple event is off the charts. 

Thing is, the more people complain and nitpick on /r/apple in the week after an event, the better the products will sell.",Others
2954,"Easy to say when this means that the watch will become slower sooner than you expected since it came with a year old processor. 

My series 2 was almost unusable and slow as fuck. When I got my series 5, it was all good and then knowing it had a year old processor, meant it might become slow sooner than expected.",Others
2955,You think that the upgrade is worth it? I was thinking to get a S5 ss with a good deal.,Others
2956,I‚Äôd count the screen being bigger and a case modification to be a redesign personally‚Ä¶,Others
2957,When you‚Äôre dealing with that kinda of production capacity there‚Äôs no ‚Äúlast minute improvisations‚Äù,Others
2958,"literally impossible that they redesigned the screen last minute, its too well integrated with the product regardless of any internal parts being affected",Others
2959,Last minute as in 9 months ago maybe,Others
2960,Kinda makes me think you saw this tweet and had to improvise,Others
2961,Yeah.. something like global supply chain issues?,Others
2962,My dude they fed the wrong info to people on purpose to weed out the leakers. People about to get laid off because those leaks were egregiously wrong.,Others
2963,when are you going to learn that when you have a 1 year old product you're not the intended audience for a brand new one... it is kinda lame but the Apple Watch is incredibly slow with these things,Others

2970,"How can it possibly be a disappointment when it's the 6 but with improvements? It literally does everything the 6 does, but better - and you're upset by that?",Others
2971,"Literally the only improvement is the screen. Wow they‚Äôre getting stagnant and that‚Äôs not good. Look at what Samsung is making with their Galaxy Watch, new sensors and processor, new UI. I wonder if this is gonna have a negative impact on the sales of the Apple Watch.",Others
2972,"The S6 was about 20% faster than the S5, but the S4 and S5 are basically the same.",Others

2974,"It‚Äôs obviously not for everyone, but I use mine to track my workouts, and notifications, as I don‚Äôt always have my phone in my pocket. For example when I‚Äôm home a lot during this pandemic. Other than that it‚Äôs useful to track the total daily energy expenditure, if you care about that stuff. And finally sleep tracking, in addition to a silent alarm clock on your wrist.",Others
2975,"It‚Äôs pretty awesome, I love it for my runs",Others
2976,nothing really,Others
2977,"Even better than 30%..., it‚Äôs equal to **100%** of the performance of the gen 6 processor",Others
2978,"The only internal comparison they made was A15 vs the A12 for the iPad mini, which was just an 80% jump.",Others
2979,Yeah that wording got me very annoyed. They used to compare to previous generations before. Now it‚Äôs straight up ‚Äò50% faster than competitors‚Äô. It‚Äôs M1 stats all over again.,Others
2980,"I get what you‚Äôre saying but honestly the CPU does not need upgrading.

It‚Äôs battery life that needs upgrading, so if they could have the same cpu performance with less consumption that would be fine too.",Battery
2981,Also ‚Äúvs the bestselling Android‚Ä¶‚Äù not necessarily the best/fastest Android‚Ä¶,Others
2982,"Even better, they use ""best selling competitors"" which is completely different from ""equally priced competitors."" 

The best selling Android phones and Chromebooks are half the price of the iPhone/iPad!",Others
2983,It must be really easy to get a marketing job at Apple. Just spout random percentages and impressive sounding numbers with no context.,Others
2984,Also how did they compare against the competition since none of them run the same OS?,Others
2985,"Also, what competition?  They would just say ""leading competitor"" without saying which device they were comparing it to.",Others
2986,I bought my current phone in 2017. I‚Äôm now ready to upgrade.,Others
2987,"> The architecture is also still 5nm   

Not to make too many excuses for them, but even in Intel‚Äôs heyday they usually only managed process shrinks every 18-24 months, so it‚Äôs more that it‚Äôs super impressive that they‚Äôve managed to get process shrinks for the previous 2 iterations.",Others
2988,"Nah, TSMC is still working on 4nm, 3nm and 2nm - we have a few years to go, this just isn‚Äôt one of them (next might not be either with the delays).",Others
2989,"Well to be fair, Apple always went two or so versions on the same die size before shrinking it again. And there have historically been some SOC versions that weren‚Äôt a huge upgrade over the last. Apple is also supposedly not coming out with their M2 chips until next year, so maybe they‚Äôre pushing all their efforts in their silicon to next year‚Äôs chips while keeping this year a small upgrade.",Others
2990,"The only specific improvement they mentioned was larger cache, as far as I could tell. Judging from that, I'm gonna say the rest of the CPU is exactly the same.",Others
2991,"They upped the transistor count from 11.8 billion to 15 billion, so there might be some performance benefit there.",Others
2992,Like that's not really the same the battery is puny compare to the iphones makes sense it can fill up that much.,Battery
2993,"To be honest, with how bad the supply constraints are in the industry, I‚Äôm surprised it took this long for Apple to bump into them. But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is the real reason the silicon didn‚Äôt get much for an upgrade across the board. Especially on the watch. If they have supply constraints and use the same CPU for both series 6 and 7, they can allocate what they have to wherever the demand is instead of not being able to sell series 7 because they don‚Äôt have the new chip but meanwhile might have a lot of stock of the Series 6 chip or vice versa.",Others
2994,"I think they omitted this because of the presentation order. iPhones were presented after the iPad but at the same time they wanted to talk about A15 during the iPhone presentation.

So rather than saying ‚Äûit has the brand new A15‚Äú and not go into detail they did not mention it at all.",Others
2995,The s6 already has insane fast charging,Others

2999,"Completely agree, it‚Äôs by far the most important feature they have added. I wouldn‚Äôt use the watch without it again.",Others
3000,IMO always on display is still the most impressive feature to be added since the original Apple Watch.,Others
3001,That‚Äôs the only reason I finally bought an Apple Watch during the launch. I was waiting for AOD.,Others
3002,"That‚Äôs also the reason for me, I waited till the S6 till I was completely fine with the watch.  As an normal watch user an Apple Watch without always on display looked kinda dead to me. Also i didn‚Äôt like the Delay and raise my Handy anytime I want to read the time, just like on an normal watch.",Others
3003,"My Apple Watch is always in theater mode.  I would prefer a watch with no screen but many more biometrics!  I do not use my wrist computer to tell the time very much, just like I do not use my pocket computer to make voice calls much.",Others

3005,S6 had a better chip and a screen twice as bright.,Others
3006,‚ÄúNew design‚Äù lol,Others
3007,The only incentive I can think of is not having to factory reset the device just to upgrade watchOS,Others
3008,"That is true, good point!",Others
3009,"Yeah for most of the stuff, but my S3 has started feeling quite sluggish, so an upgrade might be in its place soon!",Others
3010,"Because, and this might shock you, not everyone already has an S6?",Others
3011,Well even Apple doesnt expect you to buy a 7 if you have a 6. People should stop expecting changes YoY that justify that. Is just not sustainable,Others
3012,"Well yes and no since the design of this watch is different. But if that‚Äôs not a big improvement from your current watch then yes there‚Äôs no point in upgrading. 

Are people expecting such ground breaking improvement to each watch that they will feel the need to upgrade every single year? I think that might be a little too optimistic. But for someone with a S3 this watch looks like it could be a nice upgrade.",Others
3013,"Also bigger, brighter screen, new case. But yeah.",Others
3014,"I skipped watching it all together, feeling like I wouldn‚Äôt miss anything. Looks like I was right.",Others
3015,"It‚Äôs getting to the point where it feels like the equivalent of doing a presentation every time the MacBook gets a small spec bump. There‚Äôs a reason why they announce them though press releases.

But I think Apple needs to do the pomp and ceremony since anything other then that would be acknowledging that the smartphone market has totally stagnated.",Others
3016,I don't think people are giving Cinematic Mode the respect it deserves! That and the iPad Mini upgrades were the only newsworthy things really.,Others
3017,"Haven‚Äôt watched one of the iPhone events in years because it‚Äôs always the same presentation, the iterative hardware is never really that interesting. The new software features presented at WWDC has always been much more interesting to me.",Others
3018,"As I sit on my couch, I can see an iPad, 2 iPad Pros, a MacBook Air, a MacBook Pro, I‚Äôm typing this in an iPhone 12 Pro, and currently wearing an Apple Watch.  I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm their target demographic.  The Apple Watch 7 is disappointing and forgettable.",Others
3019,That comment makes me sad. It‚Äôs like your excluding him. I feel we should all be included when it come to products.,Others
3020,Does anyone really notice that on a watch though? I can't say my S3 needs to be quicker unless it's doing an update. I'll upgrade for the bigger screen and always on though.,Others
3021,It's almost like changes are iterative and you don't have to buy each year's latest model!,Others

The always on display makes more like a watch feel for looks , style , and practicality for usage .. 

The series SE is just a repackaged and rebranded series 4... at a lower price point ..

3349,love the app but can‚Äôt keep them alive! would love the mini game to be something other than activity/steps as that‚Äôs clearly what i‚Äôm already lacking in. agree with another post that my workouts easily earn more than one heart but can‚Äôt bank them. still trying to get past lvl 22 !,Others
3350,"I‚Äôm on Day 30 with my current Nomi, but my step counts keeps resetting.  I just walked for an hour and put in over 9000 steps, but was only able to fill one heart while I was waking.  I was checking my steps often while exercising and saw the heart ring reset twice.  One time my steps were about 1600 steps and the other time over 900 steps, then my ring shrunk. I only have 178 steps now.  My current step requirement is 2500 steps and it will be very hard to keep up if I can get only one heart while my walküò¢

Also the mini game is pretty useless because it‚Äôs almost impossible for me to keep my heart rate over 122 for 9 minutes...",Others
3351,"Is it available in Taiwan? I searched for ""nomi"" and ""nomi pet"" on my watch store but no luck",Others
3352,not coming up on the Hong Kong store,Others
3353,Can‚Äôt find the complication to add to the watch face. Any help there would be appreciated! Thanks,Watch Face

3359,"It says you can‚Äôt move for too long or you will kill it, how long is that? A marathon?",Others
3360,Just bought this. Will it be compatible with the Siri face in future?,Others

3362,This is really cool! Will it operate on the home screen as a watch face or will I have to launch the app?,Others
3363,"Oh wow, this is adorable!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è how do I make sure I keep the app updated if it‚Äôs a stand alone watch app?",Others
3364,"Aw it's cute.. Hopefully I'll be able to purchase this week :) Is the price the regular price or a special launch price? Just need to make sure my payment details, etc are all up to date. I also wanted to point out, that I couldn't find it on the App Store (using my phone) which is how i realized (and re-reading the description lol) it had to be downloaded from my watch. Cool. I kind of like having on my phone just as it's easier to use but, especially with something like this, direct to watch it great!",Others
3365,"This is really awesome! Regarding the crash people have mentioned, it happens when you roll the crown a few times. I noticed it right in the beginning.",Others
3366,"Hi, I just bought it but it didnt install on my AW4. Any idea?",Others
3367,Ka rawe. Well done!,Others
3368,Does the app take the step count directly from the Apple Health app?,Others
3369,"So some feedback - I have a sedentary job, and so being unable to change the number of steps a heart requires to ‚Äúcharge‚Äù really makes this almost hard. 

What makes me frustrated though is that I do get at least 5k steps every day (which should be enough for 3 hearts to keep my dude alive) but the app doesn‚Äôt track steps if it‚Äôs not open? I‚Äôve buried two things in two days - and when I‚Äôm not at my job (before work, on lunch and in the evenings), I‚Äôm on my feet cleaning and caring for my two human monsters. Just cleaning my house today, I‚Äôve walked 2.31 miles, according to Activity. And I have Background App Refresh on for nomi.",Others
3370,I've had Nomi for 3 days now and I have to say its super amusing! I noticed today the amount of steps to fill a heart went from 1500 to 1600. Does that number keep increasing?,Others
3371,I‚Äôm at day 4 and enjoying the process. Well done dudes on a releasing a great idea for the Apple Watch. Any milestone days that I should work towards?,Others
3372,"Love the app. Using it. Fun for sure. As someone else also said, I would love it if it went off calories not steps. Thanks!",Others
3373,Does the step requirement keep going up forever? I‚Äôm getting tired man goddamn! LOL,Others
3374,"Would it be possible to get an update that doesn‚Äôt rely only on walking? While we‚Äôre in lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I get almost no walking and am having to do yoga and strength training instead...",Others
3375,"Mine keeps dying overnight :( is there a pause feature or something that would keep it alive? I don‚Äôt like to be super active right before bed (leads to fitful sleep for me), so by the time I‚Äôm headed to bed I don‚Äôt have 3 full hearts to keep it alive through the night.",Others
3376,Instant download for me! I‚Äôm a huge fan of tamagotchi and Pok√©mon Go. This app combines the two and it‚Äôs awesome! Thanks for sharing!!,Others
3377,My nomi doesnt register any steps at all so its always dying. Am i doing something wrong?,Others
3378,"Hey! Absolutely loving the app so far! My nomi, named Dollop, is on day 12! Such a great motivator for movement. I know you are really great about getting feedback so I just wanted to let you know about a small thing I noticed. Every time I feed Dollop the chewing animation gets a bit jerky and frozen. Not a huge deal but wanted to let you know what I noticed. Can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next. Great job!",Others
3379,"I am enjoying the app, but mine randomly crashed at 10-11 days and started over. I know he didn‚Äôt die, he had 3 full hearts 1 hour before it reset. I was kind of upset, had to start all over.",Others
3380,Using the app for about a day. Very helpful during current social distancing and quarantine. Any plans to add complications to the activity watch face?,Watch Face
3381,I was able to feed ‚Äúnomi‚Äù even when the ring was not filled. I can say with certainty because I was keeping tabs on step count. Wondering if anyone else had the same experience. On day 23!! 6000 steps during quarantine is a stiff target.,Others
3382,"Look like everyone‚Äôs Nomi is looking the same ? Mines looks like that too ?
Also they grow into different animals/reptiles o or whatever ?",Others
3383,The recent update caused the app to reset as the brand new install. Lost the 38 day streak!! Anyone else had the same issue?,Others
3384,"Hi! I love my tamagotchi! But I have a big concern about the new update. It has been 43 days. It just evolved again. Contrary to the update, my nomi has been eating whilst asleep. It almost died today. Can you please review this problem?",Others
3385,It‚Äôs not anymore! Problem seems to have resolved itself. Thank you!,Others
3386,"I love this idea!! I just downloaded the app, looking forward to playing around with it ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Others
3387,"Hello! Maybe it‚Äôs because I have the smaller size watch, but since the new update (which was great for the rest btw!)[I can‚Äôt seem to see the amount of days my Nomi is alive for.](https://imgur.com/a/RpPT17e) Is there a way to fix that or check it out somewhere else? Thanks!üòä",Others
3388,[Finally hit 50 days üéâ](https://i.imgur.com/03TVoi5.jpg),Others
3389,My nomi ‚ÄúFreddy‚Äù is currently 66 days old. Do they live forever or is he gonna start getting old soon? Lol,Others
3390,My second Nomi just died after 83 days because I forgot about it. Looks like the devs forgot about it too? Haven‚Äôt seen an evolution between 50 and 80 or something. :-(,Others
3391,"Apple is ending support for force touch in watchOS 7. I‚Äôm testing iOS 14 beta not the watchOS 7, will you be updating the app?",Others
3392,I‚Äôve lost a few pets now and I would legit have paid real money for a revive. ¬£5 would have been yours.,Others
3393,Nice! Do you  have a way for test it out without paying? I am in Canada and your only review are 1/5.,Others
3394,Lol! Don‚Äôt cheat! Walk around in circles at least. Keep safe out there!,Others
3395,I LOVE THIS!,Others
3396,That's really important. Some guys cant find the app and give you a bad rating :(,Others
3397,"Ah! This happens all the time. We're trying to be one of the first to have a stand-alone Apple Watch App, meaning it doesn't need a companion iPhone app, like the rest.  


To fix it, follow these steps:

* Go to the App Store **on your Apple Watch** 
* Scroll all the way to the bottom until you see **Account.**

3418,Thank you! Please let us know your honest opinion. It's designed to be a passive experience. Best of luck keeping your Nomi alive!,Others

3427,So wholesome of you! Thanks for hatching your Nomi!,Others
3428,"Heya! It's all part of the experience. When your Nomi hatches, it's gonna be hungry! Luckily, you're granted a free Heart to feed it! Just tap on the Heart above its head and it should be fine for most of the day!",Others
3429,Nawwww. So glad it found a good home.,Others
3430,"This was so important to us earlier on, but after we investigated, there's no way of doing this unless Nomi is 'tracking a workout'. Having workout tracking on all day would mess with your Health records and also drains the battery quite a lot :(

We resorted to a notification everytime Nomi dropped a heart as a temporary solution until we find another way.

How long have you managed to keep your Nomi alive for? :)",Battery
3431,"You are very welcome! 14 days is such an achievement, if you survived that long on the old step count, the new should be a breeze. Glad you're keeping fit. Stay safe!",Others

Try searching for 'nomi' or 'watch pet'",Others
3437,It should!,Others

Nomi needs care to survive. Every step you take fills the ring above your Nomi's head. When the ring is full, tap it to feed your Nomi! This happens after 1500 steps (on the first day ‚Äî¬†it gets harder but it sounds like you're doing so much more than needed!) 

Please let me know how you go.",Others
3502,"Hey there! No, the app doesn't have to be open for your Nomi to count the steps.",Others
3503,"Hi squeakincowbuscuit we've now lowered the steps to cater for the Covid19 saga and are working on more features, we'd really appreciate a positive review in the app store if you're still loving your nomi and have a few spare minutes. Thanks for your support!",Others

3508,"Today, it does! The challenge is to keep Nomi alive for as long as you can as it gets progressively harder! In future you might even compete! How many days so far?",Others
3509,Would something like a calorie count be useful to you?,Others
3510,It doesn't at the moment but we are working to make it a bit easier in our next update which is coming very soon. We hear you!,Others
3511,You are legendary. Thank you so very much! Good luck keeping your nomi alive!,Others
3512,"Hi there, thanks for your support! Did you give the app permission to use your step data from HealthKit?",Others
3513,"We‚Äôre fixing that in the next update happening in the next few days! Day 12? Wow, I think you‚Äôre among the top! Thanks so much for your feedback. There‚Äôs heaps to come!",Others
3514,"Hey buddy, sorry there isn't a way to bring Nomi back. That's part of the challenge and the difficulty of owning a Nomi. I wish you better luck with your next one and hope you can keep it alive for as long as possible! Let me know how many days you manage to keep it alive for :)",Others
3515,"Really sorry to hear about that, we havent heard about the app restarting like that but we've recently fixed a bunch of bugs and have also lowered the step count. Please feel free to let me know if you're still getting any errors and we'll look into it. 10 days is a huge effort. üôåüèæ",Others

3517,"Thank you for supporting us! It means a lot. Yes, we do! Any complication with a circular image will be supported in the next update.",Others
3518,Done!! Congrats your #16 on health & fitness.,Others
3519,"I'm so sorry. That sounds like a glitch! I'm not entirely sure why something like this would happen. My co-founder let me know that it could have been an iOS update issue. To quote:   
‚Äî¬†""There was also an OS update recently, it‚Äôs possible the file was encrypted and when the app went to read it it got the handle to the encrypted file (as she hadn‚Äôt put her passcode in yet after the software update). The app would then effectively treat it as new and then when she reset it found the old file (which had died).  


This is a complex and highly unlikely issue. Once again, I'm sorry this happened to your partner's Nomi after surviving for so long!. We'll try continue to try to solve this issue.",Others
3520,"Hi there! Whoah 43 days is an achievement!! Im very impressed! 

I‚Äôm sorry to hear that - just to clarify do you mean it‚Äôs been losing hearts overnight?",Others
3521,Hi Laletje! Thanks for letting us know! Could you please send us your watch series and size?,Others
3522,"Hi Gotstrom thanks for messaging, the app uses health kit so should update with the same amount of steps as your activity rings. Could you check if your Nomi is on the step counter or if its on the energy counter? Hope this helps üòä",Others
3523,Congratulations! 50 days is huge! Is Franz still going?,Others
3524,Hi there! I'm so sorry for the late response. Nomi lives for as long as you keep the streak up for! 66 days is a huge achievement ‚Äî¬†is Freddy still alive and well?!,Others

3526,Died reading this,Others
3527,"Hi there! This is my fault. I should make it more obvious, but when you press the ring with the heart in it, you can feed your Nomi! 

Here‚Äôs to hoping you give it another shot! Thanks for the super useful feedback.",Others
3528,"2 quid is too expensive, has a 1k phone and spends 400/500 on a watch but won‚Äôt pay 2 quid for app.",Others
3529,It‚Äôs the price of a coffee. Sometimes it‚Äôs fine to take a little leap of faith every now and then.,Others
3530,"Yeah, it's been hurting us. We hope Apple do something about this soon!",Others
3531,Thank you! It‚Äôs downloading as I type. Will it work when I‚Äôm using my stationary bike?,Others
3532,Any plans to add it as a corner complication with a ‚Äúhealth‚Äù bar to know where the little dude is at on food?,Others
3533,I put it on the dock and when I go to open it it crashes,Others
3534,"When you feed the pet, does it start the step counter over from zero? Or does it carry over excess steps? Most of my walking is done in large bursts.",Others
3535,"Oh that was my mistake, I searched on the iphone‚Äôs watch section/got into the normal store I guess. Many thanks, found it on the watch.",Others
3536,"Ahh, I missed that! Okay. Got it. Poor guy's gonna die because I didn't tap him on time.",Others
3537,"That's spot on queerestqueen! You've absolutely nailed it. Sorry for the lag lend27!  


To add, you'll also note that the number of steps per heart goes up each day by 50, meaning it's harder to keep your Nomi alive every day!",Others
3538,Op add it in post ... it‚Äôs helpful,Others
3539,For some reason it says i‚Äôm not logged in on the watch app store app. Even though i‚Äôm logged in on every possible settings menu,Others
3540,Well I‚Äôm a mobile QA engineer and occasional iOS dev so will let you know if I come across any bugs. But congrats. ü•≥,Others
3541,Also it said ‚Äûget the Nomi Watch Face‚Äú or something similar. How?,Watch Face
3542,"Is there any guidance on what needs to be done for it? How many steps? Is it automatically fed? I‚Äôve walked about 2,500 steps since downloading and the top circle has filled but the bottom bar of hearts only has a partially full one. Maybe a little ‚Äúhow to play‚Äù on a left or right swipe screen?",Others
3543,"I‚Äôm excited, I also sent this to a few friends. I‚Äôm an engineer on a tugboat so work is too dangerous for my Apple Watch.",Others
3544,Is there supposed to be a complication for the infographic face?,Others
3545,Already way ahead of you üíú,Others
3546,"I only noticed it during setup! So far, all other screens have been fine. But all the screens during the setup steps had it. I hope that helps enough!",Others
3547,TBH I uninstalled it because it was so buggy.,Others
3548,"I can definitely post up a review! I have a suggestion like maybe being able to put Nomi to sleep with a slower rate of heart depletion at night since he‚Äôs sleeping, or for not so active days. I‚Äôve had 2 Nomis die overnight one was 7 days old the next was 14 days old almost to his 3rd evolution :‚Äô-(.....I‚Äôm on my 3rd Nomi his name is Clyde.",Others
3549,You got it! Keep it comin‚Äô :),Others
3550,Three days - since downloading the app. Can‚Äôt wait for it to grow :),Others
3551,If i could go to work I wouldn‚Äôt have any problems to get the steps but right now at home it‚Äôs harder :),Others
3552,Not on full lockdown no. I'm in NYC. But I'm WFH so I'm not commuting (which is my big walk daily) and we are trying to limit our outside time.,Others
3553,"I‚Äôm constantly tempted to upgrade, but I currently literally only use it as a Watch. So it would be wasted on me...he says wanting to play with a Tamagotchi.",Others
3554,I found it now. Turns out out the voice commands for Apple watch in norwegian makes it a struggle to find.,Others
3555,I've kept Roger alive for FOUR days! I'm genuinely enjoying this app! He's very smily today as we went for a run and later we're going to walk the dog.,Others
3556,Thank you. I‚Äôll try it out later,Others
3557,Hey! I would love to review - is it possible to do that through the iPhone or do I have to use the watch to do it?,Others
3558,"Thank you for the response! But I do not have the Apple store app on my watch :/ I‚Äôve tried looking in my phone and watch settings to see if it was switched off or hidden but nothing :(( I really want to play soon but still running!!

Edit: I do hope Apple fixes this soon too :(",Others
3559,O I didn‚Äôt get it cause it costs money :/,Others
3560,Done :),Others
3561,Aaaaa haha ok. Another question though. How long does 1 heart keep my precious little blobby alive for?,Others
3562,"You see, I love little apps like this that encourage people to go walking to take care of somebody or something else. Before I got a smart watch, I was playing Pok√©mon Go, before the main series games went to shit. I was primarily playing so I could transfer all the Pok√©mon I catch irl to my console game but with Nintendo keeping over half the Pok√©mon in the Pok√©dex out of the main game, I quit cold turkey and got myself a smart watch. Anyways, outside the rant, I loved having a tamagotchi as a kid and it looks like you recreated quite the similar experience! I commend you for that and look forward to seeing you port it to the google wear store.",Others
3563,I downloaded it however the steps do not sync up properly with the health app,Others
3564,"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôll give it a shot. It‚Äôs hard to reproduce the crash, (I know that makes it harder to diagnose but it is what it is)  so I‚Äôll report back after a bit to let you know if the crashes disappear. Since Series 2 is a bit older/weaker than the latest models, have you tested the app on a Series 2 device?",Others
3565,"Cool cool! Thanks! It‚Äôs really cute! Excited to see what the baby blob turns into. I‚Äôm also super jazzed that it‚Äôs low maintenance. Just steps. Though, it would be nice to be able to adjust the steps per heart. For myself, I‚Äôd love for it to be around 5k per heart. :) 

Thanks for making this! Hope it‚Äôs a success!",Others
3566,I‚Äôve already finished a workout since downloading!! Congrats on the app release üëæüëæüëæ,Others
3567,Is it the number of days I‚Äôve kept it alive?,Others
3568,Another thought would be to have Nomi not go through food while the watch is off the wrist and charging. We‚Äôve both had one die while it‚Äôs on the charger.,Others

3574,Oh! I misread. Silly mistake.,Others
3575,Thanks! I searched Nomi in the App Store but didn‚Äôt find it...what does the icon look like?,Others
3576,"Great, thanks!! I'll grab it as soon as I can. I may wait a bit long, as was reading the comments and seeing some of the people having issues are S4 / S4 LTE users and that's what I have. But may still purchase now, even if I wouldn't be able to use it yet lol",Others
3577,Thanks. Got it now,Others
3578,Yessss. I‚Äôm so excited for updates! Thank you for creating this!,Others
3579,I‚Äôm at day 8 and looking forward to the next milestone change!,Others

3581,Any chance to delay that until after the quarantine is lifted? I‚Äôm at 8 days.,Others
3582,That would be perfect!,Others
3583,Only thing I can‚Äôt find is a ‚Äútip‚Äù option. Id love to supper the development more. This app is honestly so awesome and the user interface is very clean and visually appealing. Good job!,Others

3587,üëè looking forward to the update. Hoping the redesign will be intuitive and accessible similar to force touch!,Others
3588,They have my money and their response kept me from seeking attention in the Apple store. Your money isn‚Äôt needed.,Others
3589,"Also, this is the screenshot of the 2/5 review: https://ibb.co/6DvQJCv
You responded to it.",Others
3590,"Of course your development costs need to be paid for. But that's independent from letting people try your product for a few days before they switch to premium. I tried all the virtual pets on the app store and they are just not great. Right now, I can't buy an app based on two screenshots and one 2/5 review, so I'll wait for other people to post reviews first. Good luck on your app, the screenshots look great!",Others
3591,I've taken my fair share of risks on apps that were buggy and unusable. To each their own.,Others

I didn‚Äôt see your initial reply, but I hope your mood is better! ‚òïÔ∏è",Others

We'll add it to our list of upcoming features :)",Others

3596,Hi there all the crashes should be fixed now plus a few other changes. hope you're now enjoying the Nomi app. We're working away to add more feature but in the meantime we'd really appreciate a positive review in the app store if you had some time to spare üòä thanks again for your support.,Others

3599,Great idea. Hmm ‚Äî¬†how do I edit a title?,Others

And if you actually are a paramedic THANK YOU for your work in these tough times üôè,Others
3602,Thanks for grabbing it! The 'Modular' face should allow you to add it as one of the small circular complications ‚Äî¬†you'll see its face and how it feels right on the complication!,Others

3606,Hangry Nomi does get pretty sassy!,Others

3608,"Not yet, there's only one for the Modular face for the time being. We'll make a note to add it in the near future for you!",Others
3609,I'm so sorry to hear that! We have been working super hard to squash those bugs in the last few weeks. I hope you could give it Nomi one more chance!,Others

Is it not counting steps?",Others

3622,"Thanks for this, we'll take a closer look into this right away. We hope to solve this with our next update!",Others
3623,"Ahh yes, I think they're there by default, we'll add it to our backlog. A work-around for the moment would be to put your watch on mute. Hope that helps! Thanks for the feedback.",Others
3624,It's a smiley face on a white background! Can you try to search from your watch's App Store? Try searching 'nomi' or 'watch pet' and that should return the right result! Many thanks for your support!,Others

3639,Fair enough. Then just wait instead of asking for something for free. Easy as that.,Others
3640,2nd Edit: alright guys I get it. I‚Äôm cranky and it was a joke. Sorryyyy. I shall get over meself.,Others
3641,That is a BRILLIANT idea. Thank you!,Others
3642,"Looks really interesting! Is there a reason for using steps instead of calories, though?",Others
3643,Thank you. I think these sort of features would definitely be a huge drawcard for those in quarantine and wanting to keep fit.,Others
3644,"Yes, but i meant as not a circular complication; i tried putting Nomi as a corner complication but the little dude isnt an option for it. I was hinting at a possibility of a corner complication with a sliding bar showing if Nomi is on the lower/mid/high end of ‚Äúfood‚Äù at the current time, if that makes sense?

Try replying to your own post and then ask any of the mods if they can pin the comment to the top.",Others

3654,"So far I haven‚Äôt opened the app that much to be honest, between self-quarantine and working from home. The feeding animation seemed a little laggy but otherwise so far so good. I‚Äôll post back with some long-term results in a couple days, hopefully with good results haha.",Others

3676,Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. That must've been frustrating. By 'reset your Nomi do you mean your Nomi died,Others

3683,"I wanted to let you know that I reinstalled Nomi and I've been super happy with it! I didn't realize Nomi would evolve into all these cute forms! Super fun. The bugs are gone and it seems like you fixed the error where it didn't show the number of days I'd kept Nomi alive (looked like a formatting error, it just showed ... instead). Great app, glad I paid for it!",Others
3684,"Yes, i can do that :), oh and i don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs a bug but my nomi hasn‚Äôt grown since the update, I wonder why :)",Others
3685,Haha yeah awesome. Shame blobby died on the first few days of quarantine. Hit harder than I thought tbh. Not starting another life until I can leave again or I will be going through them so fast. He got a good 9 days though,Others

I know some people have requested to change steps to calories, but I really prefer steps! Will you please keep steps as an option, too?  I walk and can keep with with increasing steps, but calories maybe much harder as I'm not a very big person - even I walk a lot, my calorie consumption may not be nearly as much as larger people.",Battery

3710,Same issue here. I try to hit cancel but when I push start on the watch it goes back to same message. Never starts. ,Others
3711,Go to your settings in Pokemon GO and turn off adventure sync and then back on. it should ask if you want to turn on a setting. fixed mine.,Others
3712,So the Pogo app isn't showing there. I thought I had done it right but obviously not? Any idea how to get it setup to show here? It does show up in Health ,Others

3714,I have had the watch since this post and still haven't solved it. Just nother stupid thing from Niantic,Others

3716,I‚Äôm having the same issue myself. I can‚Äôt figure it out. :/,Others
3717,I have figured it out. This mystery. I opened the health app. The white square with red heart at top corner.  Make sure your watch is listed in there AND Pok√©mon go is listed under app section. If you want screen shot just email me at allgottago@mac.com and I‚Äôll send them. I hope this helps at least one person! ,Others
3718,Try toggling the motion and Fitness off in the settings first.  Then toggle the adventure sync off and on in the pogo app.  Then  check the sources in the health app.  It should trigger pogo to appear there. ,Others
3719,Go to the apple health app and switch all on under resources. It worked immediate for me,Others
3720,Just wear it. It‚Äôll count your steps a touch more accurately and report them through adventure sync. I haven‚Äôt used the Watch app since adventure sync went live,Others
3721,"You are correct. This worked for me when I went into health app, went to sources at bottom, clicked on Pok√©mon go, turned off all categories, then turned on all categories. I went back to check the watch and boom now it works again. I have found that while app is active in the watch you can spin stops while moving faster then normal. Although I should never condone driving and playing (some of us do it) it helps with spinning stops at 25 to 30 mph.. sometimes more.",Others
3722,I just mean overall. Pogo seems like a shitshow (should have known) so what other apps are sweet on it?,Others
3723,"Oh wow. Thank you, that worked!!",Others

3728,Do the watch reviews normally go up around the same time? I‚Äôm guessing there are less people that review them compared to the phones ,Others
3729,"[Just watched this Chinese review on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/kqz67DkJfvE?t=8m2s) You don't have to understand the words, but starting from the timestamp I link, there are quite a few samples that demonstrate that XS is a huge step forward in terms of camera performance compared to X. To sum up:

* Pixel size grew from 1.22Œºm to 1.4Œºm and gets deeper, all in all allowing 50% more light in (this part is from another review I watched)
* Number of Focus Pixels have doubled
* Significantly improved low-light performance
* Significantly improved HDR performance (especially at night with harsh light sources)
* Live HDR preview in the viewfinder
* Main camera's focal length gets a bit wider from 28mm to 26mm
* Stablized front camera video recording
* Stereo sound recording in videos",Others

3740,"I‚Äôm thinking about upgrading from a 6 to possibly the Xs but likely the X (though it‚Äôs no longer for sale though Apple...). I‚Äôm not a fan of losing the headphone jack, so once I do this I‚Äôm mostly forced to go Bluetooth because I often have to charge and take calls at the same time.

&#x200B;

Can the iPhone Xs or Xs Max shoot portrait mode with the adjustable bokeh using the wide angle lens or is it still just the telephoto?  I have the 8 Plus and only being able to use the telephoto for portrait annoys the hell out of me.  I had the Pixel 2 XL and it used software (like the Xr) to implement portrait mode using the wide angle lens.  That's all I want and would upgrade for this feature alone. ",Others
3761,How do you make tables in reddit,Others
3762,"Wow, it's crazy how much better the XS camera and A12 is than last year.

I swear Apple silicone cases last exactly one year as mine is starting to fall apart just like it did after a year on my 7+. ,Others

3781,"Agreed, in most cases the Pixel 2 shots looked better imo. But especially that comparison with the Canon 5D left me not very impressed.",Others
3782,Pixel2 deals with eliminating noise better but it seems there is a lack of lens distortion correction? The poor woman's head looks pinched in the pixel shot. Also interesting the bar shot the Pixel2 has a strange ghost effect on the fan blades. Almost looks like the technique used by the micro 4/3 cameras to get a 40mp shot by doing pixel shift stitching (which would improve details in shots). My take away is that phone cameras are all just using a lot of software tricks now to get passable shots.,Others
3783,Is that really surprising? Apples cameras have been middle-of-the-pack for a few generations now and they didn't make any big steps forward this year to correct that.,Others

3799,"Has anyone that's used the camera understand why they call it out as ""good not great?"" Is it a step down from the iPhone 8/X? Seems like it should be better, or is it just a relative comparison and there are actually cameras that blow it out of the water?",Others
3800,I‚Äôve never cringed so hard on a tech video before this one.,Others
3801,"So I think one of two things happened:

1: it was all a PR stunt. It definitely got people talking about the verge, and although they got disliked into oblivion, people were making reaction & mock videos, getting people to talk about them even more, etc. great for clicks = ad revenue

2: it was the kids first or second time building a PC with little help. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen him before, maybe it was one of his first jobs on camera and he built his own PC, so he volunteered and the boss gave him the green light. I don‚Äôt even really blame him because he was so young and unknowledgeable, producers should have spotted some of the problems",Others

3810,"Hey so this is the first time I've really ever looked into an upgrade, is there a difference between using a carrier contract and getting it straight from Apple?",Others
3811,"The XR was almost the perfect phone for me because it literally had everything and no extra bells and whistles that I don‚Äôt use like 3D Touch. I just couldn‚Äôt get over the lack of a 1080p screen. I get that maybe it‚Äôs not so bad, but for 2018 it‚Äôs sort of the principle of the matter. You should have at the very least a 1080p lcd screen. ",Others
3812,"The only negative about the max besides the price and the pathetic 64gig option is, it's just a bigger iPhone but isn't modified in any way in the software to take advantage of the bigger screen like the note 9. Regardless, enjoy it! ",Others
3813,I personally want a smaller display. If they had half the bells and whistles in an SE footprint then I‚Äôd pay top price to get it. ,Others

3819,"Exactly! As a current 6 owner eagerly awaiting my XS, I am hoping the camera jump will be ridiculous.",Others
3820,"That's how tech reviews work. Tech reviews always compare the last version to the newest. Most tech reviews won't compare it to 6, 7, 7s, 8, 8+, X. There are just too many versions to compare. People want to read what new features were introduced. Not a recap of the last 3 years. ",Others
3821,You're right. I noticed that too.,Others
3822,"I actually prefer for phones to look the same for 2-3 years while being refined, similar to cars. Gotta give the design time to mature and iron out problems. ",Others

3846,That‚Äôs just one point of view. Another might be that most users charge overnight and don‚Äôt need to be encouraged to use a fast charger which will cut the lifespan of their new phone when they don‚Äôt need one. Another might be that must users don‚Äôt touch the adapter and it‚Äôs both a costly inclusion for Apple and the environment. ,Others

3869,"I've always found it odd that there hasn't been a Macbook or iMac review since 2015. Anand's coverage of Apple's hardware boosted the site's reach far beyond what regular hardware did back then, and once he left any hardware reviews coverage for Apple's notebooks dropped off rapidly.

Could they not have made it look better than that?  Why was the subject so blurry?  I feel like the XS must have been capable of a better quality capture than that...?",Others
3884,Meh I'd say they're only really challenged by the Pixel 2XL in every condition and by the S9/Note 9 in low light. I hated how my Galaxy S8 would make peoples faces look like plastic even when I turned off every smoothing feature I could find.,Others

3891,"I have the X, and I'm in the IUP so it would in a way cost me nothing to upgrade to the Xs, but I just... eh.  It's going to be basically the same phone.  I might just hold on to me X and then sell it next year to get the XI or whatever.  Or maybe I just don't need new phones anymore :-/",Others
3892,"I'm getting an AW S4 ... I kind of almost wanted an X last year and laughed at the price. My 7, like yours, is totally fine.

There‚Äôs still some good coverage. I enjoy their space coverage and Dieter‚Äôs stuff. Nilay seems to be more hands off these days but his iPhone and HomePod reviews were good.

However, the new journalists need to brush up.  I haven‚Äôt been impressed by what they‚Äôve done so far compared to the old ones.  I‚Äôm getting a it‚Äôs just a job vibe from them.

3935,"Sure there is. I want to see a review based off of someone who would load a normal ammount of applications and configure it for daily use. I'd like to see an evaluation after they've used it for a bit and point out what they like and what quirks the phone has. Every phone I've owned had a great first day / few days experience and after a bit they all showed their own bugs.

Unboxing a phone and powering it on isn't enough for me to trust the review as reliable. ",Others

3942,No. Doesn't work even with Opera's VPN.,Others

3944,"It‚Äôs similar but has bigger pixels, a new ISP and does more on phone computations for hopefully better results. But the cameras are extremely similar. ",Others
3945,The verge said it's better than the X but still not better than the pixel 2,Others
3946,Nobody _needs_ these phones. ,Others

4334,"That‚Äôs bullshit, the page on Apple‚Äôs site says ‚Äústarting September 15th‚Äù for eligibility.",Others
4335,"Plus Apple One bundles... ‚Äúoh, for just an extra ¬£10 extra a month I can get 10x the iCloud storage, Fitness+, and News+, all for the whole family‚Äù will pull a lot of people in.",Others
4336,"100% 

I couldn‚Äôt be any more of a poster-boy in terms of Peloton‚Äôs demographics. I love cycling, I miss pre-covid competitive workouts, I work out daily in my garage, and I enjoy buying expensive tech. 

The cost of the bike and the membership is still goddamn insane to me. People who bought the bike will keep the membership for years and years to justify that cost, but the cost of entry for Peloton is massive.",Others
4337,"This is my hope, I have a few cad/speed sensors on my bike and it would be nice to use those.  Unfortunately on the appletv+, I can use those but not an external HR strap as it runs out of BT capability.  Maybe with the Apple Watch/Fitness Plus that would work.  As of now, it's Zwift on the phone that pairs with lots of things.",Others
4338,Not to mention that peloton machines have GymKit enabled so I‚Äôm assuming within time they‚Äôll be able to be adaptive with Fitness+.,Others
4339,"Bingo. Chances are you‚Äôve got an iPhone. Chances are good if you‚Äôre interested in fitness and have an iPhone, you have an Apple Watch. Chances are if you have both of those you probably have subs to some of the services. Chances are therefore good that going to the top tier Apple One sub will save money *and* give access to Fitness+. Activating Apple One is a pretty low barrier to entry compared to getting a Peloton.",Others
4340,"Change your point from Peloton users to ""Peloton owners"" and I absolutely agree. Owners of the bike alone not the tread are paying about $90 a month for the bike/required bike membership cost and are absolutely not the target. There are a large amount of digital Peloton users who would be considered part of the target demographic however.",Others
4341,"Yep. I've got a watch and a Sunny brand bike. I thought about Peloton app but it was a nightmare to figure out all the hoops to get the watch broadcasting HR and my cadence sensor up there too. I'm excited to have some classes available where everything just starts nicely and works together. I don't need anything hardcore, just some guidance to keep me motivated. For $7/month now it seems like a good deal if it works like I hope it does.",Others
4342,"This right here, I own a peleton bike outright, no monthly and I would definitely consider the fitness+ subscription because the $40 monthly peleton sub is pricey. I actually just use the mobile sub right now (15) and fitness+ is still cheaper. However I dont think I can move away from the features that the peleton sub offers in regards to equipment integration. Having the watch read metrics is great and all, but the constant workout/equipment integration throughout the workout is a really good combination.",Others
4343,"Strange. I‚Äôm kind of in the opposite situation: I have a US card linked to my account, but since I don‚Äôt live there now, the app doesn‚Äôt appear on any of my devices.",Others
4344,I‚Äôm pretty sure they add new content everyday like peloton. Since they just launched they have significantly less than peloton but they could get up to their level.,Others
4345,It would be awkward without the watch connected. The trainers incorporate your data and rings into the workout. There would be a lot of times where they are just talking nonsense if you didn‚Äôt track the data. I doubt Apple wants to look that silly.,Others
4346,But you have to have an Apple Watch to download the Fitness app to do that.,Others
4347,How‚Äôs that? Fire Sticks don‚Äôt have airplay,Others
4348,"Yeah I get that now, I assumed you could just follow along the videos and using an Apple Watch to record the workout data was optional.",Others
4349,Yeah the instructors even listen to the same songs and incorporate it in the class. It feels more interactive like this.,Others
4350,"Comment, don't defend everything Apple does without reason. Tell me why they shouldn't have a toggle for personal music use? Instructors should choose your workout and workout time, styles, and even diet. Not music lol.",Others
4351,">It shouldn't require a watch at all if it wants to compete with other services in the same space.

Unless you also want to sell watches ;)",Others
4352,"Agreed. You‚Äôre already paying $10 a month for the service, don‚Äôt see why I can‚Äôt just use it to watch the exercise videos and not track my metrics.",Others
4353,Because I just use it to receive text notifications. It suits my purposes at the moment and I haven't been compelled to upgrade (until now),Others
4354,Honestly that‚Äôs exactly what I thought.,Others
4355,"Thanks for the insight.

However I think it‚Äôs far too easy for everyone to say ‚Äòjust speak to your doctor‚Äô. Like, you know what that involves right? Several weeks waiting for an appointment and then they shout at you because there‚Äôs nothing actually wrong with you, you just want to chat about potential exercise. Like, how do they even test you for that?",Others
4356,Millions!! Millions everyday!,Others
4357,Yeah why is this?? I tried to upgrade without a reset and it failed entirely...,Others
4358,"I think it's fine to sell a cheap model with low storage as long as higher tiers are available. I was excited my series 5 came with so much, it's helpful for music but I know most people don't put anything on the watch.",Others
4359,"you have to download the fitness app separately on iPad, it's not included with the update",Others
4360,Me neither.,Others
4361,"It was added in the last beta build, will most likely go live to the public later today.",Others
4362,"[This](https://youtu.be/cZnsLVArIt8) may work for you. Otherwise, just search up what exercise you want on YouTube.",Others
4363,"European here. Nope. Our fitness instructors don't have a 24/7 smile plastered on their faces. Agree, that just looks creepy. You can look pleasant and approachable without constantly grinning.",Others

4367,Could be a bug.,Others
4368,"So here's the odd thing: I bought both of the watches through my Apple account, but she's the only one getting offered the 3 months.",Others
4369,"No, I only wanted to do Fitness and don't personally care for the other services.",Others
4370,You can make the same argument about the iPhone,Others
4371,I would try it but I‚Äôm not going to buy an overly expensive Apple TV just for this,Others
4372,"Fitness app should pop up on your iPhone if you have a Watch, and for the iPad you have to manually install it from the App Store.",Others
4373,Oh completely understood - I was just shocked how wide the content gap is right now.,Others
4374,"Because if you aren‚Äôt going to shell out hundreds of dollars on Apple Watch, then you aren‚Äôt worthy.",Others
4375,"Because Apple only want to be seen offering the premier, not diluted experience. 

Same reason why they don‚Äôt sell cheap shit phone that can just about run iOS.",Others
4376,There‚Äôs A few reliable Amazon apps I think the one I use is airplaypnp or something like that and it mimics airplay and let‚Äôs your stick be found on iOS.,Others
4377,"Actually, fire sticks do have airplay. They added it recently.",Others
4378,Shoot yea I see that now. I hope that changes but likely won‚Äôt in the hopes to up the purchases of Apple TV‚Äôs.,Others
4379,I think it only shows 1 persons workout data but not sure on that. It does track everyone‚Äôs data tho in their own Apple Watch for the specific workout.,Others
4380,"You can get millions of exercise videos for free right now. These ones, link to a product, and no product equals nothing here for you.",Others
4381,A good doctor wouldn‚Äôt shout at you if you are asking if you are cleared for exercise. They want you to get healthier so they don‚Äôt have to see you die.,Others
4382,"Unless you have a preexisting health condition like a weak heart or something that‚Äôs very unlikely to happen. 

At that point if exercise is dangerous to you your doctor probably would have told you.",Others
4383,You‚Äôre more likely to be hit by a car or struck by lightning or die in a plane crash,Others
4384,It‚Äôs not fine when there‚Äôs not enough free space to update it - even with nothing installed on it,Others
4385,"Same! I did HIIT with Kim. She‚Äôs a beast and I love it! So glad they show an easier workout on the left, if you need to slow it down a bit (like me).",Others
4386,"I‚Äôm sure i can look it up, but kind elaborating on HomePod integration?",Others
4387,"Europeans in general don't ""fake"" niceness as much as Americans do",Others
4388,Oh interesting. Maybe they can get around some things if the music isn't in the session itself. Wonder how it works if you subscribe to Fitness+ but not Apple Music,Others
4389,Or a feature ;),Others
4390,"You mentioned being logged into the Fitness app on the Apple TV. Is the Apple TV logged into your account or hers? If its yours, then that would be strange not to see it on your phone as I would assume she's logged into her account on her own phone. If she's logged into the Apple TV, then I do not have any answer available to my knowledge.",Others
4391,Strange. Have you updated both your iPhone and your AppleTV? What happens if you go into your iCloud subscriptions in the Settings app on your iPhone?,Others
4392,"Hey mate, I was only getting the option for 1 month trial even though I bought a brand new Series 6, I un-paired & re-paired the watch & it worked.. Have you tried doing that yet?",Others
4393,"I actually tried that with a Wahoo trainer early this year. Transitioning my bike from ready-to-ride to sitting on the trainer was too much friction for me. I could buy another matching bike specifically for the trainer, but that would have cost about as much as buying a dedicated trainer like the Peloton. 

Zwift itself was great, but I ended up returning the Wahoo trainer and investing in more clothes for riding in cold/wet weather.",Others
4394,That was the justification for filling up my garage with powerlifting equipment. The total price of everything came out to the same as the annual gym membership that I was using five days a week.,Others
4395,"The biggest difference is that a Peloton is only used for working out and requires you to pay a subscription in order to use the device. 

iPhone with Apple Watch is still cheaper then cost of entry with Peloton and an iPhone is a much more versatile piece of equipment.",Others
4396,I don‚Äôt see the similarity at all. The iPhone is a multifunctional personal device that is necessary for a billion different daily necessities. Peloton bikes have 1 function.,Others
4397,You can do it on iPhone/iPad too.,Others
4398,"I have the fitness app, and use it too. I meant the fitness+ tab within it. Should‚Äôve calrified",Others
4399,"I know Roku did for sure, are you positive about Fire TV?",Others
4400,Do you know how the other person would join the workout?  We want to do some classes together and it would be great if we both could keep track of it at the same time.,Others
4401,"it does nothing of the sort. the other person has to start it on their watch manually, and it doesn't show up as a fitness+ workout.",Others
4402,I was exaggerating. But generally you just don‚Äôt go to the doctor unless you have a specific issue.,Others
4403,"No, fitness + will kill you if you push yourself, almost guaranteed.",Others
4404,"I can‚Äôt find the fitness app in the App Store for the life of me.  And then when it did finally show up, it wouldn‚Äôt let me download because it said features weren‚Äôt supported on my device...  2019 iPad Pro, in the US, on 14.3...",Others
4405,"i think App Store, but the update hasn't finished on my iPad so i can't say for sure yet",Others
4406,It automatically installs with tvOS 14.3,Others

4409,2. They‚Äôre great for hanging clothes on.,Others
4410,Did you upgrade to iOS 14.3?,Others
4411,TIL! Can you airplay it to an Apple TV after you start it without the watch?,Others
4412,"I stand corrected, it‚Äôs certainly dumb to make it a disjointed offering like that.",Others
4413,Oh you are right. I confused the two. Sorry about that.,Others
4414,Euthanasia+ for a low low price included in Apple one lol,Others
4415,I just installed 14.3 on my phone and apple tv. Still no sign of it.,Others
4416,I have my Apple TV playing through my HomePod right now and I don‚Äôt have the 4K version. It‚Äôs the ATV 4th gen I believe.,Others
4417,"If you start a Fitness+ workout on your iPhone, what options does it offer?",Others
4418,"I haven‚Äôt tried, but I heard that‚Äôs a no go. 

Some claimed they could if they were already connected to airplay before starting the workout, but nobody showed any proof ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Others
4419,"On the Ô£ø TV it‚Äôs a separate app, and on the phone it‚Äôs part of the Fitness app",Others
4420,"Just got off the phone with Apple. Supposedly, since I ordered my watch right when it became available, I'm passed the 90 day offer... I ordered my girlfriend's watch 10 days later.
Isn't that some shit.",Others
4421,"No, we have separate, unlinked accounts.",Others
4422,Hm. I see it on Apple TV now but my iPhone app doesn't show fitness +.,Others
4423,"Hey!that just made my day hahaha, cheers!!!",Others
4424,This must be wrong! They explicitly said it was available for devices when preordering. You even even find stuff online.,Others
4425,That would definitely be some shit. Sorry broski.,Others
4426,"Oh, I misunderstood. I was only offered 1 month free as well. Fwiw, I subscribe to AppleOne and plan on upgrading to the premiere plan after the free trial ends.",Others
4427,That's what the woman from Apple Support told me over the phone. I'm so frustrated.,Others
4428,"It wasn't showing up for me because I didn't have a Watch 3 or higher. Just got a Watch 6, now it shows up.",Others

https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/three-month-fitness-plus-trial-broken/",Others
4430,Do you have photos of the cases on the watch?,Others
4431,Thank you for doing this. I‚Äôve been looking at cases and I‚Äôm having trouble picking one bc of fake reviews on Amazon and limited reviews on manufacturer sites. I‚Äôm really trying to avoid cases that might scratch the watch body due to dust etc.,Others
4432,does the otterbox block the speakers?,Others
4433,"I‚Äôve seen in reviews that some cases scratch together with dust. I wonder how to prevent that. I would expect the case should be really tight in the first place to avoid dust getting in. Then, what the user could do is to remove the case frequently and clean. I have not had scratches on my watches with any case but I typically wear them for a limited time and then use band only. I put the case on only during some activities for some hours, max a day.",Others
4434,"I love my speigen thin fit. Doesn‚Äôt take from the shape of the watch, almost no added bulk, and has taken two nice hits this week no issues.

I‚Äôm also running a screen protector. Both have Been great.",Others
4435,Hello so you have a thin film protector on the watch and with the cases with built in screen protector over it?,Others
4436,"I use the Spigen and a couple others (can‚Äôt remember the brands) they‚Äôve all been ok for my needs which is daily wear
With little threat of immediate danger. Spigen is pretty easy to put on my series 7 (44mm case on packaging).",Others
4437,"Here‚Äôs the otterbox one on the s7 45: 
https://imgur.com/a/62zps7y",Others
4438,"Yep, nearly had a heart attack when I saw my watch was scratched with the half body case. It‚Äôs only been a week with the otterbox but I think it‚Äôs probably the best one. Having said that though, the availability of cases for the watch is‚Ä¶ average at best. Every case has some issues in some way which is a bit disappointing",Others
4439,Nope cutouts are almost perfect.,Others
4440,"Yeah, as mentioned in my other reply the availability of cases for the watch isn‚Äôt that great. 

Dust, scratches, touch sensitivity‚Ä¶ they all have faults. I mean if my watch is going to get scratched with a case on it - might as well go naked and let it free. But just for a peace of mind‚Äôs sake I wanted a case and so far the otterbox seems to be the only reasonable one. 

It‚Äôs tight enough so particles or dust won‚Äôt get in but when I use a planer or a saw, very fine dust does get in so I use a micro fibre cloth or wet wipes and give it a wipe and I‚Äôm good to go.",Others
4441,"Yep, that way even when I use a case with built in screen cover dust or particles that get stuck under the case wont scratch my display as easily. And if you use a case without a screen cover you still have some protection",Others
4442,Definitely bulky but looks like it‚Äôs perfect to protect your watch while you work! Do you only use the case while you‚Äôre working?,Others
4443,wouldnt that be too tight? I also thought of this but im scared it might be too tight and scratch the body,Others
4444,Yep only for work. Gotta show off the watch when I‚Äôm going out haha,Others
4445,"Nope, if you use the tempered glass then it‚Äôll definitely get in the way. That‚Äôs why with the film it‚Äôs a minimal difference and won‚Äôt cause any issues with the fit.",Others
4446,Would only expect significant updates for another year or two max. Look up the watch faces to make sure it has some you like/the workout functionality is still decent. Overall I would find it hard to recommend the 3 over the SE though.,Others
4447,"it'll certainly see at least watchOS 9 and probably 10 if apple does what everyone expects and finally discontinues producing and selling them this fall.

it's still a decent fitness-centric watch for the $120ish it's commonly on sale for, but the limited storage space (less than 2GB for music and such) and aging processor means it's not going to feel all that snappy these days.

and yeah, OS updates were a complete pain in the ass and often require wiping the watch completely to install due to 'insufficient storage space', but apple claims that this is less common of an issue with watchOS 8 and future updates (i still see complaints on this subreddit whenever there's a new update, but they don't seem near as frequent as before)",Others
4448,"It should‚Äôve been discontinued in 2020. No one including experts in the tech media can fathom why Apple has kept it around, specially because Apple has simultaneously almost made it impossible to update watchOS on. Going into 2022 save up a little bit more money and at the very minimum you should be looking at an SE, or Series 5 or later. Do not buy the Series 3 it is effectively an already discontinued product.",Others
4449,"Keep an eye out for a used Series 5 or 6 or an SE.  they all have bigger better screens, more features and better lifespan than a Series 3.  Plus, updates are a pain in the arse for series 3‚Äôs.",Others
4450,I‚Äôd be really surprised if the Series 3 gets watchOS 9. I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if they lower the SE down to $249 and discontinue the 3. Just a guess though.,Others
4451,"Got mine on Boxing Day 2021 a month later major cracks in the screen, I updated my phone to iOS 15 it automatically updates my watch to watch os 8.4 and everything is super slow and laggy. Honestly don‚Äôt get one.  I bought it new from Apple store. Im gonna see if they‚Äôll take it back because it‚Äôs honestly so bad. Maybe mines a dud idk. I also had a series 0 years ago and it lasted three years no scratches only stopped using it when the screen popped off because the battery expanded. I‚Äôve also found out recently that the series 3 still have the screen poppin issue.",Others
4452,"But when the watch stops being supported, doesn't it also become incompatible with your iPhone? (Sorry, I know I'm probably wrong, I don't know much about Apple Watches...)",Others
