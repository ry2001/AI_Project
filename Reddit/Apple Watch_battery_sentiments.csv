0,"I‚Äôm debating on canceling my preorder after seeing these reviews. I‚Äôd be upgrading from a day one Series 4 with 80% battery health. 

I mainly upgraded so that I can have a good battery life again, get AOD and blood oxygen sensor. 

I‚Äôm seriously thinking of just getting a battery replacement and call it a year. It also doesn‚Äôt help that if I want a black Watch I have to go SS.",battery,positive
1,Did I miss an incredibly small one-liner or did he not even address battery life?,battery,negative
2,What‚Äôs the battery health on your S4?,battery,negative
3,"I‚Äôm totally happy with the physical design of it, but there‚Äôs nothing this year that makes it a worthwhile upgrade. For me, the two biggest things that I‚Äôd be excited for are either a significant upgrade to battery life, or some new health-tracking features enabled by new hardware. Anything else is kinda ‚Äúwell I guess a slightly larger screen is nice but not $400 nice‚Äù.",battery,positive
4,"I had a steel Series 4 with 75% battery health, and right after the Series 7 was announced I was on the phone with Apple to get a battery replacement.

Now I‚Äôve got a Series 4 with a fresh battery that looks brand new (so shiny without all the scratches!) and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my decision.

I‚Äôll probably upgrade next year if the Series 8 gets those rumoured new health sensors. AOD would be cool too.",battery,positive
5,"Fair play. I went from S1 to S4 and it was a big jump, but every year since has been underwhelming. 

Not that I know what I want from a smart watch these days. Maybe just battery, everything is fine.",battery,positive
6,"He did address battery life, it‚Äôs the same.",battery,negative
7,He mentions battery life in the video.,battery,negative
8,"he addressed on battery and recharge 

while battery life is the same. quick charge fits his life style much better",battery,negative
9,"there's not anything new there really. battery life is the same as it's always been ('fine' to 'mediocre' depending on how you use the Watch), but it charges faster so you can just do a quick charge at night or in the morning if you find some benefit to sleep tracking and be fine.",battery,positive
10,Did they replace the screen too when you got the battery replaced or have you just taken really good care of yours? I'm debating cancelling my order but the scratch in my series 4 has been bothering me for a couple years now and going to the sapphire glass would be nice.,battery,negative
11,On your Apple Watch go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health.,battery,negative
12,"I‚Äôm actually kind of tired of the non-fitness people lamenting how useless the updates are. I trail run, hike, and road run, among other things, and the pulse oximeter and always-on altimeter is very nice to have, as well as the added battery life on outdoor runs. NONE of them seem to be mentioning these kinds of use-cases.",battery,negative
13,"I have a Garmin 735XT and you post is making me rethink the SE purchase. I used to swim often and I will be getting back into it. Ultimately, My garmin's battery is dying way too fast after 3 years of use and my girl just got the SE. It seems like the watch just works better and uses the data with more of a purpose. The Garmin brings data into the phone but then things easily fall out of sync. I am on the fence for sure..",battery,positive
14,"Same here! I can't wait.  


I rode out my S1 down to the point where the battery bulged and popped the screen off.",battery,negative
15,Same! I was waiting for a sign and a couple of months ago my battery popped the screen of my S1 out. So I‚Äôve been holding out for the 7.,battery,negative
16,I have a 5 as well. Zero reason to upgrade before new health sensors or better battery imo.,battery,positive
17,"Same cycle here too. Nothing wrong with the 4 by itself, but the battery on mine has gotten pretty terrible which has been the primary motivator. It‚Äôs 3 years old; to me, might as well upgrade rather than spend money on it replacing the battery. I also kind of figure that with the 7 technically being a complete case redesign (even though it largely looks the same) we aren‚Äôt going to see some wild redesign next year; Apple will probably want to use the new design for at least 2-3 years. Doesn‚Äôt really give me reason to wait another year.",battery,positive
18,The screen size from 4 to 5 is the same right? I could understand upgrading from a 4 because by then the battery is degrading and the watch is probably a little slow due to bulky WatchOS upgrades,battery,negative
19,I‚Äôd agree but my ss5 battery has had it. I‚Äôm still thinking of a reduced price 6!,battery,negative
20,The 7 still looks the same though? I'm on the same cycle but see no reason to upgrade from 4 yet. Totally expect next years model to take the iphone route (hard edges) so I'll probably wait for that. Totally get upgrading because of the battery though!,battery,negative
21,How much does it cost to change the battery in an Apple Watch?,battery,negative
22,"> Nothing wrong with the 4 by itself, but the battery on mine has gotten pretty terrible which has been the primary motivator.

I'm in the same boat. I'm not sure I'd call the battery terrible on mine but it's bad enough that I've started to notice.

So it sounds like people aren't saying *not* to upgrade to the 7, which is nice.",battery,negative
23,"I also have a 4. The battery is at 81% which is making me think about upgrading to the 7.  While I love my 4 in the black steel, I may stick to aluminum this time.",battery,positive
24,"I‚Äôm sure it depends on usage too. Mine is around 75% health and occasionally it dies by mid afternoon, although recently it‚Äôs been a tad better, but it almost never makes the whole day anymore. Sounds like the 7 probably isn‚Äôt worthwhile if you have a 6 and maybe even a 5, but I feel like it could probably go either way with the 4. Since my battery isn‚Äôt so hot anymore it makes it more worth it for me.",battery,positive
25,"I have a four decided to just get the battery replaced. Until there is a big battery boost or something big hardware wise, the 4 still does everything I need it to.",battery,positive
26,"I expect the 8 to have a new sensor and, if rumors pan out, the first watch to improve on the ‚Äúall day‚Äù battery life. If so, I might upgrade again and hold that for 2-3 versions.",battery,negative
27,"Before the X I had a 7+, even after I replaced the screen+battery that phone was flawless and plenty fast when I gave it away. I got the 12 because it was essentially only $70 to upgrade with T-Mobile‚Äôs promo, and I was going to pay that to replace the battery.

I‚Äôll probably get the 13PM because of the better battery and higher storage. Then that‚Äôll be my forever phone.",battery,positive
28,"if you get the battery replaced, its basically a new watch and your resell is higher. Its basically worth about as much as a new SE now

so if you sold it you'd be able to buy a series 7 cheaper",battery,negative
29,Maybe my s3 can Last till the series 7. It‚Äôs got 84% battery,battery,negative
30,"He praises it for good, all day battery life but explains how he has to charge it twice a day. Doesn't sound like all day battery life to me.",battery,negative
31,Battery life has been awful on my series 6 vs 5 ending my day with 40% instead of 70-80% same use,battery,negative
32,Hope do you check Apple Watch battery health?,battery,negative
33,"he's not charging it to 100% either time, though, just giving it quick partial charges

(i still think battery life could be better, especially as someone who only ever uses their Watch for fitness tracking and so am comparing it to Garmins, but it can easily surpass the 18 hours of regular use Apple claims for a full charge)",battery,positive
34,"I‚Äôve never had battery issues with watch, just throw it on the charger at night. Or if you forget, charge it for an hour in the morning while getting ready",battery,negative
35,Is the hand washing detection on? I have heard that leaving it on can be a major battery drain for some users.,battery,negative
36,What were you planning to do with the missing 30% battery at the end of the day?,battery,negative
37,"On the watch: Settings-Battery-Battery Health. 
Same as on the iphone. 
My Series 3 is still on 89%",battery,negative
38,"That's what I do since I sleep with it. I charge about an hour after work and about an hour before I leave in the morning, the batteries always between 40% and 90% charge. I'd consider that all day because if I forget to charge after work it'll make it through the night and I'll wake up the next morning at like 25% to 30% (which can make it the full day if I turn off radios and notification mirroring and just use it as a ""dumb"" watch)",battery,negative
39,Bingo,battery,negative
40,What? I actually take care of my watch and it‚Äôs at 84% ü§î it‚Äôs not even launch day,battery,negative
41,"Yeah I don't know why people complain about the battery. I wear mine all day, I use heart rate a lot. I get a bunch of notifications. I text on it a lot. Mine usually goes down by 50% or less for my entire day. I have been wearing it for 3 hours and it only went down 1%",battery,negative
42,"2 weeks with my S5 44m LTE and the need to charge every night is still there.

I turned off Always On feature last night after I fully-charged it before 12mn and now it‚Äôs 6:22 PM and it‚Äôs only 53% battery remaining.",battery,negative
43,"Same here. First time smart watch buyer, battery has been great (I charge at night). Normally finish around 16 hours with around half charge remaining.

Slack notifications all day, checking activity, workouts, flashlight, whatever.",battery,positive
44,"I just picked up the SE as I can't justify the significant extra cost for O2 sensor that shows questionable results, an always-on screen (don't need to have the screen on when I'm not looking at my watch), and a U1 chip that currently has zero value.  The watch is a nice upgrade from my series 3.  Still won't replace my Garmin Fenix 5S for serious hikes (6+ hours) as activity tracking for that long crushes the battery.",battery,negative
45,"For me an Apple Watch is a no-no because of the battery life of 18h and a slow charging. Most of the time you cannot bring it to sleep cause you forget to charge it, so you miss the sleep analysis. I would rather have a less fancy watch with 5-7 days battery life like a garmin or a fitbit smartwatch. I hope Apple manages to make the next watch with at least 3 days battery life, because the looks and the OS is way nicer, but until then I will have to wait.",battery,negative
46,"I really do want an Apple Watch because of all the bells and whistles the OS offers, but the Versa lineup‚Äôs 6 day battery life and Alexa-button are just too good to pass up for me. Still really cool to see how far the Apple Watch has come!",battery,positive
47,"I‚Äôm skeptical.  I was on Apple Watch from the jump but I have not upgraded yearly.  I purposely went Stainless because of the sapphire, but the aging experience with these devices has been miserable.

I kept the Series 0 for two years, then upgraded to a used Series 3 in great condition.  Both have been bad experiences after year one.  Glitchy OS, weird Siri failures, communication issues with phone, plus physical failings like glass coming apart and battery problems with the Series 0.",battery,negative
48,If only the battery would last for days that would be great.,battery,positive
49,Is the battery different to compensate for the always on display?,battery,negative
50,But wouldn‚Äôt that feature drain your battery much fast?,battery,negative
51,Most people I know with an Apple Watch turned the always on display off after a couple days. It‚Äôs a huge drain on battery life for not much gained in efficiency or performance,battery,negative
52,"Always on, wasting your battery. I have a 4, which doesn‚Äôt have that, when you look at it, it turns on, instantly. I‚Äôve never thought ‚Äúman, i want always on.‚Äù Ever.",battery,negative
53,"I get that but if your worried about money, as I assume someone buying the cheapest option would be, than not having an always on display only saves you money by making the battery have a longer lifespan. That‚Äôs already the biggest problem with smart watches. Real watches last longer and hold there value much better.",battery,positive
54,"Battery on Apple Watch is so bad that even if the fall feature is 100% effective, you can only use it 50% of the time.",battery,negative
55,"100% same reason I‚Äôm not switching from my Garmin Fenix 5S anytime soon either. 

I need at least a week of battery life out of the Apple Watch before I‚Äôd consider it a daily wear.",battery,negative
56,"I‚Äôm considering an Apple Watch to replace my old Fitbit, sure the battery on the fit bit lasts a few days, but the lack of having a regular routine to charge it, means I often forget about it and leave it on charge for a couple of days...",battery,negative
57,Current getting 2 days worth of battery on the SE,battery,negative
58,"Yeah, I'm shocked at how much better the battery life is.nyoud think Apple would have figured out a way to incorporate a battery that isn't trash.",battery,negative
59,Yeah this is my big hang up. I‚Äôd buy this in an instant if it had 2+ day battery life. 18 hours is simply not enough.,battery,negative
60,"I'm guessing it's also got a smaller battery? Even without always on screen it lasts 1.5 days, same with the S6.",battery,negative
61,"There could be different chip binning, missing chip features and a cheaper battery. A tear down will tell us the truth but it‚Äôs all speculation now.",battery,negative
62,"Kind of like Tesla vehicles.  Everything is there under the $30k car, you just need to spend $10,000 more to unlock the battery in order to go 100 miles more.",battery,negative
63,The SE has a smaller battery but still has comparable battery life as a result. I got an SE (my first full smartwatch) and the quarter second it takes the screen to come on is barely noticeable.,battery,negative
64,"Functionality wise? Sure. But anesthetics are a major reason smartwatches finally took off. Sadly, a lot of people couldn't care less about 2 weeks battery on a watch if the screen looks as unappealing as a sticker.",battery,negative
65,It was a few years old and battery life was not as good as when it was new.  The new watch has a bigger screen and access to the new watch faces with more complications.  Plus the always-on altimeter and sleep tracking are a nice bonus.,battery,positive
66,"So I have a couple questions if you could help me :-)

I made a dumb dumb call and recently bought a Samsung smart watch but am an iPhone user. I love the watch but compatibility issues are killing me, so I‚Äôm potentially looking to swap to an Apple Watch. 

-How‚Äôs the battery life? I would say I‚Äôm generally an active-ish user. One of the reasons i had gone Samsung was because of its 2 day life. The sub-24 hour life on the Apple is stressing me out a bit. If I went hiking all day, would it die?

-How long does it take to charge? 

-How‚Äôs the sleep tracking? I used to have a Fitbit that had awesome sleep tracking. The Samsung really sucks for it.",battery,negative
67,How‚Äôs the battery?,battery,negative
68,"I have the series 6 and its very close to 2 days battery life, typically I end up with 65% charge at the end of the day. If you charge it while in the shower daily you should be fine.",battery,negative
69,Best? I dont know. Got an 4000‚Ç¨ mbp which underperforms with hardware (only 4 hours of battery and heat/throttling issues) and software issues (crashes and countless bugs).,battery,positive
70,My 5 lasted me 1 day and had around 20% when I went to bed. And when one of the features is sleep tracking it would be nice to at least be able to get a few days battery life. Charging overnight is it hard? No. Is it annoying? Yes.,battery,negative
71,I use mine a normal amount with a 30 minute tracked workout and I finish the day on 65% battery. 18 hours would be if you have the 4g version and spend the whole day streaming music without your phone.,battery,negative
72,"That isn‚Äôt the case for the battery in the majority of Teslas. The FSD hardware works this way though, although arguably the software behind it is worth more than the hardware.",battery,negative
73,"Standard vs Long range on the model 3 are definitely different battery packs. It's a 50% increase. They might have the same pack shape for manufacturing simplicity but there's no way it's sitting on that much extra range without being paid for. The upgrades are full self driving and a soft lock on some 0-60 performance for the AWD non performance models. That software lock does NOT get it all the way up to the performance model, it only unlocks residual performance from the motors. The rear motor is >200hp on its own (though the torque is software restricted at low speed to avoid torque ripple effects), but adding the (more powerful, no ripple effects) front motor only brings it up to about 350hp. The $2k power bump unlocks the missing chunk given the limitations of the long range model as is, and the actual Performance model has some additional stuff (though the motors are, at their core, the same) to provide the last bit of performance, my guess would be some improved materials to keep up reliability with all the extra torque.

There was one point in time where the model S was selling 70kwh models that actually had 80kwh batteries, but that was for two reasons: They'd stopped making the 70kwh battery pack, and restricting the 80kwh battery to 70kwh usable actually improved usable life (and it wasn't NEARLY as big a jump as the current model 3 standard->long range models). It's why they suggest not charging your car all the way unless you're going on a long trip, which will give you another half hour of driving before you need to stop.",battery,negative
74,"I have the Garmin Instinct Solar and AW SE. I find the AW to be much more accurate and consistent when not using the GPS e.g. calories burned (activities), steps and distance. The only time I really care to use the Instinct Solar is long distance endurance activities and I need the extra battery life (mostly running)... I have a Garmin Edge for biking... ultimately I think I'm going to sell the Instinct Solar as I mostly wear a watch to track fitness, overall well being, and health... the AW is excellent for this.",battery,positive
75,"Just so you know, you can do most of these things with a Fitbit or something similar. Less features (but can still deal with notifications and everything), much better battery life and way cheaper. Charge 3 is like ¬£80 in Currys I think",battery,positive
76,My s6 ends up at 65% charge at the end of the day,battery,negative
77,"I was just going to say, the screen being illuminated, even at 1fps, would still be illuminated and draw a lot from the battery regardless. These OLED screens are pretty good though, so as long as most of the screen is black, those pixels aren‚Äôt illuminated, and won‚Äôt draw so much power",battery,positive
78,I had a Fitbit before I got my Apple Watch. I loved it! They have such a great battery life. I wish Apple could somehow have theirs that good. Between Apple Watch and Fitbit I definitely think the Apple Watch is worth the extra money though. It can do so much and I think it looks nice on,battery,positive
79,"That's really good. My last Apple Watch was the 3, and the battery could barely last a full 24 hours. Good to hear it's improved a lot.",battery,positive
80,"I mean, I‚Äôm just assuming for me that since Apple says it‚Äôs the same 18 hour battery life as the series 5 that I‚Äôll roughly end up with the same amount left at the end of the day. If I could go 1 work day then through the night and wake up with like 20% left I‚Äôd be ok probably. I would love to have 2-3 days like the previous galaxy watch.",battery,positive
81,Have a S5 and use Autosleep. My cycle is charging in the morning around 5am for 20min while I get ready for work. Have about 65% at 6pm after work. Get home and throw it back on charger while I shower and sleep with it. Usually have 90% when I wake up.,battery,negative
82,The problem imo with a 2-3 day battery is you don't have a consistent charge routine so it always ends up going flat on you at random times. I had a pebble with a 10 day battery and it would go flat on me in the middle of the day. With my apple watch it has never gone flat on me because I charge it at the same time every day.,battery,negative
83,Shit a 10 day battery life you could literally charge it one time a week. That would be awesome. If I could text from the galaxy watch while using my iPhone I would get one. Either way it‚Äôs not a big deal if I have a watch or not so I‚Äôll just wait for the right one,battery,negative
84,"Newer chips will be far more power efficient. The way they generally improve chips has the effect of both increasing computation and saving energy. In very simple terms, if you can complete a task quicker you can use less energy doing it and improve the battery life.",battery,positive
85,The battery life hasn‚Äôt improved though.,battery,negative
86,I think they reached the good enough stage with the s3. I have a s5 and this point I just want a multi-day battery life. Nobody is running out there playing fortnite on their watch.,battery,positive
87,"If they could just get three days or more of battery life out of it, I would get one. But I‚Äôm not charging daily. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still using MiBands. Once they up that battery life, I‚Äôd be willing to spend the money.",battery,negative
88,"Faster is better, but the watch was hardly slow before. I‚Äôd rather see two or three day battery life. The 18 hour life of an Apple Watch is one of the biggest frustrations, aside from the lack of 3rd party faces.",battery,negative
89,*cries in 10 day battery life of the Pebble Time Steel*,battery,negative
90,Apple needs to work on battery life. Other watches at this point can get multiple days to a week but apple is still stuck at basically a day and a half,battery,negative
91,"Yeah I also used it for swimming workouts before without issues. But when I was in the water it kept trying to call emergency services. When I tried turning it off it kept turning back on again so it was like the buttons were stuck. Eventually the battery died. I cleaned the scroll wheel and the side button but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt help and when I took it off the charger, after 2-5min the battery was down to like 5%.",battery,negative
92,">	I was gonna get a 7 but realized it‚Äôs faster sure but like‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a watch

Yeah that‚Äôs the reason why I just wanna buy a 3 and just be happy with it. Btw, how‚Äôs the battery?",battery,positive
93,"Haven't used mine in weeks. It was cool, in the first month, then I found myself using it without battery and realized I don't really need it.",battery,negative
94,"I sold mine. 

Bought the S0 on release day and gave it back to Apple.

Tried again with a S3 LTE on release day as well.
It was pretty nice. I could go to the gym without my phone, just the watch and AirPods. The issue was battery and speed. So often it would hang, so often the battery wouldn‚Äôt allow me my full routine at the gym. But it was still pretty nice.

I‚Äôve enjoyed it for one year, then as soon as I stopped going to the gym, I had zero use for it.  

You have to cater a lot to your watch. And it‚Äôs slow to do pretty much anything IMO. I know the latest series are faster, but can‚Äôt really speak about that.",battery,positive
95,"I have been using my GPS Series 3 since launch every day, I use it when running and lifting to track my workouts and it also gets everyday use for not getting my phone out to control music/see texts/ whatsapp/ weather/etc.
Battery life is still good I use it to track workouts for over an hour and a half each day, half of them with GPS, and I still get over 50% battery before charging every night.
So in my case, totally worth it and one of the best Apple products I have owned.",battery,positive
96,"I had every Apple Watch up to and including series 4. Decided it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted from a watch. Charging it every single day was a hassle, always wondering why my battery life was shit, Siri being unresponsive, AirPods sometimes pairing to phone instead of watch and vise Versa. Ended up getting a Garmin instead. 2 week battery life, heart rate monitor, GPS. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back.",battery,negative
97,"I had an original Apple Watch and honestly disliked it. The battery didn‚Äôt cut it, the apps were basic, but, most of all, I hated how it caused me to look at my watch when a notification came in and distract me from my conversations. I worked at the time with many Apple Watch owners, and it was a constant bad feeling when someone would look at their watch during a conversation, as if they had something better to do.

I know the tech has improved, but I went back to an analog watch, and I love it. No one compliments you for a smart watch, anyway.",battery,positive
98,No battery life sucks so hard and I wish the face was round,battery,negative
99,The Apple Watch is one of the worst for sports because it has the shortest battery life of any sports watch.,battery,negative
100,"I find it one of the nicest, most impressive bits of Apple tech, but not ‚Äòessential‚Äô.

If you consider it like an iPhone ‚Äònano‚Äô with shitty battery life it‚Äôs fantastic. iMessage voice to text is incredible, Apple Pay, run tracking whilst listening to podcasts, etc... I can often just leave phone at home if not out all day.",battery,positive
101,"I absolutely hate the fact that battery replacements out of warranty are prohibitively expensive. 
I got a cheap Garmin Forerunner just for GPS and heart-rate tracking. I can‚Äôt replace the battery there either, but at least it‚Äôs only 80 bucks instead of 300.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying 80 bucks every three years - but not over 200. That‚Äôs insane.",battery,negative
102,"The embarrassing battery life of Apple Watch will never make me consider it. I am surprised to read how many people see Apple Watch as a game changer because it counts steps, measures your heartbeat and tracks your workout. So many other products were doing it already before it and much better. 
I own a fitness tracker - light and with 8 days battery. I personally don‚Äôt see the reason for smart watches as a product category to exist (my iPhone is great as it is) and I won‚Äôt ever consider Apple Watch until it matches Fitbit‚Äôs sleep tracking quality and battery life and Garmin‚Äôs fitness tracking accuracy.",battery,positive
103,How‚Äôs the battery in yours? In the last two months my S2 battery has gone to complete shit. That‚Äôs even after repairing as well,battery,negative
104,"The old ones are dirt cheap, series 3 and are totally fine. I get a full day of battery with them and they are functionally totally useful. 


I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd recommend the current gen to anyone as long as much better deals are floating around.  This may change if new models get 4 day battery life or sleep tracking or some kind of killer app.",battery,negative
105,"I‚Äôll grant you on battery but:

-	I don‚Äôt need it to be cheaper
-	I didn‚Äôt say I **only** use it as a tracker - I use some of the features like timers and music which are easier to use on a full blown smartwatch
-	I don‚Äôt need it to be lighter, I don‚Äôt notice the Watch is on my wrist most of the time",battery,positive
106,"I have a cellular S3, and I can confirm it is nice to be able to leave my phone at home, or because my 6s+ battery was crap, I could leave my phone in my truck to charge while out and about, and still be able to stay connected.

107,Ok. We‚Äôll see when my Forerunner‚Äòs battery is dead.,battery,negative

111,"I think there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll say the difference in screen size isn‚Äôt as noticeable as the marketing makes it seem.

I‚Äôm upgrading from a 5 because the battery is struggling a bit to get me through a day, so no real regrets either way, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big leap this year.",battery,negative
112,Fingers crossed it‚Äôs better than my series 4 that only charges to 75% and dies within a few hours.,battery,negative
113,"I‚Äôm also on the 5 and considering a 7 for the same reason, but I‚Äôm kind of anticipating battery life to decrease this year, though. The series 7 will have a larger, brighter, higher res screen, the same processor as last year, and almost the same overall size, which to me points to:

-	Battery size will likely not be able to increase to any significant degree
-	same processor driving a more powerful display means likely an efficiency loss.",battery,positive
114,Turning off walkie-talkie mode saved me like 20% by the end of the day. Before the watch would just die in about 10ish hours. I‚Äôm at 81% battery health now though,battery,negative

117,"If it's like most Android Wear watches, the display will frequently activate and destroy the battery. I hope it's not",battery,negative
118,My series 6 lasts 2 days and at the end of exactly 2 days since last charge it‚Äôs at about 10% or under and at the end of one full day it‚Äôs at 60% so the series 7 is quite an upgrade in battery life,battery,negative
119,"Agreed. Though in my case, my results were for my first FULL day, not ‚Äúthe day I got it and tested everything I could‚Äù. Regardless, I‚Äôm very happy with both results and since I‚Äôm used to not having always on display, I may keep it off just to boost battery.",battery,positive
120,"The battery just sucks in Apple Watch for me. Not sure why Apple can‚Äôt incorporate the sport training aspect Garmin has. Maybe it‚Äôs a reliability thing? Is Garmin‚Äôs data even accurate or are the numbers on their Watch just fluff? Like body battery, heart rate, or any metric it measures? Then again, how accurate is apples in a lab setting? We are all wearing these devices to get these data points but can the data gathered actually stand up to lab tests?

Small update but I just got the watch, think it was 70% charged when turning it on. Have done couple hour long workouts and never plugged in and still at 12 days of battery. Apple get on this level.",battery,negative
121,I really like having Body Battery and find that it is a very useful training tool. I check my morning HRV using other apps already but I‚Äôve noticed certain behaviors which reduce HRV and sap my battery. I also use Stryd for running and train by power rather than pace. The major benefit of the F√©nix over the Apple Watch for me is the battery life and sleep metrics.,battery,positive

I use mine a lot for the Home app and flashlight and mainly it lets you see if a notification is dumb or actually worth taking your phone out.

151,"During the first week I was actually scared my unit was defective or something. I would end most days at 20-30%, and started thinking the always-on-display was the culprit.

Then after a week it magically got sorted out. Now most days I finish above 50% battery, even when doing workouts and using the watch normally. I think the combination of a) a lot of apps being installed from your phone b) indexing and c) watchOS 6.0 just made the watch stress too much. Letting indexing finish and updating to the latest patch fixed everything for me.",battery,negative
152,"Are you telling the watch to track your exercise at all?  The biggest drain for me happens on days where it is monitoring my activity.

For example, I started an outdoor walk this morning and walked 2+ miles.  At the end, my battery had dropped 13% in the span of 40 minutes due to measuring my heart and using the GPS.   At 8AM I was already down to 85%.  Had I not done any activity I would generally leave the house at nearly 100%.

The Series 5 appears to have a better battery than the series 4 to help with this, but on days where I'm doing 1-2 hours of exercise I see myself ending the day around 25% on my S5 where I would have been around 40% on my S3.",battery,negative
153,"(Note: I haven't watched the review yet).  I wonder if this review was done on watchOS 6.0.0.  I heard multiple reports from early adopters that the battery life during the first week was abysmal, and it might have been due to some bug in the day one software.

I haven't had _any_ issues with battery life on my Series 5.  One day I logged around 4 hours of workouts, and still ended the day at 30%.  Most days I end above 50%.",battery,negative

It‚Äôs not hard to turn the AOD off so it‚Äôs not something that is a deal breaker. I‚Äôm coming from a Galaxy Watch and while I like the Apple Watch more, the battery life on the Samsung is excellent.

It should not surprise anyone that there is a real difference when you turn off the AOD. No matter how advanced LTPO may or may not be, you're still powering on a display all day. And Apple's AOD watchfaces are in color with lots of detail unlike other smartwatches AODs that do a crippled ambient mode.

It‚Äôs currently 9:30pm and I‚Äôm at 65 percent. I‚Äôm on watchOS 6.0 and I leave my watch charged overnight. It‚Äôs not bad in my opinion but I‚Äôve been hearing I could‚Äôve been on the same carrier but with series 3 for much cheaper, I don‚Äôt even use the always on display really. Still a good first watch imo.",battery,negative
229,"I dunno If I should get the series 4 or 5.
In my country the s4 retails for $500 and series 5 is $630, that's a $130 difference, both 44mm GPS only.
AOD is mildly important to me, but battery life is a must, which one is best in your opinion?",battery,positive
230,Good time to get the S4 if the price drops. My colleague has one and has 4 days of battery.,battery,negative
231,"S5 has been much better than my S2 or S3 (can‚Äôt remember which one I had briefly). 

The battery is terrible though. That‚Äôs really my only complaint. The bigger screen and smaller bezels make such a difference for me. 

Actually one more small complaint. I do wish Apple would give 3rd party apps some creative control over watch faces. But it‚Äôs a fine line to walk. If you‚Äôve ever owned an android and android watch.. then you know what an absolute mess it is trying to find a decent watch face in the play store. 

They advertise this cool face, but if you want weather, paywall, color options, paywall , etc etc . It‚Äôs a mess. It‚Äôs the Call of Duty of app stores. Micro transaction greed",battery,negative
232,I went from S4 to S5 and loving every minute of it. AOD is a game changer for my work use. Battery life has been amazing. I finish the day with 60-70%,battery,positive
233,"AOD is cool, but just as cellular was a major battery drain on the S3, so it was better to wait for the S4, I think this first iteration is worth skipping unless you upgrade every year.
No matter the refresh rate, it's still powering many LEDs all day.",battery,positive
234,"Everything he said about s5 was true, for the first few days. With updates, my watch has gotten significantly better. The other day I ended the day with 50% no disabled apps. It‚Äôs very hot or miss. 

The only issue I have and I have suggested this to Apple is to make the display turn off completely in complete darkness. I don‚Äôt need the the display always on when it‚Äôs covered by my sleeve or at night while I‚Äôm in bed. 

Another thing is, I use my watch all the time. The only time it‚Äôs off my wrist is when I shower. I keep it on all the time even when sleeping and I have 0 issues with the battery.",battery,negative

If you are taking calls or want texts away from your phone then LTE is worth it, otherwise GPS does everything you‚Äôd need normally imo.

This includes a work out a day as well.",battery,positive

248,Do you have raise to wake on? With the always on display I turned that feature off and have found battery life to be much better that way. It‚Äôs also helpful to use less complications on the face you use wherever possible.,battery,positive
249,"My Nike series 5 has been ending the day off with ~40% from moderately heavy use 7 am through midnight-ish. I have AOD and ambient noise monitoring all on and I‚Äôll workout most days, check notifications, mark emails read constantly, etc. I have been thoroughly impressed with the battery life. 

Easily on par if not better than the series 3 I upgraded from in terms of battery life. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if the cellular models drain a little more. Either way I think I‚Äôll see how much better it gets without noise monitoring cause I don‚Äôt really need that. Always on display is clutch on the other hand though.",battery,positive
250,"Battery life depends heavily on how you use the watch. If I only use my S3 as a watch, I can get well into a third day. If I work out, listen to music, etc, I usually have to charge it every other day. or even overnight.",battery,negative
251,"For <$200 I think I'd go with the S5. AOD (which you can always turn off it it's too much of a detriment), larger battery and a newer (read: new) product that will most likely be supported for slightly longer.",battery,negative
252,"I think the internals are mostly the same, apparently same silicone. Just always on display, compass, slightly larger battery, double the storage.",battery,negative
253,"I did my own comparison with both watches for a week straight before choosing the S4. The S5‚Äòs AOD feature was very attractive, but here are a few areas where the S4 outperformed the S5:

1. Battery life - with AOD on, the S5 didn‚Äôt last as long for all of the 7 days. I consistently ended the night with 20% less battery on the S5. I feel like this isn‚Äôt a complete dealbreaker, but battery life is more important to me than AOD.
2. Under the same lighting conditions, the S4 was noticeably brighter than the S5. They‚Äôre both rated at 1000 nits, but the ambient light sensor on the S5 was overly aggressive for my taste. 
3. When raising to wake, the S5 had a noticeably longer lag before fully lighting up.

These are minor differences, but ultimately I got a much better price for the S4 so I kept that instead. No regrets. Can‚Äôt go wrong with either one though.",battery,negative
254,I have S5 and I can tell you first Hand there‚Äôs hardly a difference in battery life having the display on or off. Maybe 20-30 mins at most.,battery,negative

258,"I would want it to be at a full refresh rate while issuing, I would want to decrease the refresh rate of the always ok feature to preserve battery life.",battery,negative
259,"You are totally right. My friend uses his watch more than a simple watch. Notifications, reading email, workout tracking during daily comute so the 3-4 days he gets are impressive. I get 2 days from my Gear S3 so S4 battery life is way better.",battery,positive

261,Yeah it does and I use it at night too but if your sleeve covers the watch it should turn it off anyway. No reason to switch theater mode on and off because it wastes battery in your sleeve,battery,negative
262,What kind of battery life do you get?,battery,negative
263,"I will say this to your first point, after the most recent update to my phone‚Äôs OS (13.1.2), it seems like my watch battery life improved substantially. I wear from 7:00 AM to about 11:00 PM most days. Before the update, my watch would give me the low battery warning between 7:00 and 9:30 PM. After the update I‚Äôve not seen it once.",battery,negative
264,"My battery life is abysmal as others have reported. I've got an open case with Apple support about it. I've also seen threads where beta testers for WatchOS 6.1 say that battery life is improved, so I'm holding out for that.",battery,positive
265,The older devices don't have the controller which reduces the display refresh rate while AOD is active. Sure the older watches could do it but not without a massive hit to the battery life.,battery,negative
266,"Sheesh that last post did NOT get proof read. Sorry. I mean when not in use but has the ‚Äúalways on‚Äù display on, I would hope to be able to decrease the refresh rate to 0.2Hz or lower (not even sure if that‚Äôs a thing), instead of the 1Hz discussed in the video in order to save battery.",battery,positive

272,"Same internals, except the compass and possibly a larger battery. I would personally get a cheap series 4, but you decide if always on matters enough to you.",battery,negative
273,"Yea, going from a Series 0 to a 4 was monumental in battery life gains.

If you tried to track workouts with a series 0, the battery runs out after 2 hrs. And nothing lags anymore.",battery,positive
274,"> I think the always on display is worth the upgrade from any series

I have a Series 3 and it's always on when I look at it. My first thought when they announced always on display was ""Oh I didn't realize that was ever a problem for anybody"". Good they did it for the people that want it but I hope they leave it as an option in settings so I can turn it off and squeeze a little more battery",battery,positive

The watch has a lot of very neat stuff, but they all fit specific niches.",battery,positive
279,"I think they're arguing things like the additional battery drain this puts on the watch. For example, there's another commenter in this thread saying they would disable the always on display in favor of the slight increase to battery life. I figure for someone who values battery life over all else, the always on display is objectively worse.",battery,negative
280,That 4-5 day battery charge is amazing. I also bought a Versa and love it. I can‚Äôt wait for Apple to get that a 1.5 day battery is not acceptable...especially when you wear one over night and go to workout early. Want that sleep tracking and no need to charge and go feeling. ,battery,positive
281,"I do REALLY like my Gear S3, but it's got nothing on my wife's Watch Series 2. Though, the Gear S3 does have sleep tracking and a true ""Do Not Disturb"" mode. It makes it a GREAT alarm for me as a light sleeper. I have it set to a silent alarm with vibration enabled and that's all I need to wake up in the morning and don't have to worry about disturbing her. Also, the battery life is a bit better than hers. I'm not sure if Apple has improved in that regard since Series 2.",battery,positive
282,"I just want Samsung to improve the integration of the Galaxy Watch with their other wearables and third party media apps. I still don't understand why they don't have a widget to control the Galaxy Buds+ via the watch, or a smart playback detection feature to automatically put playback and volume controls on the primary watchface whenever you're listening to something so I can adjust the volume with my watch instead of double tapping the edges of my Buds+ or pulling out my phone.

The battery life is insane, I get 2 full days of use WITH constant heart rate monitoring turned on, I could get more if I changed it to just monitor every 10 minutes but I also want the Stress monitoring and that requires constant HR updates.",battery,negative

286,Had to change hella settings and disable some apps for the battery to last me nearly all day with average use.,battery,negative
287,"Yeah I tried everything but the fossil was in battery saving mode majority of the time. A good portion of that was user error because of daily charging. Impossible to track sleeping and heart rate overnight. 

Coming from Huawei gt watches, spoiled me with battery life. I could accept the lack of features because it always worked. 

Now I'm using the Samsung watch 46mm and it's the perfect mix between the 2. Everything works and battery life is great.",battery,positive
288,"I had the pebble, loved that thing, but will admit it was gimmicky.

Then I had the Apple Watch Series 2, eh, it was alright but charging every day? Battery gets sucked down if you use it for any fitness stuff very quickly.

Looked at AW watches, like the apple watch to me it‚Äôs just gimmick.  I guess I just don‚Äôt care about checking my messages on my watch.

Now I have a Garmin Forerunner - It‚Äôs the one that works for me.  I get a good week of charge out of it even when active, it tracks my runs, bike rides, monitors my heart rate constantly 24x7,  guess I found what I really wanted the whole time.  I wanted a watch to track my fitness and activities, everything else is secondary, Garmin has this one nailed.  I can use my phone for everything else.   Apple Watch claims to do all of that, and it does, but it just sucks in comparison and the battery life does not lend itself to being too active as in any sports mode it will drain very fast.

Just my two cents.

I switched to an iPhone 7 Plus about a year and a half ago after being a die hard Android fan and to be honest while there is not necessarily anything particularly exciting about the iPhone, it works great and the battery life (one of my biggest gripes about Android) is very consistent in comparison to Android.

So when you look at the entry level, the price do not differ too much  (accounting for student discounts, which are better on Apple).

MacOS is very well optimized and can outperform PC‚Äôs with greater specs in certain productivity programs . Of course it‚Äôs a lot of money but you pay similarly for the offerings from Microsoft (the Surface line-up). For that price I‚Äôd rather pick up a more stable, organized and optimized system to do my productivity on (I don‚Äôt use any Windows-only programs). I payed 1250 euros for the Surface Pro which sucks compared to the MacBook Pro which sells for 1350 euros. Try some video editing on the Surface, you‚Äôll want to jump off a cliff.

333,Same boat as OP.  I had a series 2 AW but the battery is not lasting even half a day and its freezing up and I mostly use it for working out and running.  I actually picked up a Garmin VivoActive 4 to try out but one thing I didn't realize is that with the Garmin in order to transfer your paid Apple music over to the watch internal storage you have to have a PC/Mac and send it over with itunes and Garmin express.  The fact that I don't own a PC now its all Ipads/Iphones makes it a no-go.  I usually like to run without my phone so I like to have music stored on the watch.  I'm starting to lean now on picking up an Apple watch SE and use it strictly for running/working out like the OP.  The nice thing with the AW if you already have a iphone is how seamlessly it just works.  The garmin is very nice and seems to find GPS quickly but it doesn't quite meet my needs.,battery,positive
334,"Honestly I always said I like wear os. It is flawed and I say it to people alot who defend it too much. Sometimes it works great some times it's a mess. In honestly though as a smart watch it does everything you need. Where Apple has had the edge is in its fitness. I don't like Samsung health or alot of things about fit. But they are narrowing the gap 

But for me Garmin does the fitness spot on and the battery life is nice. That's why I wear my Garmin for working out and day to day. And a as wear for when I'm just going on days out or dress up and that is something apple sucks at. Every watch is just a mini looking I phone on your wrist. 

Also as a side people moan about wear battery  but that's just par for the coarse with smartwatches and wear has improved with battery so it's still up there with apple on that.",battery,positive
335,"The Apple watch has some very cool and probably more polished features, but imo it remains beatable until they can make one that last more than a day with regular use.

336,"It's called a ""fitbit.""  Apple watch is a joke with its 14hr battery",battery,negative
337,"Biggest thing is smoothness and fluidity of the OS. Like, it doesn't feel like a pentium 4 trying to run crysis remastered. And the ecosystem and the apple health is much more polished and professional looking than samsung health, which has ads for tiktok on top in their app. Also apple health actually tells you a lot of very useful things about your health and tips to improve it throughout the day. Samsung health kinda has some features like this, but feels all very basic after using the apple watch.

Source: have a watch 3 myself and a apple watch 4 from my gf. Tried both. Watch 3 freezes and stutters on everything. Galaxy Watch 4 seems much smoother on review videos, but still seems to stutter on some animations. UI and watchfaces still don't seem to be as polished as apple watch counterpart. I'm a full Android user but I admit that still, in 2021, no one can make a real apple watch killer yet. The galaxy watch 4 is great, but the apple watch series 6 is better. And the series 7 is around the corner already.

Edit: as one of the answer to my comment pointed out, maybe sometimes it's actually better to have a slightly less powerful cpu but 2-4 days of battery life like my galaxy watch 3 has. My gf's apple watch only lasts a single day, and she barely uses it. Putting things into this perspective maybe it's not so bad to have a slower cpu but 4x the battery life on my watch. But the lack of polished software still stands as a huge barrier",battery,positive
338,Give me a Fenix 6 with WearOS and 7 day battery life and I'm sold,battery,negative
339,"IMO the ticwatch pro 3 is the current ideal smartwatch, I think the dual display tech should be introduced by waaay more people, that combined with its super low power essential mode schedule mode so i can put it to deep sleep at night i get 3 days of battery between charges AND a fluid experience. ONLY thing it's missing is a rotating bezel",battery,negative
340,"I don't understand how the Apple Watch doesn't get significantly more shit for the less than 24 hours rated battery life.. I could not use a watch that I have to charge multiple times a day, that's just such a deal breaker to me. I love that with my ticwatch I can look at the battery, see 30% left, and know that's enough for my full day use",battery,negative
341,"Ok yea true that's a real downside, apple watch is extremely smooth because maybe it has a ""too powerful"" cpu, my gf has to charge it everyday and my galaxy watch 3 lasts 3-4 days. Putting things into that perspective, maybe I'm actually fine with having a less powerful cpu but 4 days of battery more than a powerful and smooth cpu with half a day of battery",battery,positive
342,"For me, with the latest watches (especially TWP3) i think wearos has caught up to the point where it's now about tradeoffs, Apple Watch is clearly superior in hardware quality and software integration, but WearOS offers better battery, more customizations, and a better aesthetic (subjective opinion obviously), plus I think the UI of WearOS, while not always better, has some places that definitely is better",battery,positive
343,"I‚Äôve had the series 0, 3, 4, 5 and now the series 6. None of them have lasted 2 days ever. The longest they have ever lasted is 1.5 days. That is on a non work day. When I‚Äôve basically stayed at home all day and spent most the day sitting down. I could wear it to bed but can‚Äôt do sleep tracking. In that scenario it can last 1.5 days. 

As for lasting 12 hours. I‚Äôve had that many times. Depending on how active I am. If I take my watch off the charger at 6.30 am. Do a 35 minute walk to work and I‚Äôm moderately active then by 7 pm I get the low battery warning. If I was more active and did a lot of work ours it wouldn‚Äôt last long at all. Also if I use it on cellular even for 30 mins it drains a lot.",battery,positive
344,"So I'm going to buy a watch that has less wear apps, less wear watch faces, less battery life then what I have now? Look I was hoping the new wear 3.0 would have the ability to download both wear apps and tizen watch faces. That would be a deal breaker.",battery,positive
345,"Mine lasts 2 days, wearing it for sleep too. Maybe you‚Äôre the one talking out your ass. It‚Äôs not as good battery as the TWP I had, or the Fitbit versa, or the Huawei watch GT, but it‚Äôs the next watch I‚Äôve owned.",battery,negative
346,"It‚Äôs not your activity if you‚Äôre spending most of your time outdoors. The sun is a hell of a lot brighter than  indoor lighting and the face brightens considerably, burning more battery",battery,negative
347,I have a series 6 44mm and have to charge it every 40 hours with everything on and around 50 if I disable raise to wake so yeah apples numbers are bullshit,battery,negative
348,"Battery life, bigger screen and new design would be good enough reason for me to upgrade from the 5 series.",battery,negative
349,Really hope the battery life is improved a lot,battery,positive
350,I‚Äôm looking forward to the 19 hours of battery life,battery,negative
351,It's probably next to impossible to make it thinner and not lose battery life.,battery,negative
352,My battery lasts a day and a half. How long are you getting?,battery,negative
353,I‚Äôd wait for some reviews to see if the battery life is a big step forward,battery,negative
354,God yes. So sick of poor battery life. Worst part about my watch imo,battery,negative
355,I‚Äôm only upgraded to 5 series because of the AOD and battery life.  I didn‚Äôt see the point upgrading to 6 so I skipped that one.,battery,negative
356,"Nah. 

For one they‚Äôve done it before. 

Series 3-4 got thinner and battery life was improved. 

Thickness/Depth is only one measurement.  If the watch gets wider and taller then that‚Äôs going to give them more space inside. 

They can also further miniaturise the other stuff inside to make more space for more battery. 

They can also optimise battery efficiencies. Like even lower power processing and display tech that draws less power.",battery,positive
357,yeah the battery life is really whats pulling me towards finally pulling the trigger. Just wish the features were as drastically different as when you do iphone edging and hold out as long as possible between upgrading.,battery,positive
358,Same here the watch battery still lasts for almost 2 days even after 3.5 years of use,battery,negative
359,I just want to be able to forget to charge it one time and not be screwed. I can do that on my phone just fine.,battery,negative
360,I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt make a charging sleep band.  Plug the watch into a soft band that contains a battery and wear it night.  Then plug in the band to charge all day.,battery,negative
361,"Fair points.  If the battery life was a bit longer I‚Äôd be happier.  I do like the AOD but I need the watch to not die on me before I get home.  Here‚Äôs hoping the 7 series does better, Apple always seems to improve battery life each generation by virtue of advancing tech.",battery,positive
362,"For what it‚Äôs worth my series 6 can go about two days if I don‚Äôt do any workouts. 

I suspect the changes to WatchOS 8 are not going to favour the battery life though   

The enhancements to always on display functionality are very welcome but they probably won‚Äôt help the battery situation",battery,positive
363,"Bad analogy. Just off the top of my head:

-	You can fuel up a car and leave it for a week and its gonna have exactly the same amount of fuel when you leave it.

-	People don‚Äôt have gas stations at their houses.

-	Getting fuel is way way more annoying than recharging your watch.

-	Space isnt a premium in a car, you can make the tank 20% larger without making the car 20% larger.



>	I much rather recharge my Apple Watch once every 5 days than once every 18 hours

Agree to disagree eh? I just don‚Äôt understand this logic.

So you‚Äôre either always aware of what day you last charged your watch or constantly checking how much battery your watch has?

I dont even think about the battery life of my watch, when i take it off at night i put it on the charge. Simple as that, i never even think about the watch having a battery that needs to be recharged.",battery,negative
364,Battery life on the WatchOS8 Beta have been atrocious on my series 6,battery,negative
365,"> Bad analogy

Perhaps. 

But at least I'm not splitting hairs to try to make my absolutely nonsensical opinion fit.

Do you really not see how less battery life is not ideal? It's not a complicated concept. You keep going on and on about routine but fail to realize that if it lasted 5 days, you could still have a routine... just not daily. 

To answer your question: yes I am always 100% aware of my battery charge status. And on my previous fitbit that lasted 3-4 days, when I saw it was at or around 15% battery I knew I could still go like 12-24 hours with it before I needed to recharge. It's really nice seeing 15% battery and not having to rush to a charger or have that be on the back of your head like if you're at the gym or went for a walk with your dog or something.",battery,positive
366,"Dude, it‚Äôs not that I *want less battery life* 

Obviously less battery life is not ideal. 

It‚Äôs that *I want a thinner watch*",battery,negative
367,"WiFi on my Carlyle is turned off, no issues with Google Assistant unless watch and phone are too far to connect via BT.

Turning off WiFi makes a big difference in battery life.",battery,negative
368,"No reason to upgrade from my series 6. I upgraded from a series 2 last year and that was a huge leap. No freezing and I'm actually able to use the workout features without a 30 second delay, the walkie talkie actually works great and is responsive, and I can pick up phone calls from my watch without the whole thing freezing or not responding to taps. This S7 doesn't even have a better battery life.",battery,positive
369,"I just came over to Apple from Android this year. I have a Huawei GT2 that has a lot of cool features and lasts at least 5 days with Always On. It was also ridiculously cheap compared to an AW. It doesn't play nice with my iPhone though so I was hoping to get an AW Series 7 because I thought Apple would extend the battery life. Alas no. The bigger screen will require more juice too, so that 18 hours will be even tighter. I'm very disappointed that the battery life is the same as the Series 6.",battery,negative
370,I just wanted a better battery.,battery,negative
371,"I only have a 4 but the biggest issue I have with aw is the daily charging.  

Coming from amaze fit bip that lasts up to a month between charges it's a real pain.

Even if I had a 6 I would have upgraded for better battery life",battery,positive
372,"Agree - the only thing they could have done for me as a S5 user was a big redesign or significant step forward in battery. There‚Äôs an argument for the health features, but for my use the only big improvement made in the last 3 generations was always-on display. Improved the AW experience for me in every interaction.",battery,positive
373,"Just FYI, the 18 hour battery claim has never been accurate- In practice, the S6 always got at least a day and a half of battery with AOD. I doubt the S7 will consume more power than the S6‚Äôs display, since you‚Äôre looking at pure black more often than not- the total lit up area is prolly going to be very similar to the S6.",battery,negative
374,"How is apple supposed to have a better battery without making it thick and an unwieldy brick? The only battery life solution is new tech, which won‚Äôt just be an apple breakthrough. The battery life is at its upper limit right now for the size of the watch. It is what it is",battery,positive
375,Faster charging is more important than bigger battery imo,battery,negative
376,*Technically* it is a better battery but only enough to cover for the faster charging and bigger and brighter display.,battery,positive
377,"Battery longevity is apples main obsession, apparently. Can‚Äôt imagine how much engineering went into powering a watch 6 with cellular for an entire day. Mine lasts no problem from 5am to around 10pm when I go to sleep.",battery,negative
378,"I switched from Series 3 to SE because of the updating issue. But otherwise it was a solid watch. Sure it‚Äôs nice to update without having to unpair and the new faces are nice. But the battery definitely drains faster

Edit: I did also go from a 42mm to a 40mm as it fits my wrist better",battery,positive
379,"Absolutely. I think it‚Äôs a bit wasteful, and slightly redundant, updating annually for marginal improvements. If you can afford to and following the latest and greatest is what makes you happy, then of course go ahead, but it‚Äôs not my mantra when it comes to tech.

I‚Äôm still rocking my iPhone X. In fact, I had the battery replaced in July and it feels like the day I bought it. I can‚Äôt miss what I haven‚Äôt had, and it‚Äôll easily get me through to iPhone 14, and I reckon the iPhone 15 if I continue to look after it. 5/6 years for a ¬£999 (+¬£69 battery replacement) phone seems pretty sweet to me.",battery,positive
380,"I get that. I feel like battery tech is the limiting factor for a lot of the ‚Äòpremium tries to do everything‚Äô smart devices atm. It‚Äôs incremental at best nowadays.

The 45 min to 80% and 8 min for 8 hour sleep tracking sounds decent to me (as an Apple Watch newbie) as I can already see how that‚Äôll fit into my routine, but I get it. I would probs want something more substantial if I was an existing Watch owner.",battery,positive
381,"Software optimization seems to be how Apple has been improving the iPhone batteries in recent years, not by making a bigger pack",battery,positive
382,They said the always-on display would be 70% brighter outside. So they are burning what they gained in battery capacity and efficiency there. I would expect improved battery life when turning always-on off.,battery,positive
383,"Well they increased the iPhone 13 battery in the same case as the iPhone 12.

I'm not a hardware engineer but they seemed to rework the internals to allow for a bigger battery. Same might be done for Apple Watch I would think.",battery,positive
384,"* More power efficient processor
* More power efficient display (this may have happened since the always-on display is brighter with S7)
* A more useful power reserve mode (not exactly the same thing but it would be helpful)
* Larger battery by making other internals smaller (SoaC, sensors etc)
* That crazy rumor that Apple somehow added battery tech to bands (obviously a crazy long shot but you never know)

Lots of options!",battery,negative
385,DUH....by making better battery? i mean...that would be same size but better in every way...? what is so hard about it wtf.,battery,negative
386,"Yeah I think for a lot of people it will be fine.  I accept I am a pretty weird one as I have no routine.  

I may get up at 6 am or 1PM on any given day just depending on lots of random factors.  

I may have nothing to do for hours after I wake up or have to hit the ground running.  I may be watching netflix for hours before bed or I may be up until my eyes won't stay open working on some project or problem.

So I am always glancing at my watch and seeing under 30% battery at any given time and have to then go put it on the charger where I will usually forget about it and hours later realize I don't have it on and have been missing steps or even maybe left the house without it. 

If I could get at least 4 days between charges I would be a much happier camper.",battery,negative

To get more than 24 hrs, you‚Äôd likely have to use it very lightly or turn some things off.",battery,negative
394,"> Most because Apple doesn't really experiment

Except with unibody design, retina displays, slo-mo video recording, touchID, force touch, taptic, the M-series chips, a lot of custom battery tech... - even the iPhone 4 antenna design was an experiment, albeit one that didn't work.

395,"Downvotes don't prove what you think they prove. Stop acting like they make you a martyr for your ideas. 

As someone who spends most of their time on /r/android, you comments just seem random rather than supporting an idea. 

It is more of a collection of waring tribes than a community. 

Also most recent every day reports seem to saw battery on the S6 is not adequate but quick charge is nice. Wireless charging is still slow.
